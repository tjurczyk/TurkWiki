The only undisputed facts are that the fighting began at 9 am on Saturday 14 October 1066 and that the battle lasted until dusk.<br/>3. Sunset on the day of the battle was at 4:54 pm, with the battlefield mostly dark by 5:54 pm and in full darkness by 6:24 pm.<br/>4. Moonrise that night was not until 11:12 pm, so once the sun set, there was little light on the battlefield.<br/>5. William of Jumieges reports that Duke William kept his army armed and ready against a surprise night attack for the entire night before.<br/>6. The battle took place north of Hastings at the present-day town of Battle, between two hills – Caldbec Hill to the north and Telham Hill to the south.<br/>7. The area was heavily wooded, with a marsh nearby.<br/>8. The name traditionally given to the battle is unusual – there were several settlements much closer to the battlefield than Hastings.<br/>9. The ""Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"" called it the battle ""at the hoary apple tree"".<br/>10. Within 40 years, the battle was also known as ""Senlac"", a Norman-French adaptation of the Old English word ""Sandlacu"", which means ""sandy water"".<br/>11. This may have been the name of the stream that crosses the battlefield.<br/>12. The battle was already being referred to as ""bellum Hasestingas"" or ""Battle of Hastings"" by 1087, in the ""Domesday Book"".Sunrise was at 6:48 am that morning, and reports of the day record that it was unusually bright.<br/>13. The weather conditions are not recorded.<br/>14. The route that the English army took to the battlefield is not known precisely.<br/>15. Several roads are possible: one, an old Roman road that ran from Rochester to Hastings has long been favoured because of a large coin hoard found nearby in 1876.<br/>16. Another possibility is a Roman road between London and Lewes and then over local tracks to the battlefield.<br/>17. Some accounts of the battle indicate that the Normans advanced from Hastings to the battlefield, but the contemporary account of William of Jumieges places the Normans at the site of the battle the night before.<br/>18. Most historians incline towards the former view, but M. K. Lawson argues that William of Jumieges's account is correct.<br/>",10,Which Norman-French word refers to the Battle of Hastings?,,

Belgium covers an area of , and it has a population of about 11 million people.Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community (which constitutes about 59% of the population), and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population (which comprises 41% of all Belgians).<br/>4. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers that are officially recognized.<br/>5. Belgium's two largest regions are the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders in the north and the French-speaking southern region of Wallonia.<br/>6. The Brussels-Capital Region, officially bilingual, is a mostly French-speaking enclave within the Flemish Region.<br/>7. *A German-speaking Community exists in eastern Wallonia.Belgium's linguistic diversity and related political conflicts are reflected in its political history and complex system of government.Historically, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg were known as the Low Countries, which used to cover a somewhat larger area than the current Benelux group of states.<br/>8. The region was called Belgica in Latin, after the Roman province of Gallia Belgica, which covered more or less the same area.<br/>9.

From the 16th century until the Belgian Revolution in 1830, when Belgium seceded from the Netherlands, the area of Belgium served as the battleground between many European powers, causing it to be dubbed the ""Battlefield of Europe,""*a reputation strengthened by both World Wars.Upon its independence, Belgium participated in the Industrial Revolutionand, during the course of the 20th century, possessed a number of colonies in Africa.The second half of the 20th century was marked by rising tensions between the Flemish and the Francophones fueled by differences in language and the unequal economic development of Flanders and Wallonia.<br/>11.

As intriguing as geometric Newtonian gravity may be, its basis, classical mechanics, is merely a limiting case of (special) relativistic mechanics.<br/>2. In the language of symmetry: where gravity can be neglected, physics is Lorentz invariant as in special relativity rather than Galilei invariant as in classical mechanics.<br/>3. (The defining symmetry of special relativity is the Poincaré group which also includes translations and rotations.)<br/>4. The differences between the two become significant when we are dealing with speeds approaching the speed of light, and with high-energy phenomena.With Lorentz symmetry, additional structures come into play.<br/>5. They are defined by the set of light cones (see the image on the left).<br/>6. The light-cones define a causal structure: for each event A, there is a set of events that can, in principle, either influence or be influenced by A via signals or interactions that do not need to travel faster than light (such as event B in the image), and a set of events for which such an influence is impossible (such as event C in the image).<br/>7. These sets are observer-independent.<br/>8. In conjunction with the world-lines of freely falling particles, the light-cones can be used to reconstruct the space–time's semi-Riemannian metric, at least up to a positive scalar factor.<br/>9. In mathematical terms, this defines a conformal structure.Special relativity is defined in the absence of gravity, so for practical applications, it is a suitable model whenever gravity can be neglected.<br/>10. Bringing gravity into play, and assuming the universality of free fall, an analogous reasoning as in the previous section applies: there are no global inertial frames.<br/>11. Instead there are approximate inertial frames moving alongside freely falling particles.<br/>12. Translated into the language of spacetime: the straight time-like lines that define a gravity-free inertial frame are deformed to lines that are curved relative to each other, suggesting that the inclusion of gravity necessitates a change in spacetime geometry.A priori, it is not clear whether the new local frames in free fall coincide with the reference frames in which the laws of special relativity hold—that theory is based on the propagation of light, and thus on electromagnetism, which could have a different set of preferred frames.<br/>13. But using different assumptions about the special-relativistic frames (such as their being earth-fixed, or in free fall), one can derive different predictions for the gravitational redshift, that is, the way in which the frequency of light shifts as the light propagates through a gravitational field (cf.<br/>14. below).<br/>15. The actual measurements show that free-falling frames are the ones in which light propagates as it does in special relativity.<br/>16. The generalization of this statement, namely that the laws of special relativity hold to good approximation in freely falling (and non-rotating) reference frames, is known as the Einstein equivalence principle, a crucial guiding principle for generalizing special-relativistic physics to include gravity.The same experimental data shows that time as measured by clocks in a gravitational field—proper time, to give the technical term—does not follow the rules of special relativity.<br/>17. In the language of spacetime geometry, it is not measured by the Minkowski metric.<br/>18. As in the Newtonian case, this is suggestive of a more general geometry.<br/>19. At small scales, all reference frames that are in free fall are equivalent, and approximately Minkowskian.<br/>20. Consequently, we are now dealing with a curved generalization of Minkowski space.<br/>21. The metric tensor that defines the geometry—in particular, how lengths and angles are measured—is not the Minkowski metric of special relativity, it is a generalization known as a semi- or pseudo-Riemannian metric.<br/>22. Furthermore, each Riemannian metric is naturally associated with one particular kind of connection, the Levi-Civita connection, and this is, in fact, the connection that satisfies the equivalence principle and makes space locally Minkowskian (that is, in suitable locally inertial coordinates, the metric is Minkowskian, and its first partial derivatives and the connection coefficients vanish).<br/>",15,In what type  of frames does light propagate in the same way as it does in special relativity?,,

However, Woodroof did lose all his friends after they found out he was HIV-positive.<br/>3. In his interviews with Borten, Woodroof implied that this, along with interactions with gay people living with AIDS through the buyers club, led to a rethinking of his apparent anti-gay sentiments and changed his views on gay people.<br/>4.

The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain , is a sovereign state located off the north-western coast of continental Europe.<br/>2. The country includes the island of Great Britain (a term sometimes loosely applied to the whole state), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands.<br/>3. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another state: the Republic of Ireland.<br/>4. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea in the east, the English Channel in the south and the Irish Sea in the west.The UK's form of government is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system, and its capital city is London.<br/>5. The current British monarch—since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II.<br/>6. The United Kingdom consists of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.<br/>7. The latter three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capital cities, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, respectively.<br/>8. Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man are Crown dependencies and are not part of the UK.<br/>9. The United Kingdom has fourteen British Overseas Territories.<br/>10. These are remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history.<br/>11. British influence can be observed in the language, culture and legal systems of many of its former colonies.The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's sixth-largest economy by nominal GDP and eighth-largest by purchasing power parity.<br/>12. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries.<br/>13. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally.<br/>14. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks fourth in the world.The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946.<br/>15. It has been a member of the European Union (EU) and its predecessor the European Economic Community (EEC) since 1973; it is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7, the G8, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Trade Organization (WTO).<br/>",5,Who was the monarch in Britain since 1952?,,

To win dive meets, divers create a dive list in advance of the meet.<br/>2. To win the meet the diver must accumulate more points than other divers.<br/>3. Often, simple dives with low DDs will look good to spectators but will not win meets.<br/>4. The competitive diver will attempt the highest DD dives possible with which they can achieve consistent, high scores.<br/>5. If divers are scoring 8 or 9 on most dives, it may be a sign of their extreme skill, or it may be a sign that their dive list is not competitive, and they may lose the meet to a diver with higher DDs and lower scores.In competition, divers must submit their lists beforehand, and once past a deadline (usually when the event is announced or shortly before it begins) they cannot change their dives.<br/>6. If they fail to perform the dive announced, even if they physically cannot execute the dive announced or if they perform a more difficult dive, they will receive a score of zero.<br/>7. Under exceptional circumstances, a redive may be granted, but these are exceedingly rare (usually for very young divers just learning how to compete, or if some event outside the diver's control has caused them to be unable to perform).In the Olympics or other highly competitive meets, many divers will have nearly the same list of dives as their competitors.<br/>8. The importance for divers competing at this level is not so much the DD, but how they arrange their list.<br/>9. Once the more difficult rounds of dives begin it is important to lead off with a confident dive to build momentum.<br/>10. They also tend to put a very confident dive in front of a very difficult dive to ensure that they will have a good mentality for the difficult dive.<br/>11. Most divers have pre-dive and post-dive rituals that help them either maintain or regain focus.<br/>12. Coaches also play a role in this aspect of the sport.<br/>13. Many divers rely on their coaches to help keep their composure during the meet.<br/>14. In a large meet coaches are rarely allowed on the deck to talk to their athlete so it is common to see coaches using hand gestures to communicate.There are some American meets which will allow changes of the position of the dive even after the dive has been announced immediately before execution, but these are an exception to the rules generally observed internationally.Generally, NCAA rules allow for dives to be changed while the diver is on the board, but the diver must request the change directly after the dive is announced.<br/>15. This applies especially in cases where the wrong dive is announced.<br/>16. If the diver pauses during his or her hurdle to ask for a change of dive, it will be declared a balk and the change of dive will not be permitted.Under FINA law, no dive may be changed after the deadline for the dive-sheet to be submitted (generally a period ranging from one hour to 24 hours, depending on the rulings made by the event organiser).It is the diver's responsibility to ensure that the dive-sheet is filled in correctly, and also to correct the referee or announcer before the dive if they describe it incorrectly.<br/>17. If a dive is performed which is as submitted but not as (incorrectly) announced, it is declared failed and scores zero according to a strict reading of the FINA law.<br/>18. But in practice, a re-dive would usually be granted in these circumstances.<br/>",6,When is a score of zero awarded in a dive?,,

Costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard created a three-dimensional model of actor Tom Hardy's face and skull to design the mask, allowing the mask to perfectly conform to the contours of Hardy's face.<br/>7. Hemming personally designed Bane's coat, which she admitted took two years to complete.<br/>8. Taking inspiration from a Swedish army jacket and a frock coat from the French Revolution, it was designed to make Bane look like equal parts dictatorial and revolutionary.<br/>9. The design was difficult as Hemming struggled to find a tailor in Los Angeles who could work with shearling.The Batsuit consisted of 110 separate pieces, each of which had to be replicated dozens of times over the course of the production.<br/>10. The base layer was made of a polyester mesh that is utilized by the military and high-tech sports manufacturers because of its breathability and moisture-wicking properties.<br/>11. Molded pieces of flexible urethane were then attached to the mesh, to form the overall body armor plating.<br/>12. Carbon fiber panels were placed inside the sections on the legs, chest and abdomen.<br/>13.

The most common difference between a regular runabout and a wakeboarding boat is the wakeboard tower, normally constructed of thick-walled stainless steel or aluminum tubing, which places the ""pull point"" about off the water's surface.<br/>2. The high tow point makes it easier to jump and get air as the rope is not pulling downward as when it is attached to the low tow point used for skiing.<br/>3. Most modern wakeboarding boats also have a variable ballast system, which allows for water to be pumped into and out of ballast tanks from the surrounding water.<br/>4. Adding ballast increases displacement, and consequently enlarges the wake produced.A significant portion of wakeboarding boats utilizes V-drive propulsion.<br/>5. These boats have a regular inboard engine, but are turned 180° such that the transmission is in front of the engine, rather than behind, or ""inline"", which is a more common layout for inboard tournament ski boats.<br/>6. The prop shaft exits the transmission towards the rear of the boat, so that the prop is placed directly under the engine.<br/>7. When viewed from the side, such a layout appears as a ""V"" lying on its side.<br/>8. This layout allows for better weight distribution(with the engine farther aft), and places the prop farther forward, reducing the danger of the spinning prop near the stern of the vessel, where riders enter and exit the water.<br/>",2,Why is it easier to jump with a wakeboarding boat?,,

The chloroplasts of plants have a number of biochemical, structural and genetic similarities to cyanobacteria, (commonly but incorrectly known as ""blue-green algae"") and are thought to be derived from an ancient endosymbiotic relationship between an ancestral eukaryotic cell and a cyanobacterial resident.The algae are a polyphyletic group and are placed in various divisions, some more closely related to plants than others.<br/>2. There are many differences between them in features such as cell wall composition, biochemistry, pigmentation, chloroplast structure and nutrient reserves.<br/>3. The algal division Charophyta, sister to the green algal division Chlorophyta, is considered to contain the ancestor of true plants.<br/>4. The Charophyte class Charophyceae and the land plant sub-kingdom Embryophyta together form the monophyletic group or clade Streptophytina.Nonvascular land plants are embryophytes that lack the vascular tissues xylem and phloem.<br/>5. They include mosses, liverworts and hornworts.<br/>6. Pteridophytic vascular plants with true xylem and phloem that reproduced by spores germinating into free-living gametophytes evolved during the Silurian period and diversified into several lineages during the late Silurian and early Devonian.<br/>7. Representatives of the lycopods have survived to the present day.<br/>8. By the end of the Devonian period, several groups, including the lycopods, sphenophylls and progymnosperms, had independently evolved ""megaspory"" – their spores were of two distinct sizes, larger megaspores and smaller microspores.<br/>9. Their reduced gametophytes developed from megaspores retained within the spore-producing organs (megasporangia) of the sporophyte, a condition known as endospory.<br/>10. Seeds consist of an endosporic megasporangium surrounded by one or two sheathing layers (integuments).<br/>11. The young sporophyte develops within the seed, which on germination splits to release it.<br/>12. The earliest known seed plants date from the latest Devonian Famennian stage.<br/>13. Following the evolution of the seed habit, seed plants diversified, giving rise to a number of now-extinct groups, including seed ferns, as well as the modern gymnosperms and angiosperms.<br/>14. Gymnosperms produce ""naked seeds"" not fully enclosed in an ovary; modern representatives include conifers, cycads, ""Ginkgo"", and Gnetales.<br/>15. Angiosperms produce seeds enclosed in a structure such as a carpel or an ovary.<br/>16. Ongoing research on the molecular phylogenetics of living plants appears to show that the angiosperms are a sister clade to the gymnosperms.<br/>",14,What are some modern examples of gymnosperms?,,

The cathedral treasury is notable for its reliquary which houses some of Catholicism's most important first-class relics including the purported Crown of Thorns, a fragment of the True Cross, and one of the Holy Nails.In the 1790s, Notre-Dame suffered desecration during the radical phase of the French Revolution when much of its religious imagery was damaged or destroyed.<br/>5.

On , the Bolsheviks' Central Committee voted 10-2 for a resolution saying that ""an armed uprising is inevitable, and that the time for it is fully ripe"".On , Bolshevik leader Jaan Anvelt led his leftist revolutionaries in an uprising in Tallinn, the capital of the Autonomous Governorate of Estonia.<br/>2. Two days later, Bolsheviks led their forces in the uprising in Petrograd (modern day Saint Petersburg), the capital of Russia, against the Kerensky Provisional Government.<br/>3. For the most part, the revolt in Petrograd was bloodless, with the Red Guards led by Bolsheviks taking over major government facilities with little opposition before finally launching an assault on the poorly defended Winter Palace.The official Soviet version of events follows: An assault led by Vladimir Lenin was launched at 9:45 p.m. signaled by a blank shot from the cruiser ""Aurora"".<br/>4. (The ""Aurora"" was placed in Petrograd and still stands there now.)<br/>5. The Winter Palace was guarded by Cossacks, cadets (military students), and a Women's Battalion.<br/>6. It was taken at about 2 a.m.<br/>7. The earlier date was made the official date of the Revolution, when all offices except the Winter Palace had been taken.<br/>8. More contemporary research with access to government archives significantly corrects accepted Soviet edited and embellished history.<br/>9. The archival version shows that parties of Bolshevik operatives sent out from the Smolny by Lenin took over all critical centers of power in Petrograd in the early hours of the night without a shot being fired.<br/>10. In fact the effectively unoccupied Winter Palace also was taken bloodlessly by a small group which broke in, got lost in the cavernous interior, and accidentally happened upon the remnants of Kerensky's provisional government in the imperial family's breakfast room.<br/>11. The illiterate revolutionaries then compelled those arrested to write up their own arrest papers.<br/>12. The stories of the ""defense of the Winter Palace"" and the heroic ""Storming of the Winter Palace"" came later as the creative propaganda product of Bolshevik publicists.<br/>13. Grandiose paintings depicting the ""Women's Battalion"" and photo stills taken from Sergei Eisenstein's staged film depicting the ""politically correct"" version of the October events in Petrograd came to be taken as truth.Later official accounts of the revolution from the Soviet Union would depict the events in October as being far more dramatic than they actually had been.<br/>14. (See firsthand account by British General Knox.)<br/>15. This was helped by the historical reenactment, entitled ""The Storming of the Winter Palace"", which was staged in 1920.<br/>16. This reenactment, watched by 100,000 spectators, provided the model for official films made much later, which showed a huge storming of the Winter Palace and fierce fighting (See Sergei Eisenstein's """").<br/>17. In reality the Bolshevik insurgents faced little or no opposition.<br/>18. The insurrection was timed and organized to hand state power to the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, which began on 25 October.<br/>19.

The Delft master's modern rediscovery began about 1860, when the German museum director Gustav Waagen saw ""The Art of Painting"" in the Czernin gallery in Vienna, and recognized as a Vermeer the work which was at that time attributed to Pieter de Hooch.<br/>3. Research by Théophile Thoré-Bürger culminated in the publication in 1866 of his catalogue raisonné of Vermeer's works in the ""Gazette des Beaux-Arts"".<br/>4. Thoré-Bürger's catalogue, which drew international attention to Vermeer, listed more than seventy works by Vermeer, including many he regarded as uncertain.<br/>5. The accepted number of Vermeer's paintings today is thirty-four.Upon the rediscovery of Vermeer's work, several prominent Dutch artists, including Simon Duiker, modelled their style on his work.<br/>6. Other artists who were inspired by Vermeer include the Danish painter Wilhelm Hammershoi and the American Thomas Wilmer Dewing.<br/>7. In the 20th century, Vermeer's admirers included Salvador Dalí, who painted his own version of ""The Lacemaker"" and pitted large copies of the original against a rhinoceros in some now-famous surrealist experiments.<br/>8.

It accounts for 4.5% of GDP, employs about 160,000 people (4% of the workforce), and represents 1/3 of the country's trade deficit.During the 1960s, the size of the Greek fleet nearly doubled, primarily through the investment undertaken by the shipping magnates, Aristotle Onassis and Stavros Niarchos.<br/>4.

Beginning a process from which Argentina was to emerge as successor state to the Viceroyalty, the 1810 May Revolution replaced the viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros with the First Junta, a new government in Buenos Aires composed by locals.<br/>2. In the first clashes of the Independence War the Junta crushed a royalist counter-revolution in Córdoba, but failed to overcome those of the Banda Oriental, Upper Peru and Paraguay, which later became independent states.<br/>3. Revolutionaries split into two antagonist groups: the Centralists and the Federalists—a move that would define Argentina's first decades of independence.<br/>4. The Assembly of the Year XIII appointed Gervasio Antonio de Posadas as Argentina's first Supreme Director.In 1816 the Congress of Tucumán formalized the Declaration of Independence.<br/>5. One year later General Martín Miguel de Güemes stopped royalists on the North, and General José de San Martín took an army across the Andes and secured the independence of Chile; then he led the fight to the Spanish stronghold of Lima and proclaimed the independence of Peru.<br/>6. In 1819 Buenos Aires enacted a centralist constitution that was soon abrogated by federalists.The 1820 Battle of Cepeda, fought between the Centralists and the Federalists, resulted in the end of the Supreme Director rule.<br/>7. In 1826 Buenos Aires enacted another centralist constitution, with Bernardino Rivadavia being appointed as the first president of the country.<br/>8. However, the interior provinces soon rose against him, forced his resignation and discarded the constitution.<br/>9. Centralists and Federalists resumed the civil war; the latter prevailed and formed the Argentine Confederation in 1831, led by Juan Manuel de Rosas.<br/>10. During his regime he faced a French blockade (1838–1840), the War of the Confederation (1836–1839), and a combined Anglo-French blockade (1845–1850), but remained undefeated and prevented further loss of national territory.<br/>11. His trade restriction policies, however, angered the interior provinces and in 1852 Justo José de Urquiza, another powerful caudillo, beat him out of power.<br/>12. As new president of the Confederation, Urquiza enacted the liberal and federal 1853 Constitution.<br/>13.

The ""Luftwaffe""'s four primary bombers were the Heinkel He 111, Dornier Do 17, and Junkers Ju 88 for level bombing, and the Junkers Ju 87 ""Stuka"" for diving attacks.<br/>2. The Heinkel He 111 was used in greater numbers than the others during the conflict and is better known, partly due to its distinctive wing shape.<br/>3. Each level bomber also had a few reconnaissance versions that were used during the battle.Although successful in previous ""Luftwaffe"" engagements, the ""Stuka"" suffered heavy losses in the Battle of Britain, particularly on 18 August, due to its slow speed and vulnerability to fighter interception after the dive bombing.<br/>4. As a result of the losses and limited payload and range, ""Stuka"" units were largely removed from operations over England and concentrated on shipping instead until they were re-deployed to the Eastern Front in 1941.<br/>5. They returned on occasion, such as on 13 September to attack Tangmere airfield.The remaining three bomber types differed in their capabilities; the Heinkel 111 was the slowest; the Ju 88 was the fastest once its mainly external bomb load was dropped; and the Do 17 had the smallest bomb load.<br/>6. All three bomber types suffered heavy losses from British fighters, but the Ju 88 disproportionately so.<br/>7. The German bombers required constant protection by the ""Luftwaffe""'s fighter force.<br/>8. There were not enough Bf 109Es to support more than 300–400 bombers on any given day.<br/>9. Later in the conflict, when night bombing became more frequent, all three were used.<br/>10. However, due to its reduced bomb load, the lighter Do 17 was used less than the He 111 and Ju 88 for this purpose.On the British side, three bomber types were mostly used on night operations against targets such as factories, invasion ports and railway centres; the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley, the Handley-Page Hampden and the Vickers Wellington were classified as heavy bombers by the RAF, although the Hampden was a medium bomber comparable to the He 111.<br/>11. The twin-engined Bristol Blenheim and the obsolescent single-engined Fairey Battle were both light bombers; the Blenheim was the most numerous of the aircraft equipping RAF Bomber Command and was used in attacks against shipping, ports, airfields and factories on the continent by day and by night.<br/>12. The Fairey Battle squadrons, which had suffered heavy losses in daylight attacks during the Battle of France, were brought up to strength with reserve aircraft and continued to operate at night in attacks against the invasion ports, until the Battle was withdrawn from UK front line service in October 1940.<br/>",10,Why was the Do 17 less frequently used than other planes for night bomb in the Battle of Britain?,,

The rules state that the body should be vertical, or nearly so, for entry.<br/>2. Strictly speaking, it is physically impossible to achieve a literally vertical position throughout the entry as there will inevitably still be some rotational momentum while the body is entering the water.<br/>3. Divers therefore attempt to create the illusion of being vertical, especially when performing rapidly rotating multiple somersault movements.<br/>4. One technique is to allow the upper body to enter slightly short of vertical so that the continuing rotation leaves the final impression of the legs entering vertically.<br/>5. Another is to use ""entry save"" movements of scooping the upper body underwater in the direction of rotation so as to counteract the rotation of the legs.The arms must be beside the body for feet-first dives, which are typically competed only on the 1m springboard and only at fairly low levels of competition, and extended forwards in line for ""head-first"" dives, which are much more common competitively.<br/>6. It used to be common for the hands to be interlocked with the fingers extended towards the water, but a different technique has become favoured during the last few decades.<br/>7. Now the usual practice is for one hand to grasp the other with palms down to strike the water with a flat surface.<br/>8. This creates a vacuum between the hands, arms and head which, with a vertical entry, will pull down and under any splash until deep enough to have minimal effect on the surface of the water (the so-called ""rip entry"").<br/>9. Once a diver is completely under the water they may choose to roll or scoop in the same direction their dive was rotating to pull their legs into a more vertical position.<br/>",2,Why is it impossible to achieve a completely vertical position through entry when diving?,,

The final process is called ""tempering"".<br/>2. Uncontrolled crystallization of cocoa butter typically results in crystals of varying size, some or all large enough to be clearly seen with the naked eye.<br/>3. This causes the surface of the chocolate to appear mottled and matte, and causes the chocolate to crumble rather than snap when broken.<br/>4. The uniform sheen and crisp bite of properly processed chocolate are the result of consistently small cocoa butter crystals produced by the tempering process.The fats in cocoa butter can crystallize in six different forms (polymorphous crystallization).<br/>5. The primary purpose of tempering is to assure that only the best form is present.<br/>6. The six different crystal forms have different properties.As a solid piece of chocolate, the cocoa butter fat particles are in a crystalline rigid structure that gives the chocolate its solid appearance.<br/>7. Once heated, the crystals of the polymorphic cocoa butter will be able to break apart from the rigid structure and allow the chocolate to obtain a more fluid consistency as the temperature increases.<br/>8. This is known as the melting process.<br/>9. When the heat is removed, the cocoa butter crystals will become rigid again and come closer together, allowing the chocolate to solidify.This temperature in which the crystals obtain enough energy to break apart from their rigid conformation would depend on the milk fat content in the chocolate and the shape of the fat molecules as well as the form of the cocoa butter fat.<br/>10. Chocolate with a higher fat content will melt at a lower temperature.Making chocolate considered ""good"" is about forming as many type V crystals as possible.<br/>11. This provides the best appearance and texture and creates the most stable crystals, so the texture and appearance will not degrade over time.<br/>12. To accomplish this, the temperature is carefully manipulated during the crystallization.Generally, the chocolate is first heated to to melt all six forms of crystals.<br/>13. Next, the chocolate is cooled to about , which will allow crystal types IV and V to form.<br/>14. At this temperature, the chocolate is agitated to create many small crystal ""seeds"" which will serve as nuclei to create small crystals in the chocolate.<br/>15. The chocolate is then heated to about to eliminate any type IV crystals, leaving just type V. After this point, any excessive heating of the chocolate will destroy the temper and this process will have to be repeated.<br/>16. However, there are other methods of chocolate tempering used.<br/>17. The most common variant is introducing already tempered, solid ""seed"" chocolate.<br/>18. The temper of chocolate can be measured with a chocolate temper meter to ensure accuracy and consistency.<br/>19. A sample cup is filled with the chocolate and placed in the unit which then displays or prints the results.Two classic ways of manually tempering chocolate are:<br/>20. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Working the molten chocolate on a heat-absorbing surface, such as a stone slab, until thickening indicates the presence of sufficient crystal ""seeds""; the chocolate is then gently warmed to working temperature.<br/>21. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stirring solid chocolate into molten chocolate to ""inoculate"" the liquid chocolate with crystals (this method uses the already formed crystals of the solid chocolate to ""seed"" the molten chocolate).<br/><br/>22. Chocolate tempering machines (or temperers) with computer controls can be used for producing consistently tempered chocolate, particularly for large volume applications.</br>",4,Why does properly processed chocolate have a uniform sheen and crisp bite?,,

Sunspots are regions of lower-than- average temperatures that are associated with intense magnetic activity.The Sun has steadily increased in luminosity over the course of its life, increasing by 40% since it first became a main-sequence star.<br/>5. The Sun has also undergone periodic changes in luminosity that can have a significant impact on the Earth.<br/>6. The Maunder minimum, for example, is believed to have caused the Little Ice Age phenomenon during the Middle Ages.The visible outer surface of the Sun is called the photosphere.<br/>7.

During the period of the Austro-Hungarian rule in Transylvania and Ottoman suzerainty over Wallachia and Moldavia, most Romanians were considered second-class citizens or even non-citizens in a territory where they formed the majority of the population.Following the Wallachian uprising of 1821, more insurrections followed in 1848 in Wallachia as well as Moldavia.<br/>2. The flag adopted for Wallachia by the revolutionaries was a blue-yellow-red horizontal tricolour (with blue above, in line with the meaning ""Liberty, Justice, Fraternity""), while Romanian students in Paris hailed the new government with the same flag ""as a symbol of union between Moldavians and Muntenians"".<br/>3. The same flag, with the tricolour being mounted vertically, would later on be officially adopted as the national flag of Romania.After the failed 1848 Revolution, the Great Powers did not support the Romanians' expressed desire to officially unite in a one single state, which forced them to proceed alone with their struggle against the Ottomans.<br/>4. The electors in both Moldavia and Wallachia chose in 1859 the same leader –Alexandru Ioan Cuza– to be their Ruling Prince (""Domnitor"" in Romanian).<br/>5. Thus, Romania was created as a personal union, albeit without including Transylvania.<br/>6. There, the upper class and the aristocracy chose to remain under Hungarian rule, even though the Romanians were by far the most numerous ethnic Transylvanian group and constituted the absolute majority.In an 1866 ""coup d'état"", Cuza was exiled and replaced by Prince Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, who became known as Prince Carol I of Romania.<br/>7. During the 1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War Romania fought on the Russian side, and as a result of it in the Treaty of San Stefano and the Treaty of Berlin, Romania was recognized as an independent state both by the Ottoman Empire and the Great Powers.<br/>8. In return, Romania ceded the district of Bessarabia to Russia and acquired Dobruja.<br/>9. In 1881, the principality was raised to a kingdom and Prince Carol became King Carol I of Romania.The 1878–1914 period was one of stability and progress for Romania.<br/>10.

From the 8th to the 10th century, the Danes, as well as Norwegians and Swedes, were known as Vikings.<br/>2. They colonised, raided, and traded in all parts of Europe.<br/>3. Viking explorers first discovered Iceland by accident in the 9th century, on the way towards the Faroe Islands and eventually came across ""Vinland"" (Land of wine), also known today as Newfoundland, a province in Canada.<br/>4. The Danish Vikings were most active in the British Isles and Western Europe.<br/>5. They conquered and settled parts of England (known as the Danelaw) under King Sweyn Forkbeard in 1013, Ireland, and France where they founded Normandy.<br/>6. More Anglo-Saxon pence of this period have been found in Denmark than in England.As attested by the Jelling stones, the Danes were united and Christianised about 965 by Harald Bluetooth.<br/>7. It is believed that Denmark became Christian for political reasons so as not to get invaded by the rising Christian power in Europe, Germania, which was an important trading area for the Danes.<br/>8. In that case Harald built six fortresses around Denmark called Trelleborg and built a further Danevirke.<br/>9. In the early 11th century, Canute the Great won and united Denmark, England, and Norway for almost 30 years.Throughout the High and Late Middle Ages, Denmark also included Skåneland (Skåne, Halland, and Blekinge) and Danish kings ruled Danish Estonia, as well as the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein.<br/>10. Most of the latter two now form the state of Schleswig-Holstein in northern Germany.In 1397, Denmark entered into a personal union with Norway and Sweden, united under Queen Margaret I.<br/>11. The three countries were to be treated as equals in the union.<br/>12. However, even from the start Margaret may not have been so idealistic—treating Denmark as the clear ""senior"" partner of the union.<br/>13. Thus, much of the next 125 years of Scandinavian history revolves around this union, with Sweden breaking off and being re-conquered repeatedly.<br/>14. The issue was for practical purposes resolved on 17 June 1523, as Swedish King Gustav Vasa conquered the city of Stockholm.The Protestant Reformation came to Scandinavia in the 1530s, and following the Count's Feud civil war, Denmark converted to Lutheranism in 1536.<br/>15. Later that year, Denmark entered into a union with Norway.<br/>",4,Where were the Danish Vikings most active?,,

Einstein continued to maintain his disbelief in the theory, and attempted unsuccessfully to disprove it until he died at the age of 76.<br/>3. In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in ""Physikalische Zeitschrift"" that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser.This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode.<br/>4. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws.Einstein discovered Louis de Broglie's work, and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first.<br/>5.

The original type of sushi, known today as ""nare-zushi"" (,) was first made in Southeast Asia, possibly along what is now known as the Mekong River.<br/>2. The term ""sushi"" comes from an archaic grammatical form no longer used in other contexts; literally, ""sushi"" means ""sour-tasting"", a reflection of its historic fermented origins.<br/>3. The oldest form of sushi in Japan, ""narezushi"", still very closely resembles this process, wherein fish is fermented via being wrapped in soured fermenting rice.<br/>4. The fish proteins break down via fermentation into their constituent amino acids.<br/>5. The fermenting rice and fish results in a sour taste and also one of the five basic tastes, called ""umami"" in Japanese.<br/>6. Contemporary Japanese sushi has little resemblance to the traditional lacto-fermented rice dish.<br/>7. Originally, when the fermented fish was taken out of the rice, only the fish was consumed while the fermented rice was discarded.<br/>8. The strong-tasting and smelling ""funazushi"", a kind of ""narezushi"" made near Lake Biwa in Japan, resembles the traditional fermented dish.<br/>9. Beginning in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) of Japan, vinegar was added to the mixture for better taste and preservation.<br/>10. The vinegar accentuated the rice's sourness and was known to increase its shelf life, allowing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually abandoned.<br/>11. In the following centuries, sushi in Osaka evolved into ""oshi-zushi"".<br/>12. The seafood and rice were pressed using wooden (usually bamboo) molds.<br/>13. By the mid 18th century, this form of sushi had reached Edo (contemporary Tokyo).The contemporary version, internationally known as ""sushi"", was created by Hanaya Yohei (1799–1858) at the end of the Edo period in Edo.<br/>14. Sushi invented by Hanaya was an early form of fast food that was not fermented (therefore prepared quickly) and could be conveniently eaten with one's hands.<br/>15. Originally, this sushi was known as ""Edomae zushi"" because it used freshly caught fish in the ""Edo-mae"" (Edo Bay or Tokyo Bay).<br/>16. Though the fish used in modern sushi no longer usually comes from Tokyo Bay, it is still formally known as ""Edomae nigirizushi"".The ""Oxford English Dictionary"" notes the earliest written mention of sushi in English in an 1893 book, ""A Japanese Interior"", where it mentions sushi as """"a roll of cold rice with fish, sea-weed, or some other flavoring"""".<br/>17. However, there is also mention of sushi in a Japanese-English dictionary from 1873, and an 1879 article on Japanese cookery in the journal ""Notes and Queries"".<br/>",9,When was the Muromachi period of Japan?,,

The word ""chocolate"" entered the English language from Spanish.<br/>2. How the word came into Spanish is less certain, and there are competing explanations.<br/>3. Perhaps the most cited explanation is that ""chocolate"" comes from Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, from the word ""chocolātl"", which many sources derived from ""xocolātl"" , from ""xococ"" 'sour' or 'bitter', and ""ātl"" 'water' or 'drink'.<br/>4. However, as William Bright noted, the word ""chocolatl"" does not occur in central Mexican colonial sources, making this an unlikely derivation.<br/>5. Santamaria gives a derivation from the Yucatec Maya word ""chokol"" meaning 'hot', and the Nahuatl ""atl"" meaning 'water'.<br/>6. Sophie and Michael D. Coe agree with this etymology.Pointing to various sources dating from the time of the Spanish conquest, they identify ""cacahuatl"" (""cacao water"") as the original Nahuatl word for the cold beverage consumed by the Aztecs.<br/>7. Noting that using a word with ""caca"" in it to describe a thick brown beverage would not have gone over well with most speakers of Spanish because ""caca"" means 'faeces' in Spanish, the Coes suggest that the Spanish colonisers combined the Nahuatl ""atl"" with the Yucatec Maya ""chocol"", for, unlike the Aztec, the Maya tended to drink chocolate heated.<br/>8. The Spanish preferred the warm Mayan preparation of the beverage to the cold Aztec one, and so the colonisers substituted ""chocol"" in place of the culturally unacceptable ""caca"".More recently, Dakin and Wichmann derive it from another Nahuatl term, ""chicolatl"" from eastern Nahuatl, meaning ""beaten drink"".<br/>9. They derive this term from the word for the frothing stick, ""chicoli"".<br/>10. However, the Coes write that ""xicalli"" referred to the gourd out of which the beverage was consumed and that the use of a frothing stick (known as a ""molinillo"") was a product of creolisation between the Spanish and Aztec; the original frothing method used by the indigenous people was simply pouring the drink from a height into another vessel.<br/>",1,"Where did the word ""chocolate"" in English come from?",,

Saudi Arabia supports the intended formation of the Arab Customs Union in 2015 and an Arab common market by 2020, as announced at the 2009 Arab League summit.<br/>4. As a founding member of OPEC, its oil pricing policy has been generally to stabilize the world oil market and try to moderate sharp price movements so as to not jeopardise the Western economies.Between the mid-1970s and 2002 Saudi Arabia expended over $70 billion in ""overseas development aid"".<br/>5. However, there is evidence that the vast majority was, in fact, spent on propagating and extending the influence of Wahhabism at the expense of other forms of Islam.<br/>6. There has been an intense debate over whether Saudi aid and Wahhabism has fomented extremism in recipient countries.<br/>7. The two main allegations are that, by its nature, Wahhabism encourages intolerance and promotes terrorism.<br/>8. Former CIA director James Woolsey described it as ""the soil in which Al-Qaeda and its sister terrorist organizations are flourishing.""<br/>9. However, the Saudi government strenuously denies these claims or that it exports religious or cultural extremism.In the Arab and Muslim worlds, Saudi Arabia is considered to be pro-Western and pro-American, and it is certainly a long-term ally of the United States.<br/>10. However, this and Saudi Arabia's role in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, particularly the stationing of U.S. troops on Saudi soil from 1991, prompted the development of a hostile Islamist response internally.<br/>11. As a result, Saudi Arabia has, to some extent, distanced itself from the U.S. and, for example, refused to support or to participate in the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.<br/>12. Relations with the United States became strained following 9/11.<br/>13. American politicians and media accused the Saudi government of supporting terrorism and tolerating a ""jihadist"" culture.<br/>14. Indeed, Osama bin Laden and fifteen out of the nineteen 9/11 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia.<br/>15. According to the former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, ""Saudi Arabia remains a critical financial support base for al-Qaida, the Taliban, LeT and other terrorist groups... Donors in Saudi Arabia constitute the most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide.<br/>16. ""Saudi Arabia's increasing alarm at the rise of Iran is reflected in the reported private comments of King Abdullah urging the US to attack Iran and ""cut off the head of the snake"".<br/>17. The tentative rapprochement between the US and Iran that began in secret in 2011 was said to be feared by the Saudis, and, during the run up to the widely welcomed deal on Iran's nuclear programme that capped the first stage of US–Iranian détente, Robert Jordan, who was U.S. ambassador to Riyadh from 2001 to 2003, said ""Saudis' worst nightmare would be the [Obama administration striking a grand bargain with Iran.""<br/>18. Saudi Arabia has been seen as a moderating influence in the Arab-Israeli conflict, periodically putting forward a peace plan between Israel and the Palestinians and condemning Hezbollah.<br/>19. Following the Arab Spring Saudi Arabia offered asylum to deposed President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia and King Abdullah telephoned President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt (prior to his deposition) to offer his support.<br/>",10,Why was a hostile Islamist response developed internally?,,

Hellenistic and Roman periods (323 BC–4th century AD).After a period of confusion following Alexander's death, the Antigonid dynasty, descended from one of Alexander's generals, established its control over Macedon by 276 BC, as well as hegemony over most of the Greek city-states.<br/>2. From about 200 BC the Roman Republic became increasingly involved in Greek affairs and engaged in a series of wars with Macedon.<br/>3. Macedon's defeat at the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC signaled the end of Antigonid power in Greece.<br/>4. In 146 BC Macedonia was annexed as a province by Rome, and the rest of Greece became a Roman protectorate.The process was completed in 27 BC when the Roman Emperor Augustus annexed the rest of Greece and constituted it as the senatorial province of Achaea.<br/>5. Despite their military superiority, the Romans admired and became heavily influenced by the achievements of Greek culture, hence Horace's famous statement: ""Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit"" (""Greece, although captured, took its wild conqueror captive"").<br/>6. Greek science, technology and mathematics are generally considered to have reached their peak during the Hellenistic period.Greek-speaking communities of the Hellenized East were instrumental in the spread of early Christianity in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, and Christianity's early leaders and writers (notably St Paul) were generally Greek-speaking, though none were from Greece.<br/>7. Greece itself had a tendency to cling on to paganism and was not one of the influential centers of early Christianity: in fact, some ancient Greek religious practices remained in vogue until the end of the 4th century, with some areas such as the southeastern Peloponnese remaining pagan until well into the 10th century AD.<br/>",4,When was Macedonia annexed as a province by Rome?,,

Peru is a multiethnic country formed by different groups over five centuries.<br/>2. Amerindians inhabited Peruvian territory for several millennia before the Spanish Conquest of the 16th century; according to historian Noble David Cook their population decreased from nearly 5–9 million in the 1520s to around 600,000 in 1620 mainly because of infectious diseases.<br/>3. Spaniards and Africans arrived in large numbers under colonial rule, mixing widely with each other and indigenous peoples.<br/>4. Gradual European immigration from Italy, Spain, France, Britain, and Germany followed independence.<br/>5. Peru freed its black slaves in 1854.<br/>6. Chinese arrived in the 1850s, replacing slave workers, and have since greatly influenced Peruvian society.The last Peruvian census that attempted to classify persons according to ethnicity was in 1940, when 53% of the population was found to be white or mestizo (mixed white and Amerindian ancestry) and 46% was found to be Amerindian.<br/>7. According to the CIA World Factbook, the majority of the people in Peru are Amerindians, mostly Quechua and Aymara, followed by mestizos.<br/>8. Yet, in a 2006 survey from the ""Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática"" (INEI), the Peruvian population self-identified primarily as mestizo (59.5%), followed by Quechua (22.7%), Aymara (2.7%), Amazonian (1.8%), Black/Mulatto (1.6%), white (4.9%), and ""Others"" (6.7%).With about 29.5 million inhabitants, Peru is the fifth most populous country in South America.<br/>9. Its demographic growth rate declined from 2.6% to 1.6% between 1950 and 2000; population is expected to reach approximately 42 million in 2050.<br/>10. As of 2007, 75.9% lived in urban areas and 24.1% in rural areas.<br/>11. Major cities include Lima (home to over 8 million people), Arequipa, Trujillo, Chiclayo, Piura, Iquitos, Cusco, Chimbote, and Huancayo; all reported more than 250,000 inhabitants in the 2007 census.<br/>12. There are 15 uncontacted Amerindian tribes in Peru.Spanish, the first language of 83.9% of Peruvians aged five and older in 2007, is the primary language of the country.<br/>13. It coexists with several indigenous languages, the most common of which is Quechua, spoken by 13.2% of the population.<br/>14. Other native and foreign languages were spoken at that time by 2.7% and 0.1% of Peruvians, respectively.In the 2007 census, 81.3% of the population over 12 years old described themselves as Catholic, 12.5% as Evangelical, 3.3% as of other denominations, and 2.9% as non-religious.<br/>15.

The key to the offense is to accurately pass (or ""set"") the ball into the center forward or hole set, positioned directly in front of the goal (""the hole"").<br/>2. Any field player may throw the hole set a ""wet pass.""<br/>3. A wet pass is one that hits the water just outside of the hole set's reach.<br/>4. A dry pass may also be used.<br/>5. This is where the hole set receives the ball directly in his hand and then attempts a shot at the cage.<br/>6. This pass is much more difficult because if the pass is not properly caught, the officials will be likely to call an offensive foul resulting in a change of ball possession.<br/>7. The hole set attempts to take possession of the ball a wet pass, to shoot at the goal, or to draw a foul from his defender.<br/>8. A minor foul is called if his defender (called the ""hole D"") attempts to impede movement before the hole set has possession.<br/>9. The referee indicates the foul with one short whistle blow and points one hand to the spot of the foul and the other hand in the direction of the attack of the team to whom the free throw has been awarded.<br/>10. The hole set then has a ""reasonable amount of time"" (typically about three seconds) to re-commence play by making a free pass to one of the other players.<br/>11. The defensive team cannot hinder the hole set until the free throw has been taken, but the hole set cannot shoot a goal once the foul has been awarded until the ball has been played by at least one other player.<br/>12. If the hole set attempts a goal without the free throw, the goal is not counted and the defense takes possession of the ball, unless the shot is made outside the 5-meter line.<br/>13. As soon as the hole set has a free pass, the other attacking players attempt to swim (or ""drive"") away from their defenders towards the goal.<br/>14. The players at the flat position will attempt to set a screen (also known as a pick) for the driver.<br/>15.

""Part of Me"" is a power pop song set to a house beat.<br/>3. It is composed in the key of D minor and set in a 4/4 time signature at a tempo of 130 beats per minute.<br/>4. The melody spans the tonal range of D4 to D5, while the music follows the chord progression of Dm–F–Bb-C. Production was done by Perry's frequent collaborator, Dr. Luke.<br/>5. The song begins with Perry's somber and emotional delivery of the line, ""Days like this I want to drive away/ Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade.""<br/>6. At the bridge, the beat amplifies and Perry's lyrics become more aggressive as she commands ""Now Look at Me!<br/>7. "", signalling to her ex that she is still strong, regardless of what he tries to do to bring her down.<br/>8. The beat reaches a peak at the chorus, and Perry's tone and the song's lyrics become more aggressive and prominent as she sings, ""This is the Part of me that you're never-ever gonna take away from me.""<br/>9. As the song continues, Perry's lyrics become strong and empowered: ""So you can keep the diamond ring/ It don't mean nothing anyway/ In fact you can keep everything Yeah/ Yeah Except for me"".<br/>10. Perry repeats the ending chorus as the beat fades.James Dinh of MTV noted that ""the pop star appears strong, bold and just a tad resentful after a breakup"" on the track.<br/>11. His analysis of the lyrics observed that ""The singer declares herself unbreakable after a breakup, evident in lines such as ""Days like this I want to drive away/ Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade/ 'Cause you chewed me up and spit me out/ Like I was poison in your mouth/ You took my light, you drained me down/ But that was then and this is now, now look at me.""<br/>12. Dinh pointed out similarities between ""Part of Me"" and Perry's previous single ""California Gurls"", noting that ""the tune's steady beat amplifies"" as the chorus starts.<br/>13. Andrew Hampp of ""Billboard"" described the song as a ""dance-floor rave up"", and compared the song's composition to Jessie J's ""Domino"".<br/>14. Edna Gundersen from"" USA Today"" stated: ""Katy Perry could be addressing her ex or her detractors on this defiant slapdown, a gleaming ""Firework""-like pop torpedo propelled by slick beats and a brazen chorus.""<br/>15. Chris Ryan, also of MTV, inferred that the song was aimed at Perry's ex-boyfriend Travie McCoy, while ""New York"" magazine journalist Amanda Dobbis described it as ""another break-up anthem"".<br/>16. Fans and media noted differences in the lyrics between the demo and the single, and claimed that the changes redirected the song's subject from McCoy to Perry's ex-husband Russell Brand, from whom she had recently divorced.<br/>17. Perry declared it was not about Brand, stating:I wrote it two years ago, which is funny because everybody is like ""God, it sounds so current,"" and some people that I work with were like ""You should just say you wrote it a couple of weeks ago.""<br/>18.

The team with the greater score is then said to have ""won by an innings and ""n"" runs"", and does not need to bat again: ""n"" is the difference between the two teams' aggregate scores.If the team batting last is all out, and both sides have scored the same number of runs, then the match is a tie; this result is quite rare in matches of two innings a side.<br/>5. In the traditional form of the game, if the time allotted for the match expires before either side can win, then the game is declared a draw.If the match has only a single innings per side, then a maximum number of deliveries for each innings is often imposed.<br/>6. Such a match is called a ""limited overs"" or ""one-day"" match, and the side scoring more runs wins regardless of the number of wickets lost, so that a draw cannot occur.<br/>7. If this kind of match is temporarily interrupted by bad weather, then a complex mathematical formula, known as the Duckworth-Lewis method after its developers, is often used to recalculate a new target score.<br/>8. A one-day match can also be declared a ""no-result"" if fewer than a previously agreed number of overs have been bowled by either team, in circumstances that make normal resumption of play impossible; for example, wet weather.<br/>",5,What happens if the time allotted expires before either side can win?,,

Stereotactic radiation is a specialized type of external beam radiation therapy.<br/>2. It uses focused radiation beams targeting a well-defined tumor using extremely detailed imaging scans.<br/>3. Radiation oncologists perform stereotactic treatments, often with the help of a neurosurgeon for tumors in the brain or spine.There are two types of stereotactic radiation.<br/>4. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is when doctors use a single or several stereotactic radiation treatments of the brain or spine.<br/>5. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) refers to one or several stereotactic radiation treatments with the body, such as the lungs.Some doctors say an advantage to stereotactic treatments are they deliver the right amount of radiation to the cancer in a shorter amount of time than traditional treatments, which can often take six to 11 weeks.<br/>6. Plus treatments are given with extreme accuracy, which should limit the effect of the radiation on healthy tissues.<br/>7. One problem with stereotactic treatments is that they are only suitable for certain small tumors.Stereotactic treatments can be confusing because many hospitals call the treatments by the name of the manufacturer rather than calling it SRS or SBRT.<br/>8.

Phase 2: Battle for Smolensk (3 July – 5 August 1941).On 3 July, Hitler finally gave the go-ahead for the Panzers to resume their drive east after the infantry divisions had caught up.<br/>2. However, a rainstorm typical of Russian summers slowed their progress and Russian defenses stiffened.<br/>3. The delays gave the Soviets time to organize a massive counterattack against Army Group Center.<br/>4. Its ultimate objective was Smolensk, which commanded the road to Moscow.<br/>5. Facing the Germans was an old Soviet defensive line held by six armies.<br/>6. On 6 July, the Soviets attacked the 3rd Panzer Army with 700 tanks.<br/>7. The Germans defeated this counterattack with overwhelming air superiority.<br/>8. The 2nd Panzer Army crossed the River Dnieper and closed on Smolensk from the south while the 3rd Panzer Army, after defeating the Soviet counterattack, closed on Smolensk from the north.<br/>9. Trapped between their pincers were three Soviet armies.<br/>10. On 18 July, the Panzer Groups came to within sixteen kilometres of closing the gap but the trap would not snap shut until 26 July.<br/>11. When the Panzer Groups finally closed the gap, 300,000 Red Army soldiers were captured; but liquidating the pocket took another ten days in which time 100,000 Red Army soldiers escaped to stand between the Germans and Moscow.Four weeks into the campaign, the Germans realized they had grossly underestimated Soviet strength.<br/>12. The German troops had used their initial supplies without attaining the expected strategic freedom of movement.<br/>13. Operations were now slowed down to allow for resupply; the delay was to be used to adapt strategy to the new situation.<br/>14. Hitler had lost faith in encirclement as large numbers of Soviet soldiers had escaped the pincers.<br/>15. Hitler now believed he could defeat the Soviets by economic damage, depriving them of the industrial capacity to continue the war.<br/>16. That meant seizing the industrial center of Kharkov, the Donets Basin and the oil fields of the Caucasus in the south and the speedy capture of Leningrad, a major center of military production, in the north.<br/>17. He also wanted to link up with the Finns to the north.Fedor von Bock and almost all the German generals involved in Operation ""Barbarossa"", vehemently argued in favor of continuing the all-out drive toward Moscow.<br/>18. Besides the psychological importance of capturing the enemy's capital, the generals pointed out that Moscow was a major center of arms production and the center of the Soviet communications and transportation system.<br/>19. More importantly, intelligence reports indicated that the bulk of the Red Army was deployed near Moscow under Semyon Timoshenko for an all-out defense of the capital.<br/>20. But Hitler was adamant, and issued a direct order to Heinz Guderian, bypassing his commanding officer von Bock, to send Army Group Centre's tanks to the north and south, temporarily halting the drive to Moscow.<br/>",6,On what date did the Soviets attack the 3rd Panzer Army with 700 tanks?,,

After the poor commercial performance of their debut album, ""Aim and Ignite"", Fun decided to put Jeff Bhasker as producer for their second studio effort.<br/>2. The band's frontman, Nate Ruess, met with Bhasker at his hotel in New York City in February 2011.<br/>3. Ruess was anxious about meeting Bhasker, so he arrived early at the bar in the Bowery Hotel on the Lower East Side ""and had a little to drink just to make sure I was loosened up.""<br/>4. According to Bhasker, he wasn't really wanting to meet the band, as he ""was working with Beyoncé, and also with Alicia, Kanye and Jay-Z, and doing this had been a big goal in my life.<br/>5. I had no intention of being distracted.<br/>6. ""Bhasker had just finished a long day in the studio with Beyoncé, and had decided to give Ruess 10 minutes.<br/>7. He had previously already canceled two meetings with him.<br/>8. The two began talking about music, and Ruess' desire to merge hip-hop beats and electronic effects with pop rock intrigued Bhasker, who invited Ruess up to his hotel room to show him some Beyoncé tracks he had been working on.<br/>9. ""Slightly tipsy and feeling inspired,"" Ruess belted out the chorus for ""We Are Young,"" which at that time was an unfinished composition.<br/>10. Bhasker was taken aback and automatically ""freaked out,"" demanding he see the band for studio time ""in the next few days.""<br/>11. The next day, Bhasker and Ruess booked a New York studio and cut a version of ""We Are Young"" not far from the final version of the track.On the first day of recording at Jungle City, Bhasker programmed the drums on his Akai MPC3000 machine, a moog bass and ""maybe using my little Juno 106, and we added vocals and piano.<br/>12. We worked for many more days on it afterwards, but the core of the final version of the song was recorded on that first day.” After the Jungle City sessions, more vocal, guitar and piano tracks were recorded at Electric Ladyland Studios, and from there sessions continued at Enormous Studios in Los Angeles, The Village Recorder to track the children's choir, and Abbey Road Studios to record the orchestral arrangements.<br/>13. The band invited Janelle Monáe to provide guest vocals on ""We Are Young"" through her friendship with Bhasker.<br/>14. After being played the song, Monáe was enthused about the song and recorded her vocals in Bristol, England.<br/>15. Bhasker further mixed the song in a 44.1 kHz/24-bit Pro Tools HD session at the course of almost two weeks, and the stereo mix was mastered using a L2 limiter and an API 550 EQ.When Bhasker multitracked Ruess' vocals for the chorus, he noticed that it ""had a Queen/Freddie Mercury vibe to it.""<br/>16. Guitarist Jack Antonoff called ""We Are Young"" the ""bull's-eye center"" of the sound the band was striving for while producing ""Some Nights.""<br/>17. The song displays the influences brought by Jeff Bhasker and hip-hop music.<br/>18. Antonoff agreed with the notion that the song was their de facto anthem: ""It's pretty rare, because any other projects that we've done, I don't think any of us have ever had that song that was like, 'This is our band,'"" Antonoff said.<br/>19. ""We're proud to say, 'Listen to this one song, and then come listen to the rest.<br/>20.

In everyday, grocery-store, culinary language, the words ""fruit"" and ""vegetable"" are mutually exclusive ; plant products that are called fruit are hardly ever classified as vegetables, and vice-versa.</br>7. The word ""fruit"" has a precise botanical meaning (a part that developed from the ovary of a flowering plant), which is considerably different from its culinary meaning, and includes many poisonous fruits.<br/>8. While peaches, plums, and oranges are ""fruit"" in both senses, many items commonly called ""vegetables"" — such as eggplants, bell peppers, and tomatoes — are botanically fruits, while the cereals (grains) are both a fruit and a vegetable, as well as some spices like black pepper and chili peppers.The question of whether the tomato is a fruit or a vegetable found its way into the United States Supreme Court in 1893.<br/>9. The court ruled unanimously in ""Nix v. Hedden"" that a tomato is correctly identified as, and thus taxed as, a vegetable, for the purposes of the Tariff of 1883 on imported produce.<br/>10. The court did acknowledge, however, that, botanically speaking, a tomato is a fruit.Languages other than English often have categories that can be identified with the common English meanings of ""fruit"" and ""vegetable"", but their precise meaning often depends on local culinary traditions.<br/>11. For example, in Brazil the avocado is traditionally consumed with sugar as a dessert or in milkshakes, and hence it is regarded as a culinary fruit; whereas in other countries (including Mexico and the United States) it is used in salads and dips, and hence considered to be a vegetable.<br/>",9,Which Supreme Court case ruled that tomatoes are vegetables?,,

Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)""Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)"" is a song by American recording artist Kelly Clarkson and the titular song from her fifth studio album, ""Stronger"" (2011).<br/>2. Originally titled as ""What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger)"", the song served as the album's second single on January 17, 2012 through RCA Records.<br/>3. Written by Jörgen Elofsson, Ali Tamposi, and David Gamson, with additional writing and production by Greg Kurstin, ""Stronger"" is an uptempo song which draws from the genres of pop rock, dance-pop, and electropop.<br/>4. Its lyrical content mainly explores themes of empowerment and recovery following a heartbreak, with the chorus inspired by a Friedrich Nietzsche quotation: ""That which does not kill us makes us stronger.<br/>5. ""Upon its release, ""Stronger"" was met with positive reviews from music critics, who considered it to be the musical highlight of ""Stronger"".<br/>6. Clarkson's vocal performance and song's production received particular praise, while criticism targeted the song's lyrical content.<br/>7. Commercially, ""Stronger"" became her most successful single to date.<br/>8. In the United States, it became her third song to top the ""Billboard"" Hot 100 chart for three non-consecutive weeks, surpassing ""A Moment Like This"" (2002) and ""My Life Would Suck Without You"" (2009) as her longest-running number one single on the chart.<br/>9. It also topped fifteen other ""Billboard"" charts, including Adult Pop Songs, Adult Contemporary, Hot Dance Club Songs, and Pop Songs charts, more than any other song Clarkson has ever released.<br/>10. Internationally, ""Stronger"" topped the national charts of Poland and Slovakia and attained a top-ten position in over fifteen countries around the world, eventually selling over five million copies worldwide, becoming one of the best-selling singles of all time.<br/>11. Its success helped its parent album to sustain commercial longevity for over a year.<br/>12. ""Stronger"" merited consideration for several industry awards—including three Grammy Award nominations, and a World Music Award nomination.The song's accompanying music video was filmed by Shane Drake, which incorporates the theme of a global flash mob dance, featuring submitted videos of people dancing to the song.<br/>13. The music video garnered positive reception from critics who felt that its overall impact was exuberant.<br/>14. It earned Clarkson a nomination for a MuchMusic Video Award.<br/>15. With its continued success, she performed ""Stronger"" on several live award shows and television appearances around the world, debuting it during the first season of the ""The X Factor"" (U.S.) and performing it on the 37th season of ""Saturday Night Live"", the 2012 MuchMusic Video Awards, and the 2012 American Music Awards.<br/>16. Clarkson also included the song in the set list of her Stronger Tour and on the encore set of her 2012 Summer Tour with The Fray.<br/>",1,Who sings Stronger?,,

According to the director Haifaa al-Mansour, it took five years to make ""Wadjda"".<br/>2. Most of the time was spent trying to find financial backing and getting filming permission, since she insisted on filming in Saudi Arabia for reasons of authenticity.<br/>3. She received backing from Rotana, the film production company of Prince Alwaleed bin Talal.<br/>4. However, she was very interested in finding a foreign co-producer because ""in Saudi there are no movie theatres, there is no film industry to speak of and, therefore, little money for investment"".<br/>5. After being chosen for a Sundance Institute writer's lab in Jordan, al-Mansour got in touch with the German production company Razor Film, which had previously produced films with Middle-Eastern topics (""Paradise Now"" and ""Waltz with Bashir"").<br/>6. The production involved co-operation with two German public TV broadcasters, Norddeutscher Rundfunk and Bayerischer Rundfunk.<br/>7. Additional funding came from (FFA, Berlin); Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg GmbH (MBB, Potsdam); Mitteldeutsche Medienförderung GmbH (MDM, Leipzig) and Filmfonds Babelsberg (ILB, Potsdam-Babelsberg).Al-Mansour's screenplay was influenced by neorealist cinema like Vittorio de Sica's ""Bicycle Thieves"", Jafar Panahi's ""Offside"" or ""Rosetta"".<br/>8. The final scene recalls the final scene of François Truffaut 's The 400 Blows.<br/>9. Al-Mansour says that the original version of her screenplay was much bleaker than the finished product: ""I decided I didn't want the film to carry a slogan and scream, but just to create a story where people can laugh and cry a little.""<br/>10. Al-Mansour based the character of Wadjda on one of her nieces and also on her own experiences when growing up.<br/>11. The main themes of the story are freedom, as represented by the bicycle, and the fear of emotional abandonment, as Wadjda's father wants to take a second wife who will provide him with a son.<br/>12. ""Wadjda"" was filmed on the streets of Riyadh, which often made it necessary for the director to work from the back of a van, as she could not publicly mix with the men in the crew.<br/>13. Often, she could only communicate via walkie-talkie and had to watch the actors on a monitor.<br/>14. This made it difficult to direct: ""It made me realise the need to rehearse and to develop an understanding for each scene before we shot it.""<br/>15.

Rembrandt produced etchings for most of his career, from 1626 to 1660, when he was forced to sell his printing-press and virtually abandoned etching.<br/>2. Only the troubled year of 1649 produced no dated work.<br/>3. He took easily to etching and, though he also learned to use a burin and partly engraved many plates, the freedom of etching technique was fundamental to his work.<br/>4. He was very closely involved in the whole process of printmaking, and must have printed at least early examples of his etchings himself.<br/>5. At first he used a style based on drawing, but soon moved to one based on painting, using a mass of lines and numerous bitings with the acid to achieve different strengths of line.<br/>6. Towards the end of the 1630s, he reacted against this manner and moved to a simpler style, with fewer bitings.<br/>7. He worked on the so-called ""Hundred Guilder Print"" in stages throughout the 1640s, and it was the ""critical work in the middle of his career"", from which his final etching style began to emerge.Although the print only survives in two states, the first very rare, evidence of much reworking can be seen underneath the final print and many drawings survive for elements of it.In the mature works of the 1650s, Rembrandt was more ready to improvise on the plate and large prints typically survive in several states, up to eleven, often radically changed.<br/>8. He now uses hatching to create his dark areas, which often take up much of the plate.<br/>9. He also experimented with the effects of printing on different kinds of paper, including Japanese paper, which he used frequently, and on vellum.<br/>10. He began to use ""surface tone,"" leaving a thin film of ink on parts of the plate instead of wiping it completely clean to print each impression.<br/>11. He made more use of drypoint, exploiting, especially in landscapes, the rich fuzzy burr that this technique gives to the first few impressions.His prints have similar subjects to his paintings, although the twenty-seven self-portraits are relatively more common, and portraits of other people less so.<br/>12. There are forty-six landscapes, mostly small, which largely set the course for the graphic treatment of landscape until the end of the 19th century.<br/>13. One third of his etchings are of religious subjects, many treated with a homely simplicity, whilst others are his most monumental prints.<br/>14. A few erotic, or just obscene, compositions have no equivalent in his paintings.<br/>15. He owned, until forced to sell it, a magnificent collection of prints by other artists, and many borrowings and influences in his work can be traced to artists as diverse as Mantegna, Raphael, Hercules Segers, and Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione.<br/>",1,When did Rembrandt produce etchings?,,

The earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern digital computer.<br/>2. Machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks such as the abacus have existed since antiquity, aiding in computations such as multiplication and division.Blaise Pascal designed and constructed the first working mechanical calculator, Pascal's calculator, in 1642.<br/>3. In 1673 Gottfried Leibniz demonstrated a digital mechanical calculator, called the 'Stepped Reckoner'.<br/>4. He may be considered the first computer scientist and information theorist, for, among other reasons documenting the binary number system.<br/>5. In 1820, Thomas de Colmar launched the mechanical calculator industry when he released his simplified arithmometer, which was the first calculating machine strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment.<br/>6. Charles Babbage started the design of the first ""automatic mechanical calculator"", his difference engine, in 1822, which eventually gave him the idea of the first ""programmable mechanical calculator"", his Analytical Engine.<br/>7. He started developing this machine in 1834 and ""in less than two years he had sketched out many of the salient features of the modern computer.<br/>8. A crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system derived from the Jacquard loom"" making it infinitely programmable.<br/>9. In 1843, during the translation of a French article on the ""analytical engine"", Ada Lovelace wrote, in one of the many notes she included, an algorithm to compute the Bernoulli numbers, which is considered to be the first computer program.<br/>10. Around 1885, Herman Hollerith invented the tabulator which used punched cards to process statistical information; eventually his company became part of IBM.<br/>11. In 1937, one hundred years after Babbage's impossible dream, Howard Aiken convinced IBM, which was making all kinds of punched card equipment and was also in the calculator business to develop his giant programmable calculator, the ASCC/Harvard Mark I, based on Babbage's ""analytical engine"", which itself used cards and a central computing unit.<br/>12. When the machine was finished, some hailed it as ""Babbage's dream come true"".During the 1940s, as new and more powerful computing machines were developed, the term ""computer"" came to refer to the machines rather than their human predecessors.<br/>13. As it became clear that computers could be used for more than just mathematical calculations, the field of computer science broadened to study computation in general.<br/>14. Computer science began to be established as a distinct academic discipline in the 1950s and early 1960s.<br/>15. The world's first computer science degree program, the Cambridge Diploma in Computer Science, began at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory in 1953.<br/>16. The first computer science degree program in the United States was formed at Purdue University in 1962.<br/>17. Since practical computers became available, many applications of computing have become distinct areas of study in their own right.Although many initially believed it was impossible that computers themselves could actually be a scientific field of study, in the late fifties it gradually became accepted among the greater academic population.<br/>18. It is the now well-known IBM brand that formed part of the computer science revolution during this time.<br/>19. IBM (short for International Business Machines) released the IBM 704 and later the IBM 709 computers, which were widely used during the exploration period of such devices.<br/>20. ""Still, working with the IBM was frustrating...if you had misplaced as much as one letter in one instruction, the program would crash, and you would have to start the whole process over again"".<br/>21. During the late 1950s, the computer science discipline was very much in its developmental stages, and such issues were commonplace.Time has seen significant improvements in the usability and effectiveness of computing technology.<br/>22. Modern society has seen a significant shift in the users of computer technology, from usage only by experts and professionals, to a near-ubiquitous user base.<br/>23. Initially, computers were quite costly, and some degree of human aid was needed for efficient use - in part from professional computer operators.<br/>24. As computer adoption became more widespread and affordable, less human assistance was needed for common usage.<br/>",2,When was the first calculator made?,,

Next to join the series was Alan Tudyk in the role of Noah Werner, George's college buddy and a dentist who moved to the suburbs some years earlier.<br/>6. Allie Grant then joined the series as Lisa Shay, a socially awkward girl at school who befriends Tessa.<br/>7. Jeremy Sisto and Carly Chaikin followed with Sisto playing George Altman, Tessa's architect father who moves her from Manhattan to the suburbs, and Chaikin playing Dalia Royce, Tessa's neighbor who quickly becomes her nemesis at school.<br/>8. Cheryl Hines was next cast in the role of Dallas Royce, a well-to-do housewife and the mother of Dalia.<br/>9. She tells George that her absentee husband (Jay Mohr) ""travels a lot"".<br/>10. Rex Lee was the last actor cast, playing Mr. Wolfe, Tessa's clueless high school guidance counselor.<br/>11. He was originally a guest star but was upped to a series regular after the pilot.<br/>12. ""Saturday Night Live"" (""SNL"") alumna Ana Gasteyer plays the Altmans' domineering neighbor, Sheila Shay, whom they vainly try to avoid.<br/>13.

The song was written by Jepsen and Tavish Crowe as a folk song, but its genre was modified to pop following the production by Josh Ramsay.<br/>3. It was released as the lead single from the EP on September 20, 2011, through 604 Records.<br/>4. Jepsen was signed to Schoolboy Records, releasing her single in the United States through the label, as the first single from ""Kiss"".<br/>5. Musically, ""Call Me Maybe"" is an upbeat teen pop track that draws influences from dance-pop and disco.<br/>6. Lyrically, the track alludes to the inconvenience that a love at first sight brings to a girl who hopes for a call back from a crush.The song received generally positive reviews from contemporary critics, who praised its composition and clever lyrical content .<br/>7. ""Call Me Maybe"" has attained commercial success worldwide, reaching number one in Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Poland, Slovakia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States, while peaking inside the top three in Austria, Belgium (Flanders & Wallonia), Germany, Israel, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden.<br/>8. After reaching the top position on the Canadian Hot 100, Jepsen became only the fifth Canadian artist to do so in her home country since 2007.<br/>9. In the United States, the track reached number one on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100 and the Pop Songs chart.<br/>10. The song is the first number one by a Canadian female artist on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100 chart since 2007's ""Girlfriend"" by Avril Lavigne.An accompanying music video was directed by Ben Knechtel.<br/>11. In it, Jepsen seeks the attention of an attractive boy next door who is revealed at the close of the story to be attracted to a male band member.<br/>12. As part of promotion for the song, Jepsen performed the track on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"", where she made her US television debut, and at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards.<br/>13. ""Call Me Maybe"" has been covered by several artists, including Katy Perry, Kelly Clarkson, Miranda Cosgrove, Dan Deacon, Fun, Big Time Rush, The Chipettes, R5, Lil' Wayne, Enter Shikari, Ben Howard, Cody Simpson, The Saturdays, and parodied by Cookie Monster and some of the news staff of National Public Radio.<br/>14. It was also covered on ""The New Rachel"", the season premiere episode of the fourth season of ""Glee"".<br/>15. ""Call Me Maybe"" was nominated for two Grammy Awards, for Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance at the 55th Annual ceremony, but lost to ""We Are Young"" by Fun and the live performance of ""Set Fire to the Rain"" by Adele, respectively.<br/>16. On December 11, 2012, ""Call Me Maybe"" was named ""Song of the Year"" for 2012 by MTV.<br/>17.

The connection between the break-in and the re-election committee was highlighted by media coverage — in particular, investigative coverage by ""The Washington Post"", ""Time"", and ""The New York Times"".<br/>2. The coverage dramatically increased publicity and consequent political repercussions.<br/>3. Relying heavily upon anonymous sources, ""Post"" reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein uncovered information suggesting that knowledge of the break-in, and attempts to cover it up, led deeply into the Justice Department, the FBI, the CIA, and the White House.Chief among the ""Post's"" anonymous sources was an individual whom Woodward and Bernstein had nicknamed Deep Throat; 33 years later, in 2005, he was confirmed to be William Mark Felt, Sr., the former deputy director of the FBI.<br/>4. Felt met secretly with Woodward, telling him of Howard Hunt’s involvement with the Watergate break-in, and that the White House staff regarded the stakes in Watergate extremely high.<br/>5. Felt warned Woodward that the FBI wanted to know where he and other reporters were getting their information, as they were uncovering a wider web of crimes than first disclosed.<br/>6. In one of their last meetings, all of which took place at an underground parking garage somewhere in Rosslyn, Virginia at 2:00 am, Felt cautioned Woodward that he might be followed and not to trust their phone conversations to be secure.<br/>7. Felt also planted leaks about Watergate to ""Time"" magazine, the ""Washington Daily News"" and other publications.<br/>8. ""'During this early period, most of the media failed to grasp the full implications of the scandal, and concentrated reporting on other topics related to the 1972 presidential election.<br/>9. After the revelation that one of the convicted burglars wrote to Judge Sirica alleging a high-level coverup, the media shifted its focus.<br/>10. ""Time"" magazine described Nixon as undergoing ""daily hell and very little trust"".<br/>11. The distrust between the press and the Nixon administration was mutual and greater than usual due to lingering dissatisfaction with events from the Vietnam War.<br/>12. Public distrust of the media reached over 40%.Nixon and top administration officials discussed using government agencies to ""get"" what they perceived as hostile media organizations.<br/>13. The discussions had precedent.<br/>14. At the request of Nixon's White House in 1969, the FBI tapped the phones of five reporters.<br/>15. In 1971, the White House requested an audit of the tax return of the editor of ""Newsday"", after he wrote a series of articles about the financial dealings of a friend of the President's.The administration and its supporters accused the media of making ""wild accusations"", putting too much emphasis on the story, and of having a liberal bias against the Administration.<br/>16. Nixon said in a May 1974 interview with a supporter that if he had followed the liberal policies that he thought the media preferred, ""Watergate would have been a blip.""<br/>17. The media noted that most of the reporting turned out to be accurate and the competitive nature of the media guaranteed massive coverage of the political scandal.<br/>18.

Set in 1961, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" was inspired by the cultural disconnection within a New York–based music scene where the songs seemed to come from all parts of the United States except New York, but whose performers included Brooklyn-born Dave Van Ronk and Ramblin' Jack Elliott.<br/>2. Well before writing the script, the Coens began with a single premise: suppose Van Ronk got beat up outside of Gerde's Folk City in the Village.<br/>3. The filmmakers employed that idea in the opening scenes, then periodically returned to the project over the next couple of years to expand the story around a fictional character.<br/>4. One source for the film was Van Ronk's posthumously published (2005) memoir, ""The Mayor of MacDougal Street.""<br/>5. According to the book's co-author, Elijah Wald, the Coens mined the work ""for local color and a few scenes.""<br/>6. The character is a composite of Van Ronk, Elliot, and other performers from the New York boroughs who performed in the Village at that time.<br/>7. Joel Coen remarked that ""the film doesn't really have a plot.<br/>8. That concerned us at one point; that's why we threw the cat in.<br/>9. ""Shooting was complicated by an early New York spring, which interfered with the bleak winter atmosphere that prevails throughout the film, and by the difficulty of filming several cats, who, unlike dogs, ignore the desires of filmmakers.<br/>10. On the advice of an animal trainer, the Coens put out a casting call for an orange tabby cat, which is sufficiently common that several cats would be available to play one part.<br/>11. Individual cats were then selected for each scene based on what they were predisposed to do on their own.Producer Scott Rudin, who worked with the Coens on ""True Grit"" and ""No Country for Old Men"", collaborated on the project.<br/>12. StudioCanal helped finance it without an American distributor in place.<br/>13. ""After shooting in New York City and elsewhere last year...the brothers finished the movie at their own pace"", wrote Michael Cieply in a January 2013 ""The New York Times"" interview with Joel Coen ahead of a private, pre-Grammys screening in Los Angeles.<br/>14.

Kennedy speech<br/><br/>1. A speech on the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. was given on April 4, 1968, by New York Senator Robert F. Kennedy (who was himself assassinated two months later).<br/>2. Kennedy was campaigning for the 1968 Democratic presidential nomination and had spoken at the University of Notre Dame and Ball State University earlier that day.<br/>3. Before boarding a plane to fly to Indianapolis for one last campaign speech in a predominantly black neighborhood of the city he learned that Martin Luther King had been shot, leading Kennedy press secretary Frank Mankiewicz to suggest that he ask the audience to pray for the King family and ask them to follow King's deeply held belief in non-violence.<br/>4. They did not learn that King was dead until they landed in Indianapolis.Both Mankiewicz and speechwriter Adam Walinsky drafted notes immediately before the rally for Kennedy's use, but Kennedy refused Walinsky's notes, instead using some that he had likely written on the ride over; Mankiewicz arrived after Kennedy had already begun to speak.<br/>5. Prior to arriving at the rally, the Chief of Police in Indianapolis told Kennedy that he could not provide protection and that giving the remarks would be too dangerous, but Kennedy decided to go ahead regardless.<br/>6. Standing on a podium mounted on a flatbed truck, Kennedy spoke for just four minutes and fifty-seven seconds.Robert F. Kennedy was the first to inform the audience of the death of Martin Luther King, causing some in the audience to scream and wail.<br/>7. Several of Kennedy's aides were even worried that the delivery of this information would result in a riot.<br/>8. Once the audience quieted down, Kennedy acknowledged that many in the audience would be filled with anger.<br/>9. But then Kennedy went on: ""For those of you who are black and are tempted to fill with -- be filled with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act, against all white people, I would only say that I can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling.<br/>10. I had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man.""<br/>11. These remarks surprised Kennedy aides, who had never heard him speak publicly of John F. Kennedy's death.<br/>12. Kennedy continued, saying that the country had to make an effort to ""go beyond these rather difficult times,"" and then quoted a poem by the Greek playwright Aeschylus, on the theme of the wisdom that comes, against one's will, from pain.<br/>13. To conclude, Kennedy said that the country needed and wanted unity between blacks and whites, asked the audience members to pray for the King family and the country, and once more quoted the ancient Greeks.The speech was credited in part with preventing post-assassination rioting in Indianapolis where it was given, though there were riots in many other parts of the country.<br/>14. It is widely considered one of the greatest speeches in American history.<br/>",2,What was Kennedy campaigning for at the time?,,

The Polish political determination to deploy forces directly at the German-Polish border, based on the Polish-British Common Defense Pact, shaped the country's defence plan, ""Plan West"".<br/>2. Poland's most valuable natural resources, industry and population were located along the western border in Eastern Upper Silesia.<br/>3. Polish policy centred on their protection especially since many politicians feared that if Poland were to retreat from the regions disputed by Germany, Britain and France would sign a separate peace treaty with Germany similar to the Munich Agreement of 1938.<br/>4. The fact that none of Poland's allies had specifically guaranteed Polish borders or territorial integrity certainly did not help in easing Polish concerns.<br/>5. For these reasons, Poland disregarded French advice to deploy the bulk of their forces behind the natural barriers such as the Vistula and San rivers, even though some Polish generals supported it as a better strategy.<br/>6. The West Plan did permit the Polish armies to retreat inside the country, but it was supposed to be a slow retreat behind prepared positions and was intended to give the armed forces time to complete its mobilization and execute a general counteroffensive with the support of the Western Allies.The Polish General Staff had not begun elaborating the ""West"" defence plan until 4 March 1939.<br/>7. It was assumed that the Polish Army, fighting in the initial phase of the war alone, would be compelled to defend the western regions of the country.<br/>8. The plan of operations took into account, first of all, the numerical and material superiority of the enemy and, consequently, assumed the defensive character of Polish operations.<br/>9. The Polish intentions were: the defence of the western regions judged as indispensable for waging the war, the taking advantage of the propitious conditions for counterblows by reserve units, the avoidance of being smashed before the beginning of Allied operations in the West and the making of decisions depending of the existing situation.<br/>10. The operational plan had not been elaborated in detail and concerned only the first stage of operations.The British and French estimated that Poland should be able to defend itself for two to three months, while Poland estimated it could do so for at least six months.<br/>11. Poland drafted its estimates based upon the expectation that the Western Allies honor their treaty obligations and quickly start an offensive of their own.<br/>12. In addition, the French and British expected the war to develop into trench warfare much like World War I.<br/>13. The Polish government was not notified of this strategy and based all of its defence plans on promises of quick relief by their Western allies.Polish forces were stretched thinly along the Polish-German border and lacked compact defence lines and good defence positions along disadvantageous terrain.<br/>14. This strategy also left supply lines poorly protected.<br/>15. One-third of Poland's forces were massed in or near the Polish Corridor, making them vulnerable to a double envelopment from East Prussia and the west.<br/>16. Another third were concentrated in the north-central part of the country, between the major cities of Łódź and Warsaw.<br/>17. The forward positioning of Polish forces vastly increased the difficulty of carrying out strategic maneuvers, compounded by inadequate mobility, as Polish units often lacked the ability to retreat from their defensive positions as they were being overrun by more mobile German mechanized formations.As the prospect of conflict increased, the British government pressed Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły to evacuate the most modern elements of the Polish Navy from the Baltic Sea.<br/>18. In the event of war the Polish military leaders realized that the ships which remained in the Baltic were likely to be quickly sunk by the Germans.<br/>19. Furthermore, the Danish straits were well within operating range of the German ""Kriegsmarine"" and ""Luftwaffe"", so there was little chance of an evacuation plan succeeding if implemented after hostilities began.<br/>20. Four days after the signing of the Polish-British Common Defense Pact, three destroyers of the Polish Navy executed the Peking Plan and consequently evacuated to Great Britain.Although the Polish military had prepared for conflict, the civilian population remained largely unprepared.<br/>21. Polish pre-war propaganda emphasized that any German invasion would be easily repelled.<br/>22. Consequently, Polish defeats during the German invasion came as a shock to the civilian population.<br/>23. Lacking training for such a disaster, the civilian population panicked and retreated east, spreading chaos, lowering troop morale and making road transportation for Polish troops very difficult.<br/>",15,How many Polish forces were in the Polish Corridor?,,

History.The periodic table and a natural number for each element.Loosely speaking, the existence or construction of a periodic table of elements creates an ordering of the elements, and so they can be numbered in order.Dmitri Mendeleev claimed that he arranged his first periodic tables in order of atomic weight (""Atomgewicht"").<br/>2. However, in consideration of the elements' observed chemical properties, he changed the order slightly and placed tellurium (atomic weight 127.6) ahead of iodine (atomic weight 126.9).<br/>3. This placement is consistent with the modern practice of ordering the elements by proton number, ""Z"", but that number was not known or suspected at the time.A simple numbering based on periodic table position was never entirely satisfactory, however.<br/>4. Besides the case of iodine and tellurium, later several other pairs of elements (such as argon and potassium, cobalt and nickel) were known to have nearly identical or reversed atomic weights, thus requiring their placement in the periodic table to be determined by their chemical properties.<br/>5. However the gradual identification of more and more chemically similar lanthanide elements, whoise atomic number was not obvious, led to inconsistency and uncertainty in the periodic numbering of elements at least from lutetium (element 71) onwards (hafnium was not known at this time).<br/>6.

The ""fyrd"" was composed of men who owned their own land, and were equipped by their community to fulfil the king's demands for military forces.<br/>3. For every five hides, or units of land nominally capable of supporting one household, one man was supposed to serve.<br/>4. It appears that the hundred was the main organising unit for the ""fyrd"".<br/>5. As a whole, England could furnish about 14,000 men for the ""fyrd"", when it was called out.<br/>6. The ""fyrd"" usually served for two months, except in emergencies.<br/>7. It was rare for the whole national ""fyrd"" to be called out; between 1046 and 1065 it was only done three times, in 1051, 1052, and 1065.<br/>8.

Thegns, the local landowning elites, fought either with the royal housecarls or attached themselves to the forces of an earl or other magnate.<br/>11. The ""fyrd"" and the housecarls both fought on foot, with the major difference between them being the housecarl's superior armour.<br/>12. The English army does not appear to have had a significant number of archers.Harold had spent mid-1066 on the south coast with a large army and fleet waiting for William to invade.<br/>13. The bulk of his forces were militia who needed to harvest their crops, so on 8 September Harold dismissed the militia and the fleet.<br/>14. Learning of the Norwegian invasion he rushed north, gathering forces as he went, and took the Norwegians by surprise, defeating them at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September.<br/>15. Harald of Norway and Tostig were killed, and the Norwegians suffered such great losses that only 24 of the original 300 ships were required to carry away the survivors.<br/>16.

While it neither declared war nor severed diplomatic relations, it was viewed by a number of senior U.S government and military officials as a very strong indicator that negotiations were likely to be terminated and that war might break out at any moment.<br/>8. A declaration of war was printed on the front page of Japan's newspapers in the evening edition of December 8, but not delivered to the U.S. government until the day after the attack.For decades, conventional wisdom held that Japan attacked without any official warning of a break in relations only because of accidents and bumbling that delayed the delivery of a document hinting at war to Washington.<br/>9. In 1999, however, Takeo Iguchi, a professor of law and international relations at International Christian University in Tokyo, discovered documents that pointed to a vigorous debate inside the government over how, and indeed whether, to notify Washington of Japan's intention to break off negotiations and start a war, including a December 7 entry in the war diary saying, ""our deceptive diplomacy is steadily proceeding toward success.""<br/>10. Of this, Iguchi said, ""The diary shows that the army and navy did not want to give any proper declaration of war, or indeed prior notice even of the termination of negotiations ... and they clearly prevailed.""<br/>",4,How was the message transmitted?,,

The residents of Storybrooke have lived an unchanging existence for 28 years, unaware of their own lack of aging.<br/>3. The town's only hope lies with a bail bonds-woman and bounty hunter named Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison), the daughter of Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Prince Charming (Josh Dallas), who was transported from the Enchanted Forest within the fairy tale world as an infant before she could be cursed.<br/>4. As such, she is the only person who can break the curse and restore the characters' lost memories.<br/>5. She is aided by her son, Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), with whom she has recently reunited after giving him up for adoption upon his birth, and his book of fairy tales which holds the key to ending the curse.<br/>6. Henry is also the adopted son of Regina, mayor of Storybrooke, who is actually Henry's step-great-grandmother, providing a source of both conflict and common interest between the two women.Episodes usually have one segment that details the characters' past lives, which when serialized, adds a piece to the puzzle about the characters and their connection to the events that preceded the curse and its consequences.<br/>7.

During the past century, astronomy has been revolutionized by the use of new methods for observing the universe.<br/>2. Astronomical observations were originally made using visible light.<br/>3. Galileo Galilei pioneered the use of telescopes to enhance these observations.<br/>4. However, visible light is only a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, and not all objects in the distant universe shine strongly in this particular band.<br/>5. More useful information may be found, for example, in radio wavelengths.<br/>6. Using radio telescopes, astronomers have found pulsars, quasars, and other extreme objects that push the limits of our understanding of physics.<br/>7. Observations in the microwave band have opened our eyes to the faint imprints of the Big Bang, a discovery Stephen Hawking called the ""greatest discovery of the century, if not all time"".<br/>8. Similar advances in observations using gamma rays, x-rays, ultraviolet light, and infrared light have also brought new insights to astronomy.<br/>9. As each of these regions of the spectrum has opened, new discoveries have been made that could not have been made otherwise.<br/>10. Astronomers hope that the same holds true of gravitational waves.Gravitational waves have two important and unique properties.<br/>11. First, there is no need for any type of matter to be present nearby in order for the waves to be generated by a binary system of uncharged black holes, which would emit no electromagnetic radiation.<br/>12. Second, gravitational waves can pass through any intervening matter without being scattered significantly.<br/>13. Whereas light from distant stars may be blocked out by interstellar dust, for example, gravitational waves will pass through essentially unimpeded.<br/>14. These two features allow gravitational waves to carry information about astronomical phenomena never before observed by humans.The sources of gravitational waves described above are in the low-frequency end of the gravitational-wave spectrum (10−7 to 105 Hz).<br/>15. An astrophysical source at the high-frequency end of the gravitational-wave spectrum (above 105 Hz and probably 1010 Hz) generates relic gravitational waves that are theorized to be faint imprints of the Big Bang like the cosmic microwave background (see gravitational wave background).<br/>16. At these high frequencies it is potentially possible that the sources may be ""man made"" that is, gravitational waves generated and detected in the laboratory.<br/>",2,How were observations originally made?,,

Production.Development.Alfonso Cuarón wrote the screenplay with his son Jonás.<br/>2. Cuarón told ""Wired"" magazine, ""I watched the Gregory Peck movie ""Marooned"" over and over as a kid.""<br/>3. That film is about the first crew of an experimental space station returning to Earth in an Apollo capsule that suffers a thruster malfunction.<br/>4. Cuarón attempted to develop his project at Universal Pictures, where it stayed in development for several years.<br/>5. After the rights to the project were sold, the project began development at Warner Bros, who acquired the project.<br/>6. In February 2010, it attracted the attention of Angelina Jolie, who had rejected a sequel to ""Wanted"".<br/>7. Later in the month, she rejected ""Wanted 2"", partially because the studio did not want to pay the fee she had received for her latest two movies and because she wanted to direct her Bosnian war film ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"".<br/>8. In March, Robert Downey, Jr. entered talks to be cast in the male lead role.In mid-2010, Marion Cotillard tested for the female lead role.<br/>9. By August 2010, Scarlett Johansson and Blake Lively were in the running for the role.<br/>10. In September, Cuarón received approval from Warner Bros. to offer the role without a screen test to Natalie Portman, who was being praised for her performance in the recently released ""Black Swan"".<br/>11. Portman rejected the project because of scheduling conflicts and Warner Bros. then approached Sandra Bullock for the role.<br/>12. In November 2010, Downey left the project to star in ""How to Talk to Girls""a project in development with Shawn Levy attached to direct.<br/>13. The following December, with Bullock signed for the co-lead role, George Clooney replaced Downey.The problem of shooting long scenes in a zero-g environment was a challenge.<br/>14. Eventually, the team decided to use computer-generated imagery for the spacewalk scenes and automotive robots to move Bullock's character for interior space station scenes.<br/>15. This meant that shots and blocking had to be planned well in advance for the robots to be programmed.<br/>16. It also made the production period much longer than expected.<br/>17. When the script was finished, Cuarón assumed it would take about a year to complete the film, but it took four and a half years.<br/>",1,Who wrote the film?,,

After nearly a century since the beginning of the movement, Mexican artists still produce murals and other forms of art with the same “mestizo” message.<br/>2. Murals can be found in government buildings, former churches and schools in nearly every part of the country.<br/>3. One recent example is a cross cultural project in 2009 to paint a mural in the municipal market of Teotitlán del Valle, a small town in the state of Oaxaca.<br/>4. High school and college student from Georgia, United States, collaborated with town authorities to design and paint a mural to promote nutrition, environmental protection, education and the preservation of Zapotec language and customs.Mexican muralism brought mural painting back to the forefront of Western art in the 20th century with its influence spreading abroad, especially promoting the idea of mural painting as a form of promoting social and political ideas.<br/>5. It offered an alternative to non-representational abstraction after World War I with figurative works that reflect society and its immediate concerns.<br/>6. While most Mexican muralists had little desire to be part of the international art scene, their influence spread to other parts of the Americas.<br/>7. Notable muralists influenced by Mexican muralism include Carlos Mérida of Guatemala, Oswaldo Guayasamín of Ecuador and Candido Portinari of Brazil .Rivera, Orozco, and Siqueiros all spent time in the United States.<br/>8. Orozco was the first to paint murals in the late 1920s at Pomona College in Claremont, California, staying until 1934 and becoming popular with academic institutions.<br/>9. During the Great Depression, the Works Progress Administration employed artists to paint murals, which paved the way for Mexican muralists to find commissions in the country.<br/>10. Rivera lived in the United States from 1930 to 1934.<br/>11. During this time, he put on an influential show of his easel work at the Museum of Modern Art.<br/>12. The success of Orozco and Rivera prompted U.S. artists to study in Mexico and opened doors for many other Mexican artists to find work in the country.<br/>13. Siqueiros did not fare as well.<br/>14. He was exiled to the US from Mexico in 1932, moving to Los Angeles.<br/>15. During this time, he painted three murals, but they were painted over.<br/>16. América Tropical, the only surviving public mural by David Alfaro Siqueiros in the United States is being conserved and construction of an adjoining visitor center is expected to be completed by 2012 or 2013.The concept of mural as political message was transplanted to the United States, especially in the former Mexican territory of the Southwest.<br/>17. It served as inspiration to the later Chicano Mural Movement but the political messages are different.<br/>",2,Where can murals be found?,,

Between 1936 and 1939, Poland invested heavily in the Central Industrial Region.<br/>2. Preparations for a defensive war with Germany were ongoing for many years, but most plans assumed fighting would not begin before 1942.<br/>3. To raise funds for industrial development, Poland sold much of the modern equipment it produced.<br/>4. In 1936, a National Defence Fund was set up to collect funds necessary for strengthening the Polish Armed forces.<br/>5. The Polish Army had approximately a million soldiers, but less than half were mobilized by 1 September.<br/>6. Latecomers sustained significant casualties when public transport became targets of the ""Luftwaffe"".<br/>7. The Polish military had fewer armored forces than the Germans, and these units, dispersed within the infantry, were unable to effectively engage the enemy.Experiences in the Polish-Soviet War shaped Polish Army organizational and operational doctrine.<br/>8. Unlike the trench warfare of World War I, the Polish-Soviet War was a conflict in which the cavalry's mobility played a decisive role.<br/>9. Poland acknowledged the benefits of mobility but was unable to invest heavily in many of the expensive, unproven inventions since then.<br/>10. In spite of this, Polish cavalry brigades were used as a mobile mounted infantry and had some successes against both German infantry and cavalry.The Polish Air Force (""Lotnictwo Wojskowe"") was at a severe disadvantage against the German ""Luftwaffe"", although it was not destroyed on the ground early on as is commonly believed.<br/>11. The Polish Air Force lacked modern fighters, but its pilots were among the world's best trained, as proven a year later in the Battle of Britain, in which the Poles played a major part.Overall, the Germans enjoyed numerical and qualitative aircraft superiority.<br/>12. Poland had only about 600 aircraft, of which only 37 P-37 ""Łoś"" bombers were modern and comparable to its German counterparts.<br/>13. The Polish Air Force had roughly 185 PZL P.11 and some 95 PZL P.7 fighters, 175 PZL.23 ""Karaś"" Bs, 35 ""Karaś"" As, and by September, over 100 PZL.37s were produced.<br/>14. However, for the September Campaign, only some 70% of those aircraft were mobilized.<br/>15. Only 36 PZL.37s were deployed.<br/>16. All those aircraft were of indigenous Polish design, with the bombers being more modern than fighters, according to the Ludomił Rayski air force expansion plan, which relied on a strong bomber force.<br/>17. The Polish fighters were a generation older than their German counterparts; the PZL P.11 fighter—produced in the early 1930s—had a top speed of only , far less than German bombers.<br/>18. To compensate, the pilots relied on its maneuverability and high diving speed.The tank force consisted of two armored brigades, four independent tank battalions and some 30 companies of TKS tankettes attached to infantry divisions and cavalry brigades.The Polish Navy was a small fleet of destroyers, submarines and smaller support vessels.<br/>19. Most Polish surface units followed Operation Peking, leaving Polish ports on 20 August and escaping by way of the North Sea to join with the British Royal Navy.<br/>20. Submarine forces participated in Operation Worek, with the goal of engaging and damaging German shipping in the Baltic Sea, but they had much less success.<br/>21. In addition, many merchant marine ships joined the British merchant fleet and took part in wartime convoys.<br/>",1,What happened between 1936 and 1939?,,

The dish, originally named ""Shaoyazi"" (燒鴨子), was mentioned in the ""Complete Recipes for Dishes and Beverages"" (飲膳正要) manual in 1330 by Hu Sihui (忽思慧), an inspector of the imperial kitchen.<br/>4. The Peking Roast Duck that came to be associated with the term was fully developed during the later Ming Dynasty, and by then, Peking Duck was one of the main dishes on imperial court menus.<br/>5. The first restaurant specialising in Peking Duck, Bianyifang, was established in the Xianyukou, Qianmen area of Beijing in 1416.By the Qianlong Period (1736–1796) of the Qing Dynasty, the popularity of Peking Duck spread to the upper classes, inspiring poetry from poets and scholars who enjoyed the dish.<br/>6. For instance, one of the verses of ""Duan Zhu Zhi Ci"", a collection of Beijing poems was, ""Fill your plates with roast duck and suckling pig"".<br/>7. In 1864, the Quanjude (全聚德) restaurant was established in Beijing.<br/>8. Yang Quanren (楊全仁), the founder of Quanjude, developed the hung oven to roast ducks.<br/>9. With its innovations and efficient management, the restaurant became well known in China, introducing the Peking Duck to the rest of the world.By the mid-20th century, Peking Duck had become a national symbol of China, favored by tourists and diplomats alike.<br/>10. For example, Henry Kissinger, the Secretary of State of the United States, met Premier Zhou Enlai in the Great Hall of the People on July 10, during his first visit to China.<br/>11. After a round of inconclusive talks in the morning, the delegation was served Peking Duck for lunch, which became Kissinger's favourite.<br/>12. The Americans and Chinese issued a joint statement the following day, inviting President Richard Nixon to visit China in 1972.<br/>13. Peking Duck was hence considered one of the factors behind the rapprochement of the United States to China in the 1970s.<br/>14. Following Zhou's death in 1976, Kissinger paid another visit to Beijing to savor Peking Duck.<br/>15. Peking Duck, at the Quanjude in particular, has also been a favorite dish for various political leaders ranging from Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro to former German chancellor Helmut Kohl.<br/>",1,When did duck roasting begin in China?,,

The demand for consistency between a quantum description of matter and a geometric description of spacetime, as well as the appearance of singularities (where curvature length scales become microscopic), indicate the need for a full theory of quantum gravity: for an adequate description of the interior of black holes, and of the very early universe, a theory is required in which gravity and the associated geometry of spacetime are described in the language of quantum physics.<br/>2. Despite major efforts, no complete and consistent theory of quantum gravity is currently known, even though a number of promising candidates exist.Attempts to generalize ordinary quantum field theories, used in elementary particle physics to describe fundamental interactions, so as to include gravity have led to serious problems.<br/>3. At low energies, this approach proves successful, in that it results in an acceptable effective (quantum) field theory of gravity.<br/>4. At very high energies, however, the result are models devoid of all predictive power (""non-renormalizability"").One attempt to overcome these limitations is string theory, a quantum theory not of point particles, but of minute one-dimensional extended objects.<br/>5. The theory promises to be a unified description of all particles and interactions, including gravity; the price to pay is unusual features such as six extra dimensions of space in addition to the usual three.<br/>6. In what is called the second superstring revolution, it was conjectured that both string theory and a unification of general relativity and supersymmetry known as supergravity form part of a hypothesized eleven-dimensional model known as M-theory, which would constitute a uniquely defined and consistent theory of quantum gravity.Another approach starts with the canonical quantization procedures of quantum theory.<br/>7. Using the initial-value-formulation of general relativity (cf.<br/>8. evolution equations above), the result is the Wheeler–deWitt equation (an analogue of the Schrödinger equation) which, regrettably, turns out to be ill-defined.<br/>9. However, with the introduction of what are now known as Ashtekar variables, this leads to a promising model known as loop quantum gravity.<br/>10. Space is represented by a web-like structure called a spin network, evolving over time in discrete steps.Depending on which features of general relativity and quantum theory are accepted unchanged, and on what level changes are introduced, there are numerous other attempts to arrive at a viable theory of quantum gravity, some examples being dynamical triangulations, causal sets, twistor models or the path-integral based models of quantum cosmology.All candidate theories still have major formal and conceptual problems to overcome.<br/>11. They also face the common problem that, as yet, there is no way to put quantum gravity predictions to experimental tests (and thus to decide between the candidates where their predictions vary), although there is hope for this to change as future data from cosmological observations and particle physics experiments becomes available.<br/>",10,How is space represented?,,

The official language of Sweden is Swedish, a North Germanic language, related and very similar to Danish and Norwegian, but differing in pronunciation and orthography.<br/>2. Norwegians have little difficulty understanding Swedish, and Danes can also understand it, with slightly more difficulty than the Norwegians.<br/>3. The same goes for standard Swedish speakers, who find it far easier to understand Norwegian than Danish.<br/>4. The dialects spoken in Scania, the southernmost part of the country, are influenced by Danish because the region traditionally was a part of Denmark and is nowadays situated closely to it.<br/>5. Sweden Finns are Sweden's largest linguistic minority, comprising about 5% of Sweden's population, and Finnish is recognized as a minority language.Along with Finnish, four other minority languages are also recognized: Meänkieli, Sami, Romani and Yiddish.<br/>6. Swedish became Sweden's official language on 1 July 2009, when a new language law was implemented.<br/>7. The issue of whether Swedish should be declared the official language has been raised in the past, and the Riksdag voted on the matter in 2005, but the proposal narrowly failed.In varying degrees, depending largely on frequency of interaction with English, a majority of Swedes, especially those born after World War II, understand and speak English owing to trade links, the popularity of overseas travel, a strong Anglo-American influence and the tradition of subtitling rather than dubbing foreign television shows and films, and the relative similarity of the two languages which makes learning English easier.<br/>8. In a 2005 survey by Eurobarometer, 89% of Swedes reported the ability to speak English.English became a compulsory subject for secondary school students studying natural sciences as early as 1849, and has been a compulsory subject for all Swedish students since the late 1940s.<br/>9. Depending on the local school authorities, English is currently a compulsory subject between first grade and ninth grade, with all students continuing in secondary school studying English for at least another year.<br/>10. Most students also study one and sometimes two additional languages.<br/>11. These include (but are not limited to) German, French and Spanish.<br/>12.

Culture.Literature.Ireland has made a significant contribution to world literature in both the English and Irish languages.<br/>2. Modern Irish fiction began with the publishing of the 1726 novel ""Gulliver's Travels"" by Jonathan Swift.<br/>3. Other writers of importance during the 18th century and their most notable works include Laurence Sterne with the publication of ""The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman"" and Oliver Goldsmith's ""The Vicar of Wakefield"".<br/>4. Numerous Irish novelists emerged during the 19th century, including Maria Edgeworth, John Banim, Gerald Griffin, Charles Kickham, William Carleton, George Moore, and Somerville and Ross.<br/>5. Bram Stoker is best known as the author of the 1897 novel ""Dracula"".James Joyce (1882–1941) published his most famous work ""Ulysses"" in 1922, which is an interpretation of the ""Odyssey"" set in Dublin.<br/>6. Edith Somerville continued writing after the death of her partner Martin Ross in 1915.<br/>7. Dublin's Annie M. P. Smithson was one of several authors catering for fans of romantic fiction in the 1920s and 1930s.<br/>8. After the Second World War, popular novels were published by, among others, Brian O'Nolan, who published as Flann O'Brien, Elizabeth Bowen, and Kate O'Brien.<br/>9. During the final decades of the 20th century, Edna O'Brien, John McGahern, Maeve Binchy, Joseph O'Connor, Roddy Doyle, Colm Tóibín, and John Banville came to the fore as novelists.Patricia Lynch (1898–1972) was a prolific children's author, while Eoin Colfer has been particularly successful in this genre in recent years.<br/>10. In the genre of the short story, which is a form favoured by many Irish writers, the most prominent figures include Seán Ó Faoláin, Frank O'Connor and William Trevor.<br/>11. Well known Irish poets include Patrick Kavanagh, Thomas McCarthy, Dermot Bolger, and Nobel Prize in Literature laureates William Butler Yeats and Seamus Heaney (born in Northern Ireland but resided in Dublin).<br/>12. Prominent writers in the Irish language are Pádraic Ó Conaire, Máirtín Ó Cadhain, Séamus Ó Grianna, and Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill.The history of Irish theatre begins with the expansion of the English administration in Dublin during the early 17th century, and since then, Ireland has significantly contributed to English drama.<br/>13. In its early history, theatrical productions in Ireland tended to serve political purposes, but as more theatres opened and the popular audience grew, a more diverse range of entertainments were staged.<br/>14. Many Dublin-based theatres developed links with their London equivalents, and British productions frequently found their way to the Irish stage.<br/>15. However, most Irish playwrights went abroad to establish themselves.<br/>16. In the 18th century, Oliver Goldsmith and Richard Brinsley Sheridan were two of the most successful playwrights on the London stage at that time.<br/>17. At the beginning of the 20th century, theatre companies dedicated to the staging of Irish plays and the development of writers, directors and performers began to emerge, which allowed many Irish playwrights to learn their trade and establish their reputations in Ireland rather than in Britain or the United States.<br/>18. Following in the tradition of acclaimed practitioners, principally Oscar Wilde and Literature Nobel Prize laureates George Bernard Shaw (1925), and Samuel Beckett (1969), playwrights such as Seán O'Casey, Brian Friel, Sebastian Barry, Brendan Behan, Conor McPherson, and Billy Roche have gained popular success.<br/>19. Other Irish playwrights of the 20th century include Denis Johnston, Thomas Kilroy, Tom Murphy, Hugh Leonard, Frank McGuinness, and John B. Keane.<br/>",2,What started modern Irish fiction?,,

The Walt Disney Company's original concept of the Disney-MGM Studios was to operate it as a full fledged television and motion picture production facility, not just a theme park.<br/>2. In 1988, among the first feature-length movies filmed at the facility, prior to its completion and opening as a theme park, were ""Ernest Saves Christmas"" and ""Newsies"".<br/>3. When the park opened in 1989, the studio/production facilities housed two major components, the first of which was Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida, where Disney produced a number of projects, including ""Mulan"", ""Lilo & Stitch"", ""Brother Bear"", and sequences from other 1990s-early 2000s Disney animated features.<br/>4. The second, larger component was Walt Disney Studios Florida, which consisted of three sound stages used for various Disney projects including The Disney Channel's ""Mickey Mouse Club"", ""Teen Win, Lose or Draw"" and ""Adventures in Wonderland"".<br/>5. Several third party productions also used the Studios, including ""Superboy"" (first season only, from 1988–1989), ""Thunder in Paradise"", a revival of ""Let's Make a Deal"", special broadcasts of ""Wheel of Fortune"" and airplane interior sequences for the feature film ""Passenger 57"".<br/>6. In addition, a number of music videos and several tapings for World Championship Wrestling (as well as live broadcasts of WCW Monday Nitro) were also shot there.<br/>7. Even The Post Group had a Florida-based post-production facility located on the Studio lot throughout the 1990s.<br/>8. All these production and post-production facilities were constructed to be an integral part of the theme park's Backstage Studio Tour as well.During the closing credits of the ""Mickey Mouse Club"" (later, ""MMC"" in its final seasons) and ""Adventures in Wonderland"", the lit Disney-MGM water tower appeared on the screen and one of the cast said, ""(insert show title here) was taped at the Disney-MGM Studios at the Walt Disney World Resort, Lake Buena Vista, Florida.""<br/>9. Disney management (including CEO Michael Eisner) decided to downsize Disney's Florida operations by closing the animation studio, laying-off personnel and then moving the operations to the main animation studio in Burbank, California.A radio studio is also located on the lot, appropriately behind ""Sounds Dangerous"".<br/>10. It originally housed the first children's radio network Radio Aahs which rented the studio.<br/>11. Later, Disney founded Radio Disney and essentially drove Radio Aahs out of business.<br/>12. Radio Disney decided it was no longer profitable to operate in Florida so they moved all of their shows from the Disney-MGM Studios to the Radio Disney headquarters in Dallas, Texas and the once bustling Disney Studios Florida radio studios are now used as remote studios for radio shows that are visiting Disney or the Orlando area and need a broadcast facility.<br/>",3,When did the  park open?,,

Different cancers respond differently to radiation therapy.The response of a cancer to radiation is described by its radiosensitivity.Highly radiosensitive cancer cells are rapidly killed by modest doses of radiation.<br/>2. These include leukemias, most lymphomas and germ cell tumors.The majority of epithelial cancers are only moderately radiosensitive, and require a significantly higher dose of radiation (60-70 Gy) to achieve a radical cure.Some types of cancer are notably radioresistant, that is, much higher doses are required to produce a radical cure than may be safe in clinical practice.<br/>3. Renal cell cancer and melanoma are generally considered to be radioresistant.It is important to distinguish the radiosensitivity of a particular tumor, which to some extent is a laboratory measure, from the radiation ""curability"" of a cancer in actual clinical practice.<br/>4. For example, leukemias are not generally curable with radiation therapy, because they are disseminated through the body.<br/>5. Lymphoma may be radically curable if it is localised to one area of the body.<br/>6. Similarly, many of the common, moderately radioresponsive tumors are routinely treated with curative doses of radiation therapy if they are at an early stage.<br/>7. For example: non-melanoma skin cancer, head and neck cancer, breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, cervical cancer, anal cancer, prostate cancer.<br/>8. Metastatic cancers are generally incurable with radiation therapy because it is not possible to treat the whole body.Before treatment, a CT scan is often performed to identify the tumor and surrounding normal structures.<br/>9. The patient is then sent for a simulation so that molds can be created to be used during treatment.<br/>10. The patient receives small skin marks to guide the placement of treatment fields.The response of a tumor to radiation therapy is also related to its size.<br/>11. For complex reasons, very large tumors respond less well to radiation than smaller tumors or microscopic disease.<br/>12. Various strategies are used to overcome this effect.<br/>13. The most common technique is surgical resection prior to radiation therapy.<br/>14. This is most commonly seen in the treatment of breast cancer with wide local excision or mastectomy followed by adjuvant radiation therapy.<br/>15. Another method is to shrink the tumor with neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to radical radiation therapy.<br/>16. A third technique is to enhance the radiosensitivity of the cancer by giving certain drugs during a course of radiation therapy.<br/>17. Examples of radiosensiting drugs include: Cisplatin, Nimorazole, and Cetuximab.<br/>",1,Do all cancers respond in the same way to chemo?,,

Since its inception, the many counter-intuitive aspects and results of quantum mechanics have provoked strong philosophical debates and many interpretations.<br/>2. Even fundamental issues, such as Max Born's basic rules concerning probability amplitudes and probability distributions took decades to be appreciated by society and many leading scientists.<br/>3. Richard Feynman once said, ""I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.""<br/>4. According to Steven Weinberg, ""There is now in my opinion no entirely satisfactory interpretation of quantum mechanics.<br/>5. ""The Copenhagen interpretation - due largely to the Danish theoretical physicist Niels Bohr - remains the quantum mechanical formalism that is currently most widely accepted amongst physicists, some 75 years after its enunciation.<br/>6. According to this interpretation, the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics is not a ""temporary"" feature which will eventually be replaced by a deterministic theory, but instead must be considered a ""final"" renunciation of the classical idea of ""causality"".<br/>7. It is also believed therein that any well-defined application of the quantum mechanical formalism must always make reference to the experimental arrangement, due to the complementarity nature of evidence obtained under different experimental situations.Albert Einstein, himself one of the founders of quantum theory, disliked this loss of determinism in measurement.<br/>8. Einstein held that there should be a local hidden variable theory underlying quantum mechanics and, consequently, that the present theory was incomplete.<br/>9. He produced a series of objections to the theory, the most famous of which has become known as the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox.<br/>10. John Bell showed that this ""EPR"" paradox led to experimentally testable differences between quantum mechanics and local realistic theories.<br/>11. Experiments have been performed confirming the accuracy of quantum mechanics, thereby demonstrating that the physical world cannot be described by any local realistic theory.<br/>12. The ""Bohr-Einstein debates"" provide a vibrant critique of the Copenhagen Interpretation from an epistemological point of view.The Everett many-worlds interpretation, formulated in 1956, holds that ""all"" the possibilities described by quantum theory ""simultaneously"" occur in a multiverse composed of mostly independent parallel universes.<br/>13. This is not accomplished by introducing some ""new axiom"" to quantum mechanics, but on the contrary, by ""removing"" the axiom of the collapse of the wave packet.<br/>14. ""All"" of the possible consistent states of the measured system and the measuring apparatus (including the observer) are present in a ""real"" physical - not just formally mathematical, as in other interpretations - quantum superposition.<br/>15. Such a superposition of consistent state combinations of different systems is called an entangled state.<br/>16. While the multiverse is deterministic, we perceive non-deterministic behavior governed by probabilities, because we can observe only the universe (i.e., the consistent state contribution to the aforementioned superposition) that we, as observers, inhabit.<br/>17. Everett's interpretation is perfectly consistent with John Bell's experiments and makes them intuitively understandable.<br/>18. However, according to the theory of quantum decoherence, these ""parallel universes"" will never be accessible to us.<br/>19. The inaccessibility can be understood as follows: once a measurement is done, the measured system becomes entangled with ""both"" the physicist who measured it ""and"" a huge number of other particles, some of which are photons flying away at the speed of light towards the other end of the universe.<br/>20. In order to prove that the wave function did not collapse, one would have to bring ""all"" these particles back and measure them again, together with the system that was originally measured.<br/>21. Not only is this completely impractical, but even if one ""could"" theoretically do this, it would have to destroy any evidence that the original measurement took place (to include the physicist's memory!<br/>22. ); in light of these Bell tests, Cramer (1986) formulated his transactional interpretation.<br/>23. Relational quantum mechanics appeared in the late 1990s as the modern derivative of the Copenhagen Interpretation.<br/>",23,When did relational quantum mechanics appear?,,

Other definitions of the word have been in use at least since 1810.While the exact provenance of the word """"poutine"""" is uncertain, some of its meanings undoubtedly result at least in part from the influence of the English word ""pudding"".<br/>3. Among its various culinary senses, that of ""a dessert made from flour or bread crumbs"" most clearly shows this influence; the word ""pouding"", borrowed from the English ""pudding"", is in fact a synonym in this sense.<br/>4. The pejorative meaning ""fat person"" of ""poutine"" (used especially in speaking of a woman) is believed to derive from the English ""pudding"" ""a person or thing resembling a pudding"" or ""stout, thick-set person"".In other meanings of ""poutine"", the existence of a relation to the English word ""pudding"" is uncertain.<br/>5. One of these additional meanings — the one from which the name of the dish with fries is thought to derive — is ""unappetizing mixture of various foods, usually leftovers.""<br/>6. This sense may also have given rise to the meaning ""complicated business, complex organization; set of operations whose management is difficult or problematic.<br/>7. ""The ""Dictionnaire historique"" mentions the possibility that the form ""poutine"" is simply a gallicization of the word ""pudding"".<br/>8. However, it considers it more likely that it was inherited from regional languages spoken in France, and that some of its meanings resulted from the later influence of the similar-sounding English word ""pudding"".<br/>9. It cites the Provençal forms ""poutingo"" ""bad stew"" and ""poutité"" ""hodgepodge"" or ""crushed fruit or foods""; ""poutringo"" ""mixture of various things"" in Languedocien; and ""poutringue"", ""potringa"" ""bad stew"" in Franche-Comté as possibly related to ""poutine"".<br/>10.

Likewise, a long-standing family friend, Hermanus Tersteeg, an influential art dealer who taught van Gogh and his brother Theo a great deal about art and literature, and who gave van Gogh his first set of art supplies when he decided to become an artist, although he was always somewhat equivocal in his support, abruptly withdrew at the same time.Van Gogh's relationship with Mauve in truth had scarcely lasted a month.<br/>5. Already by the end of January, van Gogh was writing his brother Theo that he did not always find it easy to get on with Mauve.<br/>6. Shortly after this, they fell out with each other over an issue involving drawing from plaster casts, which Mauve was anxious van Gogh should undertake to perfect his technique.<br/>7. Van Gogh, however, vehemently insisted on drawing from models, and in a fit of pique destroyed some plaster casts of hands and feet that Mauve had given him to make studies from.<br/>8. Following that incident, Mauve said he would have nothing more to do with him for the next two months (i.e.<br/>9. for the rest of the winter).<br/>10. In reality, Mauve, had resolved to break with van Gogh completely.<br/>11. Van Gogh initially blamed Tersteeg for Mauve's indifference, but a chance meeting with Mauve in May made it clear to him that Mauve had definitively broken with him.<br/>12. He described the meeting in a letter to Theo, and in the same letter he revealed his relationship with Sien for the first time and passionately defended it:Van Gogh left Sien the autumn of 1883.<br/>13. Van Gogh went to Drenthe to paint and Sien went back to work as a seamstress, charwoman and possibly as a prostitute.<br/>14. Her children, Maria and Willem, lived with Sien's mother and brother Pieter.<br/>15. In 1901 Sien married a seaman, Anton van Wijk.<br/>16. She committed suicide in 1904 at the age of 54 in Rotterdam's harbor, 14 years after van Gogh's death.<br/>",3,What was Hulsker's opinion?,,

The origin of rugby football is reputed to be an incident during a game of English school football at Rugby School in 1823 when William Webb Ellis is said to have picked up the ball and run with it.<br/>2. Although the evidence for the story is doubtful, it was immortalised at the school with a plaque unveiled in 1895.<br/>3. Despite the doubtful evidence, the Rugby World Cup trophy is named after Webb Ellis.<br/>4. Rugby football stems from the form of game played at Rugby School, which former pupils then introduced to their university.<br/>5. Old Rugbeian Albert Pell, a student at Cambridge, is credited with having formed the first ""football"" team.<br/>6. During this early period different schools used different rules, with former pupils from Rugby and Eton attempting to carry their preferred rules through to their universities.A significant event in the early development of rugby football was the production of the first written laws of the game at Rugby School in 1845, which was followed by the 'Cambridge Rules' drawn up in 1848.<br/>7. Other important events include the Blackheath Club's decision to leave the Football Association in 1863 and the formation of the Rugby Football Union in 1871.<br/>8. The code was originally known as ""rugby football""; it was not until after the schism in England in 1895, which resulted in the separate code of rugby league, that the sport took on the name ""rugby union"" to differentiate it from the league game.<br/>9. Despite the sport's full name of rugby union, it is known simply as rugby throughout most of the world.The first rugby football international was played on 27 March 1871 between England and Scotland.<br/>10. By 1881 both Ireland and Wales had representative teams, and in 1883 the first international competition, the Home Nations Championship had begun.<br/>11. 1883 is also the year of the first rugby sevens tournament, the Melrose Sevens, which is still held annually.<br/>12. Five years later two important overseas tours took place: a British Isles team visited Australia and New Zealand—although a private venture, it laid the foundations for future British and Irish Lions tours; and the 1888–89 New Zealand Native football team brought the first overseas team to British spectators.Between 1905 and 1908, all three major Southern Hemisphere rugby countries sent their first touring teams to the Northern Hemisphere: New Zealand in 1905, followed by South Africa in 1906 and Australia in 1908.<br/>13. All three teams brought new styles of play, fitness levels and tactics, and were far more successful than critics had expected.<br/>14. The New Zealand 1905 touring team performed a haka before each match, leading Welsh Rugby Union administrator Tom Williams to suggest that Wales player Teddy Morgan lead the crowd in singing the Welsh National Anthem, ""Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau"", as a response.<br/>15. After Morgan began singing, the crowd joined in: the first time a national anthem was sung at the start of a sporting event.<br/>16. In 1905 France played England in its first international match.No international rugby games and union-sponsored club matches were played during the First World War, but competitions continued through service teams such as the New Zealand Army team.<br/>17. During the Second World War no international matches were played by most countries, though Italy, Germany and Romania played a limited number of games, and Cambridge and Oxford continued their annual University Match.Rugby union was included as an event in the Olympic Games four times during the early 20th century.<br/>18. In 1973 the first officially sanctioned international sevens tournament took place at Murrayfield, one of Scotland's biggest stadiums, as part of the Scottish Rugby Union centenary celebrations.<br/>19. In 1987 the first Rugby World Cup was held in Australia and New Zealand, and the inaugural winners were New Zealand.<br/>20. The first World Cup Sevens tournament was held at Murrayfield in 1993.<br/>21. Rugby Sevens was introduced into the Commonwealth Games in 1998 and is due to be added to the Olympic Games by 2016.Rugby union was an amateur sport until the IRB declared the game ""open"" in 1995, removing restrictions on payments to players.<br/>22. However, the pre-1995 period of rugby union was marked by frequent accusations of ""shamateurism"", including an investigation in Britain by a House of Commons Select committee.<br/>23. Following the introduction of professionalism trans-national club competitions were started, with the Heineken Cup in the Northern Hemisphere and Super Rugby in the Southern Hemisphere.<br/>24. The Tri-nations, an annual international tournament involving Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, kicked off in 1996.<br/>",1,When did rugby originate?,,

Contemporary medicine is in general conducted within health care systems.<br/>2.

The characteristics of any given health care system have significant impact on the way medical care is provided.From ancient times, Christian emphasis on practical charity gave rise to the development of systematic nursing and hospitals and the Catholic Church today remains the largest non-government provider of medical services in the world.<br/>4. Advanced industrial countries (with the exception of the United States) and many developing countries provide medical services through a system of universal health care that aims to guarantee care for all through a single-payer health care system, or compulsory private or co-operative health insurance.<br/>5. This is intended to ensure that the entire population has access to medical care on the basis of need rather than ability to pay.<br/>6. Delivery may be via private medical practices or by state-owned hospitals and clinics, or by charities, most commonly by a combination of all three.Most tribal societies, and the United States, provide no guarantee of healthcare for the population as a whole.<br/>7. In such societies, healthcare is available to those that can afford to pay for it or have self-insured it (either directly or as part of an employment contract) or who may be covered by care financed by the government or tribe directly.Transparency of information is another factor defining a delivery system.<br/>8. Access to information on conditions, treatments, quality, and pricing greatly affects the choice by patients/consumers and, therefore, the incentives of medical professionals.<br/>9. While the US healthcare system has come under fire for lack of openness, new legislation may encourage greater openness.<br/>10. There is a perceived tension between the need for transparency on the one hand and such issues as patient confidentiality and the possible exploitation of information for commercial gain on the other.<br/>",1,Where is general medicine practiced?,,

According to the current Rules of Hockey 2013 issued by the FIH there are only two criteria for a dangerously played ball.<br/>2. The first is legitimate evasive action by an opponent (what constitutes legitimate evasive action is an umpiring judgment).<br/>3. The second is specific to the rule concerning a shot at goal at a penalty corner but is generally, if somewhat inconsistently, applied throughout the game and in all parts of the pitch: it is that a ball lifted above knee height and at an opponent who is within 5m of the ball is certainly dangerous.The velocity of the ball is not mentioned in the rules concerning a dangerously played ball.<br/>4. A ball that hits a player above the knee may on some occasions not be penalized, this is in the umpire's discretion.<br/>5. A jab tackle for example, might accidentally lift the ball above knee height into an opponent from close range but at such low velocity as not to be, in the opinion of the umpire, dangerous play.<br/>6. In the same way a high velocity hit at very close range into an opponent, but below knee height, could be considered to be dangerous or reckless play in the view of the umpire, especially when safer alternatives are open to the striker of the ball.A ball that has been lifted high so that it will fall among close opponents may be deemed to be potentially dangerous and play may be stopped for that reason.<br/>7. A lifted ball that is falling to a player in clear space may be made potentially dangerous by the actions of an opponent closing to within 5m of the receiver before the ball has been controlled to ground – a rule which is often only loosely applied; the distance allowed is often only what might be described as playing distance, 2–3 m, and opponents tend to be permitted to close on the ball as soon as the receiver plays it: these unofficial variations are often based on the umpire's perception of the skill of the players i.e.<br/>8. on the level of the game, in order to maintain game flow, which umpires are in general in both Rules and Briefing instructed to do, by not penalising when it is unnecessary to do so, this is also a matter in the umpire's discretion.The term ""falling ball"" is important in what may be termed encroaching offences.<br/>9. It is generally only considered an offence to encroach on an opponent receiving a lifted ball that has been lifted to above head height (although the height is not specified in rule) and is falling.<br/>10. So, for example, a lifted shot at the goal which is still rising as it crosses the goal line (or would have been rising as it crossed the goal line) can be legitimately followed up by any of the attacking team looking for a rebound.In general even potentially dangerous play is not penalised if an opponent is not disadvantage by it or, obviously, not injured by it so that he cannot continue.<br/>11. A personal penalty, that is a caution or a suspension, rather than a team penalty, such as a free ball or a penalty corner, may be (many would say should be or even must be, but again this is in the umpire's discretion) issued to the guilty party after an advantage allowed by the umpire has been played out in any situation where an offence has occurred, including dangerous play (but once advantage has been allowed the umpire cannot then call play back and award a team penalty).It is not an offence to lift the ball over an opponent's stick (or body on the ground), provided that it is done with consideration for the safety of the opponent and not dangerously.<br/>12. For example, a skillful attacker may lift the ball over a defenders stick or prone body and run past them, however if the attacker lifts the ball into or at the defender's body, this would almost certainly be regarded as dangerous.It is not against the rules to bounce the ball on the stick and even to run with it while doing so, as long as that does not lead to a potentially dangerous conflict with an opponent who is attempting to make a tackle.<br/>13. For example, two players trying to play at the ball in the air at the same time, would probably be considered a dangerous situation and it is likely that the player who first put the ball up or who was so 'carrying' it would be penalised.Dangerous play rules also apply to the usage of the stick when approaching the ball, making a stroke at it (replacing what was at one time referred to as the ""sticks"" rule, which once forbade the raising of any part of the stick above the shoulder during any play.<br/>14. This last restriction has been removed but the stick should still not be used in a way that endangers an opponent) or attempting to tackle, (fouls relating to tripping, impeding and obstruction).<br/>15. The use of the stick to strike an opponent will usually be much more severely dealt with by the umpires than offences such as barging, impeding and obstruction with the body, although these are also dealt with firmly, especially when these fouls are intentional: field hockey is a non-contact sport.Players may not play or attempt to play at the ball above their shoulders unless trying to save a shot that could go into the goal, in which case they are permitted to stop the ball or deflect it safely away.<br/>16. A swing, as in a hit, at a high shot at the goal (or even wide of the goal) will probably be considered dangerous play if at opponents within 5 m and such a stroke would be contrary to rule in these circumstances anyway.Within the English National League it is now a legal action to take a ball above shoulder height if completed using a controlled action.<br/>",5,What is the danger of a jab tackle?,,

Maple syrup production is centred in northeastern North America; however, given the correct weather conditions, it can be made wherever suitable species of maple trees grow.A maple syrup production farm is called a ""sugarbush"" or ""sugarwood"".<br/>2. Sap is often boiled in a ""sugar house"" (also known as a ""sugar shack,"" ""sugar shanty,"" or ""cabane à sucre""), a building louvered at the top to vent the steam from the boiling sap.Maples are usually tapped beginning at 30 to 40 years of age.<br/>3. Each tree can support between one and three taps, depending on its trunk diameter.<br/>4. The average maple tree will produce of sap per season, up to per day.<br/>5. This is roughly equal to 7% of its total sap.<br/>6. Seasons last for four to eight weeks, depending on the weather.<br/>7. During the day, starch stored in the roots for the winter rises through the trunk as sugary sap, allowing it to be tapped.<br/>8. Sap is not tapped at night because the temperature drop inhibits sap flow, although taps are typically left in place overnight.<br/>9. Some producers also tap in autumn, though this practice is less common than spring tapping.<br/>10. Maples can continue to be tapped for sap until they are over 100 years old.<br/>",1,Where is most maple syrup produced?,,

Around the time of the American Civil War, syrup makers started using large, flat sheet metal pans as they were more efficient for boiling than heavy, rounded iron kettles, because of a greater surface area for evaporation.<br/>2. Around this time, cane sugar replaced maple sugar as the dominant sweetener in the US; as a result, producers focused marketing efforts on maple syrup.<br/>3. The first evaporator, used to heat and concentrate sap, was patented in 1858.<br/>4. In 1872, an evaporator was developed that featured two pans and a metal arch or firebox, which greatly decreased boiling time.<br/>5. Around 1900, producers bent the tin that formed the bottom of a pan into a series of flues, which increased the heated surface area of the pan and again decreased boiling time.<br/>6. Some producers also added a finishing pan, a separate batch evaporator, as a final stage in the evaporation process.Buckets began to be replaced with plastic bags, which allowed people to see at a distance how much sap had been collected.<br/>7. Syrup producers also began using tractors to haul vats of sap from the trees being tapped (the sugarbush) to the evaporator.<br/>8. Some producers adopted motor-powered tappers and metal tubing systems to convey sap from the tree to a central collection container, but these techniques were not widely used.<br/>9. Heating methods also diversified: modern producers use wood, oil, natural gas, propane, or steam to evaporate sap.<br/>10. Modern filtration methods were perfected to prevent contamination of the syrup.A large number of technological changes took place during the 1970s.<br/>11. Plastic tubing systems that had been experimental since the early part of the century were perfected, and the sap came directly from the tree to the evaporator house.<br/>12. Vacuum pumps were added to the tubing systems, and preheaters were developed to recycle heat lost in the steam.<br/>13. Producers developed reverse-osmosis machines to take a portion of water out of the sap before it was boiled, increasing processing efficiency.Improvements in tubing and vacuum pumps, new filtering techniques, ""supercharged"" preheaters, and better storage containers have since been developed.<br/>14. Research continues on pest control and improved woodlot management.<br/>15. In 2009, researchers at the University of Vermont unveiled a new type of tap that prevents backflow of sap into the tree, reducing bacterial contamination and preventing the tree from attempting to heal the bore hole.<br/>16. Experiments show that it may be possible to use saplings in a plantation instead of mature trees dramatically boosting productivity per acre.<br/>",3,When was the first evaporator patented?,,

In general terms, gravitational waves are radiated by objects whose motion involves acceleration, provided that the motion is not perfectly spherically symmetric (like an expanding or contracting sphere) or cylindrically symmetric (like a spinning disk or sphere).<br/>2. A simple example of this principle is provided by the spinning dumbbell.<br/>3. If the dumbbell spins like wheels on an axle, it will not radiate gravitational waves; if it tumbles end over end like two planets orbiting each other, it will radiate gravitational waves.<br/>4. The heavier the dumbbell, and the faster it tumbles, the greater is the gravitational radiation it will give off.<br/>5. If we imagine an extreme case in which the two weights of the dumbbell are massive stars like neutron stars or black holes, orbiting each other quickly, then significant amounts of gravitational radiation would be given off.Some more detailed examples:<br/>6. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two objects orbiting each other in a quasi-Keplerian planar orbit (basically, as a planet would orbit the Sun) will radiate.<br/>7. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A spinning non-axisymmetric planetoid — say with a large bump or dimple on the equator — will radiate.<br/>8. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A supernova will radiate except in the unlikely event that the explosion is perfectly symmetric.<br/>9. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An isolated non-spinning solid object moving at a constant velocity will not radiate.<br/>10.

This can be regarded as a consequence of the principle of conservation of angular momentum.<br/>13. However, it ""will"" show gravitomagnetic effects.<br/>14. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A spherically pulsating spherical star (non-zero monopole moment or mass, but zero quadrupole moment) will not radiate, in agreement with Birkhoff's theorem.<br/><br/>15. More technically, the third time derivative of the quadrupole moment (or the ""l""-th time derivative of the ""l""-th multipole moment) of an isolated system's stress–energy tensor must be nonzero in order for it to emit gravitational radiation.</br>16.

According to Paul Farmer, the main problem for modern medicine is lack of access in poor regions.<br/>2. There is an ""outcome gap"" between the rich and poor that is most noticeable with expensive-to-treat diseases like AIDS and tuberculosis.<br/>3. The majority of medical resources and therapies are concentrated in the rich, low-incidence regions such as the West.<br/>4. On the other hand, countries in the developing world have high rates of HIV but lack the necessary resources to treat them.Medical errors and overmedication and other forms of iatrogenesis (harms caused by medical treatment) are also the focus of complaints and negative coverage.<br/>5. Practitioners of human factors engineering believe that there is much that medicine may usefully gain by emulating concepts in aviation safety, where it is recognized that it is dangerous to place too much responsibility on one ""superhuman"" individual and expect him or her not to make errors.<br/>6. Reporting systems and checking mechanisms are becoming more common in identifying sources of error and improving practice.<br/>7. Clinical versus statistical, algorithmic diagnostic methods were famously examined in psychiatric practice in a 1954 book by Paul E. Meehl, which found statistical methods superior.<br/>8. A 2000 meta-analysis comparing these methods in both psychology and medicine found that statistical or ""mechanical"" diagnostic methods were, in general, although not always, superior.Disparities in quality of care given among local demographics are often an additional cause of controversy.<br/>9. For example, elderly mentally ill patients received poorer care during hospitalization in a 2008 study.<br/>10. Rural poor African-American men were used in an infamous study of syphilis that denied them basic medical care.<br/>",1,What is modern medicine's main problem?,,

First Empire to July Monarchy (1800–1850).With the advent of Napoléon and the First Empire, the status of Versailles changed again.<br/>2. Paintings and other art work that had previously been assigned to the ""Muséum national"" and the ""Musée spécial de l'École française"" were systematically dispersed to other locations and eventually the museum was closed.<br/>3. In accordance with the provisions of the 1804 Constitution, Versailles was designated as the Imperial palace located in the Department of the Seine-et-Oise.The Bourbon Restoration saw little activity at Versailles.<br/>4. Areas of the gardens were replanted but no significant restoration or modifications of the interiors were undertaken, despite the fact that Louis XVIII would often visit the palace and walk through the vacant rooms (Manse, 2004; Thompson, 2006).<br/>5. Charles X chose the Tuileries Palace over Versailles and rarely visited his former home (Castelot, 2001).With the Revolution of 1830 and the establishment of the July Monarchy, the status of Versailles changed.<br/>6. In March 1832, the ""Loi de la Liste civile"" was promulgated, which designated Versailles as a crown dependency.<br/>7. Like Napoléon before him, Louis-Philippe chose to live at the Grand Trianon; however, unlike Napoléon, Louis-Philippe did have a grand design for Versailles.In 1833, Louis-Philippe proposed the establishment of a museum dedicated to “all the glories of France,” which included the Orléans dynasty and the Revolution of 1830 that had put him on the throne of France.<br/>8. For the next decade, under the direction of Eugène-Charles-Frédéric Nepveu and Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine, the château underwent major alterations (Constans, 1985; 1987; Mauguin, 1937; Verlet, 1985).<br/>9. The museum was officially inaugurated on 10 June 1837 as part of the festivities that surrounded the marriage of the Prince royal, Ferdinand-Philippe d'Orléans with princess Hélène of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and represented one of the most ambitious and costly undertakings of Louis-Philippe's reign.<br/>10.

The ""galerie des Batailles"" was an epigone of the ""Grande galerie"" of the Louvre Palace and was intended to glorify French military history from the Battle of Tolbiac (traditionally dated 495) to the Battle of Wagram (5–6 July 1809).<br/>12. While a number of the paintings displayed in the ""galerie des Batailles"" were of questionable quality, a few masterpieces, such as the ""Battle of Taillebourg"" by Eugène Delacroix, were displayed here.<br/>13. Part of the ""aile du Nord"" was converted for the ""Salle des Croisades"", a room dedicated to famous knights of the Crusades and decorated with their names and coats of arms.<br/>14. The apartments of the dauphin and the dauphine as well as those of Louis XV's daughters on the ground floor of the ""corps de logis"" were transformed into portrait galleries.<br/>15. To accommodate the displays, some of the ""boiseries"" were removed and either put into storage or sold.<br/>16. During the Prussian occupation of the palace in 1871, the ""boiseries"" in storage were burned as firewood (Constans, 1985; 1987; Mauguin, 1937; Verlet,1985).<br/>",2,What happened to the art in the museum?,,

It banned the FIS, triggering a civil insurgency between the Front's armed wing, the Armed Islamic Group, and the national armed forces, in which more than 100,000 persons are thought to have died.<br/>5. The Islamist militants conducted a violent campaign of civilian massacres.<br/>6. At several points in the conflict, the situation in Algeria became a point of international concern, most notably during the crisis surrounding Air France Flight 8969, a hijacking perpetrated by the Armed Islamic Group.<br/>7. The Armed Islamic Group declared a ceasefire in October 1997.Algeria held elections in 1999, considered biased by international observers and most opposition groups which were won by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika.<br/>8. He worked to restore political stability to the country and announced a 'Civil Concord' initiative, approved in a referendum, under which many political prisoners were pardoned, and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under a limited amnesty, in force until 13 January 2000.<br/>9. The AIS disbanded and levels of insurgent violence fell rapidly.<br/>10. The Groupe Salafiste pour la Prédication et le Combat (GSPC), a splinter group of the Group Islamic Armée, continued a terrorist campaign against the Government.Bouteflika was re-elected in the April 2004 presidential election after campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation.<br/>11. The programme comprised economic, institutional, political and social reform to modernise the country, raise living standards, and tackle the causes of alienation.<br/>12. It also included a second amnesty initiative, the Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation, which was approved in a referendum in September 2005.<br/>13. It offered amnesty to most guerrillas and Government security forces.In November 2008, the Algerian Constitution was amended following a vote in Parliament, removing the two-term limit on Presidential incumbents.<br/>14. This change enabled Bouteflika to stand for re-election in the 2009 presidential elections, and he was re-elected in April 2009.<br/>15. During his election campaign and following his re-election, Bouteflika promised to extend the programme of national reconciliation and a $150-billion spending programme to create three million new jobs, the construction of one million new housing units, and to continue public sector and infrastructure modernisation programmes.A continuing series of protests throughout the country started on 28 December 2010, inspired by similar protests across the Middle East and North Africa.<br/>16. On 24 February 2011, the government lifted Algeria's 19-year-old state of emergency.<br/>17. The government enacted legislation dealing with political parties, the electoral code, and the representation of women in elected bodies.<br/>18. In April 2011, Bouteflika promised further constitutional and political reform.<br/>19. However, elections are routinely criticized by opposition groups as unfair and international human rights groups say that media censorship and harassment of political opponents continue.<br/>",11,What reforms did the programme comprise of>,,

The tapes revealed several crucial conversations that took place between the President and his counsel, John Dean, on March 21, 1973.<br/>2. In this conversation, Dean summarized many aspects of the Watergate case, and focused on the subsequent coverup, describing it as a ""cancer on the presidency.""<br/>3. The burglary team was being paid hush money for their silence and Dean stated: ""That's the most troublesome post-thing, because Bob is involved in that; John [Ehrlichman is involved in that; I am involved in that; Mitchell is involved in that.<br/>4. And that's an obstruction of justice.""<br/>5. Dean continues and states that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the White House, demanding money immediately, and President Nixon replies that the blackmail money should be paid: ""…just looking at the immediate problem, don't you have to have – handle Hunt's financial situation damn soon?<br/>6. […] you've got to keep the cap on the bottle that much, in order to have any options.<br/>7. ""At the time of the initial congressional impeachment, it was not known if Nixon had known and approved of the payments to the Watergate defendants earlier than this conversation.<br/>8. Nixon's conversation with Haldeman on August 1, 1972, is one of several that establishes this.<br/>9. Nixon states: ""Well…they have to be paid.<br/>10. That's all there is to that.<br/>11. They have to be paid.""<br/>12. During the congressional debate on impeachment, some believed that impeachment required a criminally indictable offense.<br/>13. President Nixon's agreement to make the blackmail payments was regarded as an affirmative act to obstruct justice.On December 7, 1973, it was found that an 18½ minute portion of one recorded tape had been erased.<br/>14. Nixon's longtime personal secretary, Rose Mary Woods, said she had accidentally erased the tape by pushing the wrong pedal on her tape player when answering the phone.<br/>15. The press ran photos showing that it was unlikely for Woods to answer the phone and keep her foot on the pedal.<br/>16. Later forensic analysis determined that the tape had been erased in several segments – at least five, and perhaps as many as nine.<br/>",1,What did the tapes reveal?,,

MRI and computed tomography (CT) are complementary imaging technologies and each has advantages and limitations for particular applications.<br/>2. CT is more widely used than MRI in OECD countries with a mean of 132 vs 46 exams per 1000 population performed respectively.<br/>3. A concern is the potential for CT to contribute to radiation-induced cancer and in 2007 it was estimated that 0.4% of current cancers in the United States were due to CTs performed in the past, and that in the future this figure may rise to 1.5–2% based on historical rates of CT usage.<br/>4. An Australian study found that one in every 1800 CT scans was associated with an excess cancer.<br/>5. An advantage of MRI is that no ionizing radiation is used and so it is recommended over CT when either approach could yield the same diagnostic information.<br/>6. However, although the cost of MRI has fallen, making it more competitive with CT, there are not many common imaging scenarios in which MRI can simply replace CT, although this substitution has been suggested for the imaging of liver disease.<br/>7. The effect of low doses of radiation on carcinogenesis are also disputed.<br/>8. Although MRI is associated with biological effects, these have not been proven to cause measurable harm.<br/>9. In a comparison of possible genotoxic effects of MRI compared with those of CT scans, Knuuti et al.<br/>10. noted that although previous studies have demonstrated DNA damage associated with MRI, ""the long-term biological and clinical significance of DNA double-strand breaks induced by MRI remains unknown"".Iodinated contrast medium is routinely used in CT and the main adverse events are anaphylactoid reactions and nephrotoxicity.<br/>11. Commonly used MRI contrast agents have a good safety profile but linear non-ionic agents in particular have been implicated in nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with severely impaired renal function.MRI is contraindicated in the presence of MR-unsafe implants, and although these patients may be imaged with CT, beam hardening artefact from metallic devices, such as pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, may also affect image quality.<br/>12. MRI is a longer investigation than CT and an exam may take between 20 - 40 mins depending on complexity.<br/>",8,Is MRI harmful?,,

Early modern history (1536–1849).After Sweden permanently broke away from the Kalmar Union in 1523, Denmark tried on two occasions to reassert control over Sweden.<br/>2. The first was in the Northern Seven Years' War which lasted from 1563 until 1570.<br/>3. The second occasion was the Kalmar War when King Christian IV attacked Sweden in 1611 but failed to accomplish his main objective of forcing Sweden to return to the union with Denmark.<br/>4. The war led to no territorial changes, but Sweden was forced to pay a war indemnity of 1 million silver riksdaler to Denmark, an amount known as the ""Älvsborg ransom"".King Christian used this money to found several towns and fortresses, most notably Glückstadt (founded as a rival to Hamburg), Christiania (following a fire destroying the original city of Oslo), Christianshavn, Christianstad, and Christiansand.<br/>5. Christian also constructed a number of buildings, most notably Børsen, Rundetårn, Nyboder, Rosenborg, a silver mine, and a copper mill.<br/>6. Inspired by the Dutch East India Company, he founded a similar Danish company and planned to claim Ceylon as a colony, but the company only managed to acquire Tranquebar on India's Coromandel Coast.<br/>7. Denmark's large colonial aspirations were limited to a few key trading posts in Africa and India.In the Thirty Years' War, Christian tried to become the leader of the Lutheran states in Germany but suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Lutter.<br/>8. The result was that the Catholic army under Albrecht von Wallenstein was able to invade, occupy, and pillage Jutland, forcing Denmark to withdraw from the war.<br/>9. Denmark managed to avoid territorial concessions, but Gustavus Adolphus' intervention in Germany was seen as a sign that the military power of Sweden was on the rise while Denmark's influence in the region was declining.<br/>10. Swedish armies invaded Jutland in 1643 and claimed Skåne in 1644.<br/>11. According to Geoffrey Parker, ""The Swedish occupation caused a drop in agricultural production and a shortage of capital; harvest failure and plague ravaged the land between 1647 and 1651; Denmark's population fell by 20 per cent.<br/>12. ""In the 1645 Treaty of Brømsebro, Denmark surrendered Halland, Gotland, the last parts of Danish Estonia, and several provinces in Norway.<br/>13. In 1657, King Frederick III declared war on Sweden and marched on Bremen-Verden.<br/>14. This led to a massive Danish defeat and the armies of King Charles X Gustav of Sweden conquered both Jutland, Funen, and much of Zealand before signing the Peace of Roskilde in February 1658 which gave Sweden control of Skåne, Blekinge, Trøndelag, and the island of Bornholm.<br/>15. Charles X Gustav quickly regretted not having destroyed Denmark completely and in August 1658 he began a two-year long siege of Copenhagen but failed to take the capital.<br/>16. In the following peace settlement, Denmark managed to maintain its independence and regain control of Trøndelag and Bornholm.Denmark tried to regain control of Skåne in the Scanian War (1675–79) but this attempt was a failure.<br/>17. Following the Great Northern War (1700–21), Denmark managed to restore control of the parts of Schleswig and Holstein ruled by the house of Holstein-Gottorp in 1721 and 1773, respectively.<br/>18. In the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark originally tried to pursue a policy of neutrality and trade with both France and the United Kingdom and joined the League of Armed Neutrality with Russia, Sweden, and Prussia.<br/>19. The British considered this a hostile act and attacked Copenhagen in both 1801 and 1807, in one case carrying off the Danish fleet, in the other, burning large parts of Copenhagen.This led to the so-called Danish-British Gunboat War.<br/>20. The British control of the waterways between Denmark and Norway proved disastrous to the union's economy and in 1813, Denmark-Norway went bankrupt.<br/>21. The Danish-Norwegian union was dissolved by the Treaty of Kiel in 1814.<br/>22. Norway entered a new union with Sweden which lasted until 1905.<br/>23. Denmark kept the colonies of Iceland, Faroe Islands, and Greenland.<br/>24. Apart from the Nordic colonies, Denmark ruled over Danish India (Tranquebar in India) from 1620 to 1869, the Danish Gold Coast (Ghana) from 1658 to 1850, and the Danish West Indies (the U.S. Virgin Islands) from 1671 to 1917.<br/>",2,When was the Northern Seven Years War?,,

Box lacrosse is played by teams of six on a hockey rink where the ice has been removed or covered by artificial turf, or in an indoor soccer or lacrosse field.<br/>2. The enclosed playing area is called a box, in contrast to the open playing field of the traditional game.<br/>3. This version of the game was introduced in the 1930s to promote business for hockey arenas, and within several years had nearly supplanted field lacrosse in Canada.Box lacrosse is played at the highest level by the ""Senior A"" divisions of the Canadian Lacrosse Association and the National Lacrosse League (NLL).<br/>4. The National Lacrosse League employs some minor rule changes from the Canadien Lacrosse Association (CLA) rules.<br/>5. Notably, the games are played during the winter.<br/>6. The NLL games consist of four fifteen-minute quarters compared with three periods of twenty minutes each (similar to ice hockey) in CLA games (multiple 15-minute OT periods for tied games, until whoever scores first).<br/>7. NLL players may use only sticks with hollow shafts, while CLA permits solid wooden sticks.<br/>8. :The goals in box lacrosse are much smaller than field lacrosse, traditionally wide by tall in box, and wide by tall in the NLL.<br/>9. Also, the goaltender wears much more protective padding, including a massive chest protector and armguard combination known as ""uppers"", large shin guards known as leg pads (both of which must follow strict measurement guidelines), and ice hockey-style masks or lacrosse helmets.<br/>10. Also, at the professional level, box lacrosse goaltenders often use traditional wooden sticks outside of the NLL, which does not allow wooden sticks.<br/>11. This makes Box Lacrosse faster and rougher than the traditional Field Lacrosse.The style of the game is quick, accelerated by the close confines of the floor and a shot clock.<br/>12. The shot clock requires the attacking team to take a shot on goal within 30 seconds of gaining possession of the ball.<br/>13. In addition, players must advance the ball from their own defensive end to the offensive side of the floor within 10 seconds.Box lacrosse is also a much more physical game.<br/>14. Since cross checking is legal in box lacrosse, players wear rib pads in addition to the shoulder and elbow pads that field lacrosse players wear.<br/>15. Box lacrosse players wear a different type of helmet as well, a hockey helmet with a box lacrosse cage.For most penalties, the offending player is sent to the penalty box and his team has to play without him (thus lacking one player) for a short amount of time.<br/>16. Most penalties last for two minutes, unless a five-minute major penalty has been assessed.<br/>17. What separates box lacrosse (and ice hockey) from other sports is that at the top levels of professional and junior lacrosse, a five-minute major penalty is given and the players are not ejected for participating in a fight.<br/>",1,What is box lacrosse?,,

The painting underwent examination and restoration again in 1992, at the Washington National Gallery Laboratories under the supervision of David Bull.The painting is in oil on a thin walnut wood panel, about thick, prepared with a layer of white gesso and a layer of brownish underpaint.<br/>4. The panel is in good condition apart from a break to the upper left side of the painting.<br/>5. Its size has never been altered, as indicated by a narrow unpainted strip on all four sides of the painting.The background was thinly overpainted with unmodulated black, probably between 1830 and 1870, when the damaged corner was restored.<br/>6. Eugène Delacroix was suggested to have painted the background.<br/>7. Its previous colour was a bluish grey.<br/>8.

The romantic tradition that originated with Luo Guanzhong's historical novel ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" differs from historical accounts in many details.<br/>2. For example, Cao Cao's army strength was exaggerated to over 830,000 men.<br/>3. This may be attributed to the ethos of later times, particularly of the Southern Song Dynasty .<br/>4. The state of Shu Han, in particular, was viewed by later literati as the ""legitimate"" successor to the Han Dynasty, so fictionalised accounts assign greater prominence than the historical records warrant to the roles of Liu Bei, Zhuge Liang and other heroes from Shu.<br/>5. This is generally accomplished by minimising the importance of Eastern Wu commanders and advisors such as Zhou Yu and Lu Su .<br/>6. While historical accounts describe Lu Su as a sensible advisor and Zhou Yu as an eminent military leader and ""generous, sensible and courageous"" man, ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" depicts Lu Su as unremarkable and Zhou Yu as cruel and cynical .<br/>7. Both are depicted as being inferior to Zhuge Liang in every respect .The romances added wholly fictional and fantastical elements to the historical accounts and these were repeated in popular plays and operas.<br/>8. Examples from the ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" include Zhuge Liang pretending to use magic to call forth favourable winds (that he had in fact predicted by astronomical observation) for the fire ship attack, his strategy of ""using straw boats to borrow arrows"", and Guan Yu capturing and releasing Cao Cao at Huarong Trail.<br/>9.

The pressure to fight from the Russian nobles and the Austrian commanders, however, was too strong, and the Allies adopted the plan of the Austrian Chief of Staff, Franz von Weyrother.<br/>5. This called for a main drive against the French right flank, which the Allies noticed was lightly guarded, and diversionary attacks against the French left.<br/>6.

Proteins are very large molecules – macro-biopolymers – made from monomers called ""amino acids"".<br/>2. There are 20 standard amino acids, each containing a carboxyl group, an amino group, and a side-chain (known as an ""R"" group).<br/>3. The ""R"" group is what makes each amino acid different, and the properties of the side-chains greatly influence the overall three-dimensional conformation of a protein.<br/>4. When amino acids combine, they form a special bond called a peptide bond through dehydration synthesis, and become a polypeptide, or protein.In order to determine whether two proteins are related, or in other words to decide whether they are homologous or not, scientists use sequence-comparison methods.<br/>5. Methods like Sequence Alignments and Structural Alignments are powerful tools that help scientists identify homologies between related molecules.The relevance of finding homologies among proteins goes beyond forming an evolutionary pattern of protein families.<br/>6. By finding how similar two protein sequences are, we acquire knowledge about their structure and therefore their function.<br/>",1,What are proteins?,,

The probability of the photoelectric effect occurring is measured by the cross section of interaction, σ.<br/>6. This has been found to be a function of the atomic number of the target atom and photon energy.<br/>7.

At the time El Greco was largely obscure and under-appreciated.<br/>3.

The four building campaigns (1664–1710).The first building campaign (1664–1668) commenced with the ""Plaisirs de l'Île enchantée"" (Pleasures of the Enchanted Island) of 1664, a fête that was held between 7 and 13 May 1664.<br/>2. The campaign involved alterations in the château and gardens to accommodate the 600 guests invited to the party.<br/>3. (Nolhac, 1899, 1901; Marie, 1968; Verlet, 1985).The second building campaign (1669–1672) was inaugurated with the signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which ended the War of Devolution.<br/>4. During this campaign, the château began to assume some of the appearance that it has today.<br/>5. The most important modification of the château was Le Vau's envelope of Louis XIII's hunting lodge.<br/>6. (Nolhac, 1901; Marie, 1972; Verlet, 1985).<br/>7. Significant to the design and construction of the ""grands appartements"" is that the rooms of both apartments are of the same configuration and dimensions – a hitherto unprecedented feature in French palace design.<br/>8. Both the ""grand appartement du roi"" and the ""grand appartement de la reine"" formed a suite of seven enfilade rooms.<br/>9. The decoration of the rooms, which was conducted under Le Brun's direction, depicted the ""heroic actions of the king"" and were represented in allegorical form by the actions of historical figures from the antique past (Alexander the Great, Augustus, Cyrus, etc.).<br/>10. (Berger, 1986; Félibien, 1674; Verlet, 1985).With the signing of the Treaty of Nijmegen in 1678, which ended the Dutch War, the third building campaign at Versailles began (1678–1684).<br/>11. Under the direction of the architect, Jules Hardouin-Mansart, the Palace of Versailles acquired much of the look that it has today.<br/>12. In addition to the Hall of Mirrors, Hardouin-Mansart designed the north and south wings and the ""Orangerie"".<br/>13. Le Brun was occupied not only with the interior decoration of the new additions of the palace, but also collaborated with Le Nôtre's in landscaping the palace gardens (Berger, 1985; Thompson, 2006; Verlet, 1985).Soon after the defeat of the War of the League of Augsburg (1688–1697), Louis XIV undertook his last building campaign at Versailles.<br/>14. The fourth building campaign (1699–1710) concentrated almost exclusively on construction of the royal chapel designed by Hardouin-Mansart and finished by Robert de Cotte.<br/>15. There were also some modifications in the ""appartement du roi"", namely the construction of the ""Salon de l'Œil de Bœuf"" and the King's Bedchamber.<br/>16. With the completion of the chapel in 1710, virtually all construction at Versailles ceased; building would not be resumed at Versailles until some twenty one years later during the reign of Louis XV (Nolhac, 1911; Marie, 1976, 1984; Verlet, 1985).<br/>",1,When was the first building campaign?,,

This so-called Jesse Tree shows Jesse lying prone and a tree growing from his side with the ancestors on each branch, in a visual treatment of a biblical verse.The figures in the lunettes appear to be families, but in every case they are families that are divided.<br/>3. The figures in them are physically divided by the name tablet but they are also divided by a range of human emotions that turn them outward or in on themselves and sometimes towards their partner with jealousy, suspicion, rage or simply boredom.<br/>4. In them Michelangelo has portrayed the anger and unhappiness of the human condition, painting ""the daily round of merely domestic life as if it were a curse"".<br/>5. In their constraining niches, the ancestors ""sit, squat and wait"".<br/>6. Of the fourteen lunettes, the two that were probably painted first, the families of Eleazar and Mathan and of Jacob and Joseph are the most detailed.<br/>7. They become progressively broader towards the altar end, one of the last being painted in only two days.<br/>8. The Eleazar and Mathan picture contains two figures with a wealth of costume detail that is not present in any other lunette.Prior to restoration, of all the paintings in the Sistine Chapel, the lunettes and spandrels were the dirtiest.<br/>9. Added to this, there has always been a problem of poor daytime visibility of the panels nearest the windows because of ""halination"".<br/>10.

Lee was carved onto the back of Lincoln's head, and looks back across the Potomac toward his former home, Arlington House, now within the bounds of Arlington National Cemetery.<br/>3. Another popular legend is that Lincoln is shown using sign language to represent his initials, with his left hand shaped to form an ""A"" and his right hand to form an ""L"", the president's initials.<br/>4. The National Park Service denies both legends.However, historian Gerald Prokopowicz writes that, while it is not clear that sculptor Daniel Chester French intended Lincoln's hands to be formed into sign language versions of his initials, it is possible that French did intend it, because he was familiar with American Sign Language, and he would have had a reason to do so, that is, to pay tribute to Lincoln for having signed the federal legislation giving Gallaudet University, a university for the deaf, the authority to grant college degrees.<br/>5. The National Geographic Society's publication, ""Pinpointing the Past in Washington, D.C."" states that Daniel Chester French had a son who was deaf and that the sculptor was familiar with sign language.<br/>6. Historian James A. Percoco has observed that, although there are no extant documents showing that French had Lincoln's hands carved to represent the letters ""A"" and ""L"" in American Sign Language, ""I think you can conclude that it's reasonable to have that kind of summation about the hands.""<br/>",2,What is one of the legends tied to the sculpture?,,

The dissolution and destruction of the monasteries and shrines was very unpopular in many areas.<br/>2. In the north of England, centering on Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, the suppression of the monasteries led to a popular rising, the Pilgrimage of Grace, that threatened the Crown for some weeks.<br/>3. In 1536 there were major, popular uprisings in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire and a further rising in Norfolk the following year.<br/>4. Rumours were spread that the King was going to strip the parish churches too, and even tax cattle and sheep.<br/>5. The rebels called for an end to the dissolution of the monasteries, for the removal of Cromwell, and for Henry's daughter, and eldest child, the Catholic Mary to be named as successor in place of his younger son, Edward.<br/>6. Henry defused the movement with solemn promises, all of which went unkept, and then summarily executed the leaders.However, when Mary succeeded to the throne in 1553, her hopes for a revival of English religious life proved a failure.<br/>7. Westminster Abbey, which had been retained as a cathedral, reverted to being a monastery; while the communities of the Bridgettine nuns and of the Observant Franciscans, which had gone into exile in the reign of Henry VIII, were able to return to their former houses at Syon and Greenwich respectively.<br/>8. A small group of fifteen surviving Carthusians was re-established in their old house at Sheen, as also were eight Dominican canonesses in Dartford.<br/>9. A house of Dominican friars was established at Smithfield, but this was only possible through importing professed religious from Holland and Spain, and Mary's hopes of further refoundations foundered, as she found it very difficult to persuade former monks and nuns to resume the religious life; consequently schemes for restoring the abbeys at Glastonbury and St Albans failed for lack of volunteers.<br/>10. All the refounded houses were in properties that had remained in Crown possession; but, in spite of much prompting, none of Mary's lay supporters would co-operate in returning their holdings of monastic lands to religious use; while the lay lords in Parliament proved unremittingly hostile, as a revival of the ""mitred"" abbeys would have returned the House of Lords to having an ecclesiastical majority.<br/>11. Moreover, there remained a widespread suspicion that the return of religious communities to their former premises might call into question the legal title of lay purchasers of monastic land, and accordingly all Mary's foundations were technically new communities in law.<br/>12. In 1554 Cardinal Pole, the Papal Legate, negotiated a papal dispensation allowing the new owners to retain the former monastic lands, and in return Parliament enacted the heresy laws in January 1555.<br/>13. When Mary died and was succeeded by her sister Elizabeth, five of the six revived communities left again to exile in continental Europe.<br/>14. An Act of Elizabeth's first parliament dissolved the refounded houses; but although Elizabeth offered to allow the monks in Westminster to remain in place with restored pensions if they took the Oath of Supremacy and conformed to the new Book of Common Prayer, all refused and dispersed unpensioned.<br/>15. In less than 20 years, the monastic impulse had effectively been extinguished in England; and was only revived, even amongst Catholics, in the very different form of the new and reformed counter-reformation orders, such as the Jesuits.<br/>",13,What happened when Mary died?,,

The tracks are numbered according to their location in the terminal building.<br/>2. The upper level tracks are numbered 11 to 42 east to west.<br/>3. Tracks 22 and 31 were removed in the late 1990s to build concourses for Grand Central North, track 12 was removed to expand the platform between tracks 11 and 13, and track 14 is only used for loading a garbage train.The lower level has 27 tracks, numbered 100 to 126, east to west, though only tracks 102–112, and 114–116 are currently used for passenger service.<br/>4. Often, local and off-peak trains depart from the lower level while express, super-express, and peak trains depart from the main concourse.<br/>5. Odd numbered tracks are usually on the east side (right side facing north) of the platform; even numbered tracks on the west.The public timetables for April 3, 2011 show 286 weekday departures: 74 Hudson, 101 Harlem and 111 New Haven Line.Besides platforms, Grand Central has restaurants, such as the Oyster Bar and various fast food outlets surrounding the Dining Concourse on the level below the Main Concourse, as well as delis, bakeries, newsstands, a gourmet and fresh food market, an annex of the New York Transit Museum, and more than forty retail stores.<br/>6.

Other chain stores anticipated to open in the future include a Shake Shack.A ""secret"" sub-basement known as M42 lies under the Terminal, containing the AC to DC converters used to supply DC traction current to the Terminal.<br/>9. The exact location of M42 is a closely guarded secret and does not appear on maps, though it has been shown on television, most notably, the History Channel program ""Cities of the Underworld"" and also a National Geographic special.<br/>10. The original rotary converters were not removed in the late 20th century when solid-state ones took over their job, and they remain as a historical record.<br/>11. During World War II, this facility was closely guarded because its sabotage would have greatly impaired troop movement on the Eastern Seaboard.<br/>12. However, Abwehr (a German espionage service) was aware of it and sent two spies to sabotage it.<br/>13. The spies were arrested by the FBI before they could strike.<br/>14. It is said that any unauthorized person entering the facility during the war risked being shot on sight: the rotary converters used at the time could have easily been crippled by a bucket of sand.From 1924 through 1944, the attic of the east wing contained a art school and gallery space called the Grand Central School of Art.<br/>",13,What happened to the spies before they could strike?,,

In the physical sciences, subatomic particles are particles smaller than atoms.<br/>2. (although some subatomic particles have mass greater than some atoms).<br/>3. There are two types of subatomic particles: elementary particles, which according to current theories are not made of other particles; and ""composite"" particles.<br/>4. Particle physics and nuclear physics study these particles and how they interact.In particle physics, the concept of a particle is one of several concepts inherited from classical physics.<br/>5. But it also reflects the modern understanding that at the quantum scale matter and energy behave very differently from what much of everyday experience would lead us to expect.The idea of a particle underwent serious rethinking in light of experiments that showed that light could behave like a stream of particles (called photons) as well as exhibit wave-like properties.<br/>6. This led to the new concept of wave–particle duality to reflect that quantum-scale ""particles"" behave like both particles and waves.<br/>7. Another new concept, the uncertainty principle, states that such their properties as position and momentum cannot be measured exactly.<br/>8. In more recent times, wave–particle duality has been shown to apply not only to photons but to increasingly massive particles.Interactions of particles in the framework of quantum field theory are understood as creation and annihilation of ""quanta"" of corresponding fundamental interactions.<br/>9. This blends particle physics with field theory.<br/>",6,What is wave-particle duality?,,

Before the arrival of European settlers, the region was part of the homeland of the Cherokees.<br/>2. Frontierspeople began settling the land in the 18th and early 19th century.<br/>3. In 1830 President Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, beginning the process that eventually resulted in the forced removal of all Indian tribes east of the Mississippi River to what is now Oklahoma.<br/>4. Many of the Cherokee left, but some, led by renegade warrior Tsali, hid out in the area that is now the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.<br/>5. Some of their descendants now live in the Qualla Boundary to the south of the park.As white settlers arrived, logging grew as a major industry in the mountains, and a rail line, the Little River Railroad, was constructed in the late-19th Century to haul timber out of the remote regions of the area.<br/>6. Cut-and-run-style clearcutting was destroying the natural beauty of the area, so visitors and locals banded together to raise money for preservation of the land.<br/>7. The U.S. National Park Service wanted a park in the eastern United States, but did not have much money to establish one.<br/>8. Though Congress had authorized the park in 1926, there was no nucleus of federally owned land around which to build a park.<br/>9. John D. Rockefeller, Jr., contributed $5 million, the U.S. government added $2 million, and private citizens from Tennessee and North Carolina pitched in to assemble the land for the park, piece by piece.<br/>10. Slowly, mountain homesteaders, miners, and loggers were evicted from the land.<br/>11. Farms and timbering operations were abolished to establish the protected areas of the park.<br/>12. Travel writer Horace Kephart, for whom Mount Kephart was named, and photographer George Masa were instrumental in fostering the development of the park.<br/>13. Former Governor Ben W. Hooper of Tennessee was the principal land purchasing agent for the park, which was officially established on June 15, 1934.<br/>14. During the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Works Progress Administration, and other federal organizations made trails, fire watchtowers, and other infrastructure improvements to the park and Smoky Mountains.It was also a site for filming of parts of Disney's hit 1950s TV series, ""Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier"".This park was designated an International Biosphere Reserve in 1976, was certified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, and became a part of the Southern Appalachian Biosphere Reserve in 1988.A 75th anniversary re-dedication ceremony was held on September 2, 2009.<br/>15.

In 1975, following increasing sectarian tensions, a full-scale civil war broke out in Lebanon.<br/>2. The Lebanese Civil War pitted a coalition of Christian groups against the joint forces of the PLO, left-wing Druze and Muslim militias.<br/>3. In June 1976 Syria sent in its own troops, ostensibly to restore peace.<br/>4. In October 1976 the Arab League agreed to establish a predominantly Syrian Arab Deterrent Force, which was charged with restoring calm.In 1982, the PLO presence in Lebanon led to an Israeli invasion.<br/>5. A multinational force of American, French and Italian contingents (joined in 1983 by a British contingent) were deployed in Beirut after the Israeli siege of the city, to supervise the evacuation of the PLO.<br/>6. It returned in September 1982 after the assassination of Bashir Gemayel and subsequent fighting, during which a number of massacres were committed, such as in Damour, in Sabra and Shatila, and in several refugee camps.<br/>7. The multinational force was withdrawn in the spring of 1984, following a devastating bombing attack during the previous year.According to a videotape released by Osama Bin Laden in 2004, images of the bombing of Lebanon were what made him conceive the attack on the United States on the 11th of September 2001, in order to deter further attacks resulting in the deaths of women and children.In September 1988, the Parliament failed to elect a successor to President Gemayel as a result of differences between the Christians and the Muslims and Syrians.<br/>8. The Arab League Summit of May 1989 led to the formation of a Saudi-Moroccan-Algerian committee to solve the crisis.<br/>9. On 16 September 1989 the committee issued a peace plan which was accepted by all.<br/>10. A ceasefire was established, the ports and airports were re-opened and refugees began to return.In the same month, the Lebanese Parliament agreed to the Taif Agreement, which included an outline timetable for Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon and a formula for the de-confessionalisation of the Lebanese political system.<br/>11. The war ended at the end of 1990 after sixteen years, resulting in massive loss of human life and property, while devastating the country's economy.<br/>12.

The plan would include nearly double the current parking and a replacement theater with a greater capacity.<br/>3. At the time of the announcement, a price tag of $2 billion was announced.<br/>4. No concrete progress was made on those proposals, as the financial condition of the Pier suffered with the recession.Following the reorganization of the agency that runs Navy Pier and McCormick Place, a new study was commissioned to reinvigorate the upgrade process.<br/>5. The new study, by the Urban Land Institute, was released on November 11, 2010, and recommended a more modest set of enhancements aimed at retaining the Pier's role as a public space, rather than turning it into a theme park.<br/>6. Suggested elements include a concert venue, an enlarged Chicago Shakespeare Theater space, new restaurants, a renovated commercial area around the Pier's entrance, and additional park-like features to bring people closer to the lake.<br/>7. More grandiose possibilities, including the enlarged Ferris wheel and a hotel, are mentioned as more remote possibilities.In March 2012 a competition led to selection of a design concept presented by a team led by James Corner of James Corner Field Operations that focuses on the Pier's role as a waterfront promenade.<br/>8. In 2013 the Authority announced plans to carry out the first elements of a streamlined version of that concept, with reworked streetscape and a wider pedestrian space, moving tour-boat moorings to improve the view from a new central stairway centered on the Ferris wheel.<br/>9.

In any case, it is probably not meant as a conventional portrait.The image is a tronie, the Dutch 17th-century description of a ‘head’ that was not meant to be a portrait.<br/>4. After the most recent restoration of the painting in 1994, the subtle color scheme and the intimacy of the girl’s gaze toward the viewer have been greatly enhanced.<br/>5. During the restoration, it was discovered that the dark background, today somewhat mottled, was initially intended by the painter to be a deep enamel-like green.<br/>6. This effect was produced by applying a thin transparent layer of paint, called a glaze, over the present-day black background.<br/>7. However, the two organic pigments of the green glaze, indigo and weld, have faded.<br/>8. On the advice of Victor de Stuers, who for years tried to prevent Vermeer's rare works from being sold to parties abroad, Arnoldus Andries des Tombe purchased the work at an auction in The Hague in 1881, for only two guilders and thirty cents.<br/>9. At the time, it was in poor condition.<br/>10. Des Tombe had no heirs and donated this and other paintings to the Mauritshuis in 1902.In 1937, a very similar painting, ""Smiling Girl"", at the time also thought to be by Vermeer, was donated by collector Andrew W. Mellon to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Now widely considered to be a fake, the painting was claimed by Vermeer expert Arthur Wheelock in a 1995 study to be by 20th-century artist and forger Theo van Wijngaarden, a friend of Han van Meegeren.As part of a traveling exhibition while the Mauritshuis undertook construction, in 2012 the painting was exhibited in Japan at the National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo, and in 2013-2014 the United States, where it was shown at the High Museum in Atlanta, the de Young Museum in San Francisco and in New York City at the Frick Collection.<br/>11.

The Act of 1539 also provided for the suppression of religious hospitals; which had constituted in England a distinct class of institution, endowed for the purpose of caring for older people.<br/>2. A very few of these, such as Saint Bartholomew's Hospital in London, were excepted by special royal dispensation, but most closed, their residents being discharged with small pensions.<br/>3. Monasteries had also supplied free food and alms for the poor and destitute, and it has been argued that the removal of this and other charitable resources, amounting to about 5% of net monastic income, was one of the factors in the creation of the army of ""sturdy beggars"" that plagued late Tudor England, causing the social instability that led to the Edwardian and Elizabethan Poor Laws.<br/>4. Monasteries had necessarily undertaken schooling for their novice members, which in the later medieval period had tended to extend to cover choristers and sometimes other younger scholars; and all this educational resource was lost with their dissolution.<br/>5. By contrast, where monasteries had provided grammar schools for older scholars, these were commonly refounded with enhanced endowments; some by royal command in connection to the newly re-established cathedral churches, others by private initiative.<br/>6. Monastic orders had maintained, for the education of their members, six colleges at the universities of Oxford or Cambridge; of which five survived as refoundations.<br/>7. Hospitals too were frequently to be re-endowed by private benefactors; and many new almshouses and charities were to be founded by the Elizabethan gentry and professional classes.<br/>8. Nevertheless, it has been estimated that only in 1580 did overall levels of charitable giving in England return to those before the dissolution.<br/>9. On the eve of the overthrow, the various monasteries owned approximately 2,000,000 acres (just under 8 100 km²), over 16 percent of England, with tens of thousands of tenant farmers working those lands; some of whom had family ties to a particular monastery going back many generations.<br/>",1,What did the Act of 1539 provide?,,

Both German and Soviet casualties during the battle of Moscow have been a subject of debate, as various sources provide somewhat different estimates.<br/>2. Not all historians agree on what should be considered the ""Battle of Moscow"" in the timeline of World War II.<br/>3. While the start of the battle is usually regarded as the beginning of Operation ""Typhoon"" on 30 September 1941 (or sometimes on 2 October 1941), there are two different dates for the end of the offensive.<br/>4. In particular, some sources (such as Erickson and Glantz) exclude the Rzhev offensive from the scope of the battle, considering it as a distinct operation and making the Moscow offensive ""stop"" on 7 January 1942—thus lowering the number of casualties.<br/>5. Other historians, who include the Rzhev and Vyazma operations in the scope of the battle (thus making the battle end in May 1942), give higher casualty numbers.There are also significant differences in figures from various sources.<br/>6. John Erickson, in his ""Barbarossa: The Axis and the Allies"", gives a figure of 653,924 Soviet casualties between October 1941 and January 1942.<br/>7. Glantz, in his book ""When Titans Clashed"", gives a figure of 658,279 for the defense phase alone, plus 370,955 for the winter counteroffensive until 7 January 1942.<br/>8. The estimate of 400,000 German casualties by January 1942 reported in the ""Great Soviet Encyclopedia"", published in 1973–1978, is clearly inflated.<br/>9. A much more accurate estimate is provided in the ""Moscow Encyclopedia"", published in 1997; its authors, based on various sources, give a figure of 145,000 German and 900,000 Soviet casualties for the defensive phase, along with 103,000 German and 380,000 Soviet casualties for the counteroffensive until 7 January 1942.<br/>10. Many of the Soviet casualties, however, consisted of captured men.<br/>11. On the other hand, Wehrmacht daily casualty reports show 35,757 killed in action, 128,716 wounded, and 9,721 missing in action for the entire Army Group Center between 1 October 1941 and 10 January 1942.<br/>12. Therefore, total casualties between 30 September 1941, and 7 January 1942, are estimated to be between 174,000 and 248,000 for the ""Wehrmacht"" (Wehrmacht reports / Moscow encyclopedia estimate) and between 650,000 and 1,280,000 for the Red Army (Erickson / Moscow encyclopedia estimate).Regardless of these disagreements, the Battle of Moscow is considered among the most lethal battles in world history.<br/>",12,What was the estimated total of casualties?,,

Cooper's performance in ""Wedding Crashers"" impressed Russell, who noted his ""good bad-guy energy"", saying ""You're not sure where he's coming from.""<br/>4. Cooper told Russell ""he had been heavier and angrier and more fearful"" at the time of that performance and had drawn on those feelings for it.<br/>5.

Tiffany went through several iterations.<br/>11. She was initially meant to be a goth.<br/>12. Lawrence dyed her hair black and did test shoots in heavy goth makeup, but Harvey Weinstein balked at this.<br/>13. The character remained messed-up yet confident, with small goth touches such as the dark hair and a cross.<br/>14. To her surprise Russell asked Lawrence to put on weight for the role.<br/>15. Russell also convinced her to speak in a lower register, despite Lawrence thinking her naturally low voice makes her sound like a ""chain-smoking hermit.<br/>16.

The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp is a 1632 oil painting on canvas by Rembrandt housed in the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague, the Netherlands.<br/>2. Dr. Nicolaes Tulp is pictured explaining the musculature of the arm to medical professionals.<br/>3. Some of the spectators are various doctors who paid commissions to be included in the painting.<br/>4. The painting is signed in the top-left hand corner ""Rembrant.<br/>5. f 1632"".<br/>6. This may be the first instance of Rembrandt signing a painting with his forename (in its original form) as opposed to the monogramme ""RHL"" (Rembrant Harmenszoon of Leiden), and is thus a sign of his growing artistic confidence.The event can be dated to 16 January 1632: the Amsterdam Guild of Surgeons, of which Tulp was official City Anatomist, permitted only one public dissection a year, and the body would have to be that of an executed criminal.Anatomy lessons were a social event in the 17th century, taking place in lecture rooms that were actual theatres, with students, colleagues and the general public being permitted to attend on payment of an entrance fee.<br/>7. The spectators are appropriately dressed for a solemn social occasion.<br/>8. It is thought that the uppermost (not holding the paper) and farthest left figures were added to the picture later.<br/>9. One person is missing: the Preparator, whose task it was to prepare the body for the lesson.<br/>10. In the 17th century an important scientist such as Dr. Tulp would not be involved in menial and bloody work like dissection, and such tasks would be left to others.<br/>11. It is for this reason that the picture shows no cutting instruments.<br/>12. Instead we see in the lower right corner an enormous open textbook on anatomy, possibly the 1543 ""De humani corporis fabrica"" (""Fabric of the Human Body"") by Andreas Vesalius.Medical specialists have commented on the accuracy of muscles and tendons painted by the 26-year-old Rembrandt.<br/>13. It is not known where he obtained such knowledge; it is possible that he copied the details from an anatomical textbook.<br/>14. However, in 2006 Dutch researchers recreated the scene with a male cadaver, revealing several discrepancies of the exposed left forearm compared to that of a real corpse.<br/>15. The surgically astute will notice that the origin of the exposed forearm muscles would seem to indicate that the flexor compartment originates at the lateral epicondyle, when it is, in fact, the medial epicondyle.<br/>16. It is the common extensor origin that originates at the lateral epicondyle.<br/>17. In a 2007 study, the American artist and anatomist David J. Jackowe and his colleagues demonstrated that the mysterious white cord that courses along the ulnar aspect of the cadaver's carpus and little finger, long thought to be either an ulnar nerve variant or artistic error, is most likely the tendon of an anomalous forearm muscle, the accessory abductor digiti minimi. <br/>",6,How did Rembrandt typically sign his name on his paintings?,,

On that night, hundreds of thousands of people congregate to watch the Waterford Crystal ball being lowered on a pole atop the building, marking the start of the new year.<br/>4. It replaced a lavish fireworks display from the top of the building that was held from 1904 to 1906, but stopped by city officials because of the danger of fire.<br/>5. Beginning in 1908, and for more than eighty years thereafter, Times Square sign maker Artkraft Strauss was responsible for the ball-lowering.<br/>6. During World War II, a minute of silence, followed by a recording of church bells pealing, replaced the ball drop because of wartime blackout restrictions.<br/>7.

Longer infrared wavelengths can penetrate clouds of dust that block visible light, allowing the observation of young stars in molecular clouds and the cores of galaxies.<br/>4. Observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) have been particularly effective at unveiling numerous Galactic protostars and their host star clusters.<br/>5. With the exception of wavelengths close to visible light, infrared radiation is heavily absorbed by the atmosphere, or masked, as the atmosphere itself produces significant infrared emission.<br/>6. Consequently, infrared observatories have to be located in high, dry places or in space.<br/>7. Some molecules radiate strongly in the infrared.<br/>8.

Because most American butcheries cut ribs rib-eye style, instead of the thicker chunks of individual ribs South Koreans typically do in their own country, South Korean-owned restaurants in Los Angeles made galbi with these thinner cuts of beef with several ribs.<br/>13.

There the threat to its integrity was the most pronounced, and the need for reforms was most evident.<br/>3. When the revolt broke out, it was supported by intellectuals, the army, and almost all the ethnic minorities of the Empire, and forced Sultan Abdul Hamid II to re-adopt the long defunct Ottoman constitution of 1876, ushering in the Second Constitutional Era.<br/>4. Hopes were raised among the Balkan ethnicities of reforms and autonomy, and elections were held to form a representative, multi-ethnic, Ottoman parliament.<br/>5. However, following the Sultan's attempted counter-coup, the liberal element of the Young Turks was sidelined and the nationalist element became dominant.At the same time, in October 1908, Austria-Hungary seized the opportunity of the Ottoman political upheaval to annex the ""de jure"" Ottoman province of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which it had occupied since 1878 (see ""Bosnian Crisis""), and Bulgaria declared itself a fully independent kingdom.<br/>6.

Twenty years later, on August 28, 1983, crowds gathered again to mark the 20th Anniversary Mobilization for Jobs, Peace and Freedom, to reflect on progress in gaining civil rights for African Americans and to commit to correcting continuing injustices.<br/>7. The ""I Have a Dream"" speech is such a part of the Lincoln Memorial story, that the spot on which King stood, on the landing eighteen steps below Lincoln's statue, was engraved in 2003 in recognition of the 40th anniversary of the event.<br/>8. This engraving can be easy to miss unless one walks up the very center of the steps.<br/>9. The engraving is not large and the letters have not been painted in to make them more readable.At the memorial on May 9, 1970, President Richard Nixon had a middle-of-the-night impromptu, brief meeting with protesters who, just days after the Kent State shootings, were preparing to march against the Vietnam War.<br/>",7,When was the place Dr Martin Luther King Jr stood at the Lincoln memorial engraved?,,

John Grant is a middle-class teacher from the big city.<br/>2. He feels disgruntled because of the onerous terms of a financial bond which he signed with the government in return for receiving a tertiary education.<br/>3. The bond has forced him to accept a post to the tiny school at Tiboonda, a remote township in the arid Australian Outback.<br/>4. It is the start of the Christmas school holidays and Grant plans on going to Sydney to visit his girlfriend but first, however, he must travel by train to the nearby mining town of Bundanyabba (known as “The Yabba”) in order to catch a Sydney-bound flight.At ""The Yabba"", Grant encounters several disconcerting residents including a policeman, Jock Crawford, who encourages Grant to drink repeated glasses of beer before introducing him to the local obsession with the gambling game of two-up.<br/>5. Hoping to win enough money to pay off his bond and escape his ""slavery"" as an outback teacher, Grant at first has a winning streak playing two-up but then loses all his cash.<br/>6. Unable now to leave ""The Yabba"", Grant finds himself dependent on the charity of bullying strangers while being drawn into the crude and hard-drinking lifestyle of the town's residents.Grant reluctantly goes drinking with a resident named Tim Hynes (Al Thomas) and goes to Tim's house.<br/>7. Here he meets Tim's daughter, Janette.<br/>8. While he and Janette talk, several men who have gathered at the house for a drinking session question Grant's masculinity, asking: “What's the matter with him?<br/>9. He'd rather talk to a woman than drink beer.” Janette then tries to initiate an awkward sexual episode with Grant, who vomits.<br/>10. Grant finds refuge of a sort, staying at the shack of an alcoholic medical practitioner known as ""Doc"" Tydon.<br/>11. Doc tells him that he and many others have had sex with Janette.<br/>12. He also gives Grant pills from his medical kit, ostensibly to cure Grant's hangover.Later, a drunk Grant participates in a barbaric kangaroo hunt with Doc and Doc's friends Dick and Joe.<br/>13. The hunt culminates in Grant clumsily stabbing a wounded kangaroo to death, followed by a pointless drunken brawl between Dick and Joe and the vandalizing of a bush pub.<br/>14. At night's end, Grant returns to Doc's shack, where Doc apparently initiates a homosexual encounter between the two.A repulsed Grant leaves the next morning and walks across the desert.<br/>15. He tries to hitch-hike to Sydney, but accidentally boards a truck that takes him straight back to ""The Yabba"".<br/>16. He contemplates shooting Doc, but instead attempts suicide.<br/>17. Grant recovers in hospital from his suicide attempt and Doc sees him off at ""The Yabba's"" rail station.<br/>18. He returns to Tiboonda for the new school year.<br/>",3,What was Grant hoping to win enough money to pay off?,,

In 1890, Van Gogh's brother Theo was searching for a home for the artist upon his release from an asylum at Saint-Rémy.<br/>2. Upon the recommendation of Camille Pissarro, a former patient of the doctor who told Theo of Gachet's interests in working with artists, Theo sent Vincent to Gachet's second home in Auvers.Vincent van Gogh's first impression of Gachet was unfavorable.<br/>3.

Ireland has a wealth of structures, surviving in various states of preservation, from the Neolithic period, such as ""Brú na Bóinne"", Poulnabrone dolmen, Castlestrange stone, Turoe stone, and Drombeg stone circle.<br/>2. As the Romans never conquered Ireland, architecture of Greco-Roman origin is extremely rare.<br/>3. The country instead had an extended period of Iron Age architecture.<br/>4. The Irish round tower originated during the Early Medieval period.Christianity introduced simple monastic houses, such as Clonmacnoise, Skellig Michael and Scattery Island.<br/>5. A stylistic similarity has been remarked between these double monasteries and those of the Copts of Egypt.<br/>6. Gaelic kings and aristocrats occupied ringforts or ""crannógs"".<br/>7. Church reforms during the 12th century via the Cistercians stimulated continental influence, with the Romanesque styled Mellifont, Boyle and Tintern abbeys.<br/>8. Gaelic settlement had been limited to the Monastic proto-towns, such as Kells, where the current street pattern preserves the original circular settlement outline to some extent.<br/>9. Significant urban settlements only developed following the period of Viking invasions.<br/>10. The major Hiberno-Norse Longphorts were located on the coast, but with minor inland fluvial settlements, such as the eponymous Longford.Castles were built by the Normans during the late 12th century, such as Dublin Castle and Kilkenny Castle, and the concept of the planned walled trading town was introduced, which gained legal status and several rights by grant of a Charter under Feudalism.<br/>11. These charters specifically governed the design of these towns.<br/>12. Two significant waves of planned town formation followed, the first being the 16th and 17th century plantation towns, which were used as a mechanism for the Tudor English kings to suppress local insurgency, followed by 18th century landlord towns.<br/>13. Surviving Norman founded planned towns include Drogheda and Youghal; plantation towns include Portlaoise and Portarlington; well-preserved 18th century planned towns include Westport and Ballinasloe.<br/>14. These episodes of planned settlement account for the majority of present day towns throughout the country.Gothic cathedrals, such as St Patrick's, were also introduced by the Normans.<br/>15. Franciscans were dominant in directing the abbeys by the Late Middle Ages, while elegant tower houses, such as Bunratty Castle, were built by the Gaelic and Norman aristocracy.<br/>16. Many religious buildings were ruined with the Dissolution of the Monasteries.<br/>17. Following the Restoration, palladianism and rococo, particularly country houses, swept through Ireland under the initiative of Edward Lovett Pearce, with the Houses of Parliament being the most significant.With the erection of buildings such as The Custom House, Four Courts, General Post Office and King's Inns, the neoclassical and Georgian styles flourished, especially in Dublin.<br/>18. Georgian townhouses produced streets of singular distinction, particularly in Dublin, Limerick and Cork.<br/>19. Following Catholic Emancipation, cathedrals and churches influenced by the French Gothic Revival emerged, such as St Colman's and St Finbarre's.<br/>20. Ireland has long been associated with thatched roof cottages, though these are nowadays considered quaint.Beginning with the American designed art deco church at Turner's Cross in 1927, Irish architecture followed the international trend towards modern and sleek building styles since the 20th century.<br/>21. Recent developments include the regeneration of Ballymun and an urban extension of Dublin at Adamstown.<br/>22. Since the establishment of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority in 1997, the Dublin Docklands area underwent large-scale redevelopment, which included the construction of the Convention Centre Dublin and Grand Canal Theatre.<br/>23. Completed in 2008, the Elysian tower in Cork is the tallest storeyed building in Ireland, at a height of , surpassing Cork County Hall.<br/>24. The Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland regulates the practice of architecture in the state.<br/>",23,When was the Elysian tower completed?,,

Bison (""Bison bison"") have been kept in Golden Gate Park since 1891, when a small herd was purchased by the park commission.<br/>2. At the time, the animal's population in North America had dwindled to an all-time low, and San Francisco made a successful effort to breed them in captivity.<br/>3. In 1899, the paddock in the western section of the park was created.<br/>4. At its peak and through a successful captive breeding program, more than 100 calves were produced at Golden Gate Park, helping preserve the iconic bison population numbers in North America, which has been critical to the culture and livelihood of Native Americans.In 1984, Mayor Dianne Feinstein's husband, Richard C. Blum, purchased a new herd as a birthday present for his wife.<br/>5. The older bison in the paddock today are descendants of those animals.In December 2011, after the number of bison in the paddock had dwindled to three, Assemblywoman Fiona Ma’s office led another preservation effort.<br/>6. With donations from the Theodore Rosen Charitable Foundation, Richard C.

The centerpiece of the exhibit was the ""Enola Gay"", the B-29 bomber that dropped the A-bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.<br/>3. Veterans' groups, led by the Air Force Association and The Retired Officers Association, argued strongly that the exhibit's inclusion of Japanese accounts and photographs of victims politicized the exhibit and insulted U.S. airmen.<br/>4. Also disputed was the predicted number of U.S. casualties that would have resulted from an invasion of Japan, had that been necessary, after the museum director, Martin O. Harwit, unilaterally reduced the figure by 75% on January 9, 1995, at the height of the dispute.<br/>5.

Although the exhibit was ""radically reduced"" and criticized by the ""New York Times"" as ""the most diminished display in Smithsonian history,"" the Air and Space Museum placed the forward fuselage of the ""Enola Gay"" and other items on display as part of a non-political historical exhibition.<br/>8. Within a year, it had drawn more than a million visitors, making it the most popular special exhibition in the history of the NASM, and when the exhibition closed in May 1998, it had drawn nearly four million visitors.On October 8, 2011, the museum was temporarily closed after demonstrators associated with the Occupy D.C. demonstration attempted to enter the museum.<br/>9.

The pose of Michelangelo's David is unlike that of earlier Renaissance depictions of ""David"".<br/>2. The bronze statues of David by Donatello and Verrocchio had both represented the hero standing victorious over the head of Goliath, the painter Andrea del Castagno had shown the boy in mid-swing, even as Goliath's head rested between his feet, but no earlier Florentine artist had omitted the giant altogether.<br/>3. According to Helen Gardner and other scholars, David is depicted before his battle with Goliath.<br/>4. Instead of being shown victorious over a foe much larger than he, David looks tense and ready for combat.<br/>5. The statue appears to show David after he has made the decision to fight Goliath but before the battle has actually taken place, a moment between conscious choice and action.<br/>6. His brow is drawn, his neck tense and the veins bulge out of his lowered right hand.<br/>7. The twist of his body effectively conveys to the viewer the feeling that he is in motion, an impression heightened with contrapposto.<br/>8. The statue is a Renaissance interpretation of a common ancient Greek theme of the standing heroic male nude.<br/>9. In the High Renaissance, contrapposto poses were thought of as a distinctive feature of antique sculpture.<br/>10. This is typified in ""David"", as the figure stands with one leg holding its full weight and the other leg forward.<br/>11. This classic pose causes the figure’s hips and shoulders to rest at opposing angles, giving a slight s-curve to the entire torso.<br/>12. The contrapposto is emphasised by the turn of the head to the left, and by the contrasting positions of the arms.<br/>13. Michelangelo’s ""David"" has become one of the most recognized works of Renaissance sculpture, becoming a symbol of both strength and youthful human beauty.It was the colossal size of the statue that impressed Michelangelo's contemporaries, however.<br/>14. Vasari described it as ""certainly a miracle that of Michelangelo, to restore to life one who was dead,"" and then listed all of the largest and most grand of the ancient statues that he had ever seen, concluding that Michelangelo's work surpassed ""all ancient and modern statues, whether Greek or Latin, that have ever existed.""<br/>15. The proportions of the ""David"" are atypical of Michelangelo's work; the figure has an unusually large head and hands (particularly apparent in the right hand).<br/>16. These enlargements may be due to the fact that the statue was originally intended to be placed on the cathedral roofline, where the important parts of the sculpture would necessarily be accentuated in order to be visible from below.<br/>17. The statue is unusually slender (front to back) in comparison to its height.<br/>18. This may be the result of the work that had been done on the block before Michelangelo began carving it.It is possible that the ""David"" was conceived as a political statue before Michelangelo began to work on it.<br/>19. Certainly David the giant-killer had long been seen as a political figure in Florence, and images of the Biblical hero already carried political implications there.<br/>20. Donatello's bronze ""David,"" made for the Medici family, perhaps 1440, had been appropriated by the Signoria in 1494, when the Medici were exiled from Florence, and the statue was installed in the courtyard of the Palazzo della Signoria, where it stood for the Republican government of the city.<br/>21. By placing Michelangelo's statue in the same general location, the Florentine authorities ensured that ""David"" would be seen as a political parallel as well as an artistic response to that earlier work.Commentators have noted ""David""'s uncircumcised penis, which is at odds with Judaic practice, but is consistent with the conventions of Renaissance art.In 2008, plans were proposed to insulate the statue from the vibration of tourists' footsteps at Florence's Galleria dell'Accademia, to prevent damage to the marble.<br/>",15,What features of David are unusually large?,,

The most common type of snorkel is a simple tube that is allowed to flood when underwater.<br/>2. The snorkeler expels water from the snorkel either with a sharp exhalation on return to the surface (""blast clearing"") or by tilting the head back shortly before reaching the surface and exhaling until reaching or breaking the surface (""displacement method"") and facing forward again before inhaling the next breath.<br/>3. The displacement method expels water by displacing its presence in the snorkel with air; it is a technique that takes practice but clears the snorkel with less effort, but only works when surfacing.<br/>4. Clearing splash water while at the surface requires blast clearing.Some snorkels have a sump in the mouthpiece to allow a small volume of water to remain in the snorkel without being inhaled when the snorkeler breathes.<br/>5. Some also have a one-way output valve in the sump, which automatically drains the sump as it fills with water.<br/>6. A few snorkels have float-operated valves attached to the top end of the tube to keep water out when a wave passes, but these cause problems when diving as the snorkel must then be equalised during descent, using part of the diver's inhaled air supply.<br/>7. Some recent designs have a splash deflector on the top end that prevents entry of any water that splashes over the open end of the tube, thereby keeping it relatively free from water.Finswimmers usually don't use snorkels with a sump valve, as they learn to spit water out through the tube, allowing greater speed and lowering the stress of eventual swallowing of small quantities of water, which would impede their competition performance.There is actually a method to re-train former snorkelers to use sump valve, splash deflector and noseclip to become a proficient finswimmer.Common problem with all assistive mechanical clearing mechanisms is their tendency to fail if infrequently used, stored for long periods, environmental fouling, or due to lack of maintenance.Modern designs use silicone rubber in the mouthpiece and one-way clearing and float valves due to its resistance to degradation and its long service life.<br/>8. Natural rubber was formerly used, but slowly oxidizes and breaks down due to ultraviolet light exposure from the sun.<br/>9. It eventually loses its flexibility, becomes brittle and cracks, which can cause clearing valves to stick in the open or closed position, and float valves to leak due to a failure of the valve seat to seal.<br/>10. In even older designs, some snorkels were made with small ""ping pong"" balls in a cage mounted to the open end of the tube to prevent water ingress.<br/>11. These are no longer sold or recommended because they are unreliable and considered hazardous.<br/>12. Similarly, diving masks with a built-in snorkel are considered unsafe and obsolete.Application of a grease to valve seats can aid in sealing, but is mechanically washed away over time.<br/>13. A heavy application can cause valves to stick closed and trap grit (foul), which will cause the valve to leak.Environmental fouling can be caused by beach sand or loose-floating plant or animal matter becoming lodged in the valve, preventing proper operation.Although swimming with a snorkel is much easier than without, it is important that a novice swimmer also learn surface breathing and floating without a snorkel, in the event that the clearing mechanisms fail, rendering the snorkel useless as a breathing aid.<br/>",1,What is the most common type of snorkel like?,,

Squash's use of stringed racquets is shared with tennis, which dates from the late sixteenth century, though is more directly descended from the game of racquets from England.<br/>2. In ""racquets"", instead of hitting over a net as in tennis, players hit a squeezable ball against walls.Squash was invented in Harrow School out of the older game racquets around 1830 before the game spread to other schools, eventually becoming an international sport.<br/>3. The first courts built at this school were rather dangerous because they were near water pipes, buttresses, chimneys, and ledges.<br/>4. The school soon built four outside courts.<br/>5. Natural rubber was the material of choice for the ball.<br/>6. Students modified their racquets to have a smaller reach to play in these cramped conditions.The racquets have changed in much the same way as those used in tennis.<br/>7. Squash racquets used to be made out of laminated timber.<br/>8. In the 1980s, construction shifted to lighter, carbon-based materials (such as graphite) with small additions of such components as Kevlar, boron and titanium.<br/>9. Natural ""gut"" strings were replaced with synthetic strings.In the 19th century the game increased in popularity with various schools, clubs and even private citizens building squash courts, but with no set dimensions.<br/>10. The first squash court in North America appeared at St. Paul's School in New Hampshire in 1884.<br/>11. In 1904 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the earliest national association of squash in the world was formed as the United States Squash Racquets Association, (USSRA), now known as U.S.<br/>12. Squash.<br/>13. In April 1907 the Tennis, Racquets & Fives Association set up a sub committee to set standards for squash.<br/>14. Then the sport soon formed, combining the three sports together called “Squash”.<br/>15. In 1912 the Titanic had a squash court in first class.<br/>16. It was not until 1923 that the Royal Automobile Club hosted a meeting to further discuss the rules and regulations and another five years elapsed before the Squash Racquets Association was formed to set standards for squash in Great Britain.The sport spread to America and Canada, and eventually around the globe.<br/>17. It was founded in 1924 in New York as Metropolitan Racquets Association, or MSRA.<br/>",7,What were squash racquets made of before?,,

The ISS provides a platform to conduct scientific research that cannot be performed in any other way.<br/>2. While small unmanned spacecraft can provide platforms for zero gravity and exposure to space, space stations offer a long term environment where studies can be performed potentially for decades, combined with ready access by human researchers over periods that exceed the capabilities of manned spacecraft.The Station simplifies individual experiments by eliminating the need for separate rocket launches and research staff.<br/>3. The wide variety of research fields include astrobiology, astronomy, human research including space medicine and life sciences, physical sciences, materials science, space weather, and weather on Earth (meteorology).<br/>4. Scientists on Earth have access to the crew's data and can modify experiments or launch new ones, benefits generally unavailable on unmanned spacecraft.<br/>5.

On 3 April 2013, NASA scientists reported that hints of dark matter may have been detected by the ""Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer"".<br/>7. According to the scientists, ""The first results from the space-borne Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer confirm an unexplained excess of high-energy positrons in Earth-bound cosmic rays.<br/>8. ""The space environment is hostile to life.<br/>9. Unprotected presence in space is characterised by an intense radiation field (consisting primarily of protons and other subatomic charged particles from the solar wind, in addition to cosmic rays), high vacuum, extreme temperatures, and microgravity.<br/>10. Some simple forms of life called extremophiles, including small invertebrates called tardigrades can survive in this environment in an extremely dry state called desiccation.Medical research improves knowledge about the effects of long-term space exposure on the human body, including muscle atrophy, bone loss, and fluid shift.<br/>11. This data will be used to determine whether lengthy human spaceflight and space colonisation are feasible.<br/>12. As of 2006, data on bone loss and muscular atrophy suggest that there would be a significant risk of fractures and movement problems if astronauts landed on a planet after a lengthy interplanetary cruise, such as the six-month interval required to travel to Mars.Medical studies are conducted aboard the ISS on behalf of the National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI).<br/>13. Prominent among these is the Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity study in which astronauts perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts.<br/>14. The study considers the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions in space.<br/>15. Usually, there is no physician on board the ISS and diagnosis of medical conditions is a challenge.<br/>16.

Many of today's most interesting new buildings are made of wood, reflecting the strong appeal that this material continues to hold for Norwegian designers and builders.With Norway's conversion to Christianity some 1,000 years ago, churches were constructed.<br/>3. Stonework architecture was introduced from Europe for the most important structures, beginning with the construction of Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim.<br/>4. In the early Middle Ages, wooden stave churches were constructed throughout Norway.<br/>5. Many of them have survived and represent Norway's most unique contribution to architectural history.<br/>6. A fine example is Urnes Stave Church, which is now on UNESCO's World Heritage List.<br/>7. Another notable example of wooden architecture are buildings at the Bryggen Wharf in Bergen, consisting of a row of narrow wooden structures along the quayside.In the 17th century, under the Danish monarchy, cities and villages such as Kongsberg and Røros were established.<br/>8. The city had a church built in the Baroque style.<br/>9. Traditional wooden buildings were constructed in Røros which have survived changes since then.After Norway's union with Denmark was dissolved in 1814, Oslo became the capital.<br/>10. The architect Christian H. Grosch designed the earliest parts of the University of Oslo, the Oslo Stock Exchange, and many other buildings and churches constructed in that early national period.At the beginning of the 20th century, the city of Ålesund was rebuilt in the Art Nouveau style, influenced by styles of France.<br/>11. The 1930s, when functionalism dominated, became a strong period for Norwegian architecture.<br/>12. It is only since the late 20th century that Norwegian architects have achieved international renown.<br/>13. One of the most striking modern buildings in Norway is the Sami Parliament in Kárášjohka, designed by Stein Halvorson and Christian Sundby.<br/>14.

The making of rendang spreads from Minangkabau region to Mandailing, Riau, Jambi, across the strait to Malacca and Negeri Sembilan, resulting in a variety of rendang traditions.The popularity of rendang has spread widely from its original domain because of the ""merantau"" (migrating) culture of Minangkabau people.<br/>4. Overseas Minangkabau leave their hometown to start a career in other Indonesian cities as well as neighboring countries, and Padang restaurants, Minangkabau eating establishments that are ubiquitous in Indonesian cities, spring up.<br/>5. These Padang restaurants have introduced and popularized rendang and other Padang food dishes across Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the wider world.Andalas University historian, Prof. Gusti Asnan suggests that rendang began to spread across the region when Minangkabau merchants and migrant workers began to trade and migrate to Malacca in the 16th century.<br/>6. “Because the journey through the river waterways in Sumatra took much time, a durable preserved dry rendang is suitable for long journey.” The dried Padang rendang is a durable food, good to consume for weeks, even when left at room temperature.<br/>",1,Where does Redang originate?,,

A red-brick and stone ""mausoleum"" was designed by American architect Calvert Vaux and his collaborator Jacob Wrey Mould.<br/>3. Vaux's ambitious building was not well received; the building's High Victorian Gothic style being already dated prior to completion, and the president of the Met termed the project ""a mistake.""<br/>4.

Since that time, many additions have been made including the distinctive Beaux-Arts Fifth Avenue facade, Great Hall, and Grand Stairway.<br/>6. These were designed by architect and Met trustee Richard Morris Hunt, but completed by his son, Richard Howland Hunt in 1902 after his father's death.<br/>7. The wings that completed the Fifth Avenue facade in the 1910s were designed by the firm of McKim, Mead & White.<br/>8.

The electron (symbol: ) is a subatomic particle with a negative elementary electric charge.<br/>2. Electrons belong to the first generation of the lepton particle family, and are generally thought to be elementary particles because they have no known components or substructure.<br/>3. The electron has a mass that is approximately 1/1836 that of the proton.<br/>4. Quantum mechanical properties of the electron include an intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of a half-integer value in units of ""ħ"", which means that it is a fermion.<br/>5. Being fermions, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state, in accordance with the Pauli exclusion principle.<br/>6. Electrons also have properties of both particles and waves, and so can collide with other particles and can be diffracted like light.<br/>7. Experiments with electrons best demonstrate this duality because electrons have a tiny mass.Many physical phenomena involve electrons in an essential role, such as electricity, magnetism, and thermal conductivity, and they also participate in gravitational, electromagnetic and weak interactions.<br/>8. An electron in space generates an electric field surrounding it.<br/>9. An electron moving relative to an observer generates a magnetic field.<br/>10. External magnetic fields deflect an electron.<br/>11. Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of photons when accelerated.<br/>12. Laboratory instruments are capable of containing and observing individual electrons as well as electron plasma using electromagnetic fields, whereas dedicated telescopes can detect electron plasma in outer space.<br/>13. Electrons have many applications, including electronics, welding, cathode ray tubes, electron microscopes, radiation therapy, lasers, gaseous ionization detectors and particle accelerators.<br/>14. Interactions involving electrons and other subatomic particles are of interest in fields such as chemistry and nuclear physics.<br/>15. The Coulomb force interaction between positive protons inside atomic nuclei and negative electrons composes atoms.<br/>16. Ionization or changes in the proportions of particles changes the binding energy of the system.<br/>17. The exchange or sharing of the electrons between two or more atoms is the main cause of chemical bonding.<br/>18. British natural philosopher Richard Laming first hypothesized the concept of an indivisible quantity of electric charge to explain the chemical properties of atoms in 1838; Irish physicist George Johnstone Stoney named this charge 'electron' in 1891, and J. J. Thomson and his team of British physicists identified it as a particle in 1897.<br/>19. Electrons can also participate in nuclear reactions, such as nucleosynthesis in stars, where they are known as beta particles.<br/>20. Electrons may be created through beta decay of radioactive isotopes and in high-energy collisions, for instance when cosmic rays enter the atmosphere.<br/>21. The antiparticle of the electron is called the positron; it is identical to the electron except that it carries electrical and other charges of the opposite sign.<br/>22. When an electron collides with a positron, both particles may be totally annihilated, producing gamma ray photons. <br/>",17,What's the main cause of chemical bonding?,,

A key element in British success was its ability to mobilize the nation's industrial and financial resources and apply them to defeating France.<br/>2. With a population of 16 million Britain was barely half the size of France with 30 million.<br/>3. In terms of soldiers the French advantage was offset by British subsidies that paid for a large proportion of the Austrian and Russian soldiers, peaking at about 450,000 men in 1813.<br/>4. By the terms of the Anglo-Russian agreement of 1803, Britain paid a subsidy of ₤1.5 million pounds for every 100,000 Russian soldiers in the field.Most important, the British national output remained strong and the well-organized business sector channeled products into what the military needed.<br/>5. Britain used its economic power to expand the Royal Navy, doubling the number of frigates and increasing the number of large ships of the line by 50%, while increasing the roster of sailors from 15,000 to 133,000 in eight years after the war began in 1793.<br/>6. France, meanwhile, saw its navy shrink by more than half.<br/>7. The system of smuggling finished products into the continent undermined French efforts to ruin the British economy by cutting off markets.<br/>8. Subsidies to Russia and Austria kept them in the war.<br/>9. The British budget in 1814 reached £66,000,000, including £10 million for the Royal Navy, £40 million for the army, £10 million for the allies, and £38 million as interest on the national debt.<br/>10. The national debt soared to £679 million, more than double the GDP.<br/>11. It was willingly supported by hundreds of thousands of investors and tax payers, despite the higher taxes on land and a new income tax.<br/>12. The whole cost of the war came to £831 million.<br/>13. By contrast the French financial system was inadequate and Napoleon's forces had to rely in part on requisitions from conquered lands.<br/>",5,What did Britain use its economic power to expand?,,

A rare independent opinion poll published in 2010 indicated that Saudis' main social concerns were unemployment (at 10% in 2010), corruption and religious extremism.<br/>3. Crime is not a significant problem.<br/>4. However, the government of Saudi Arabia's objective of being a religious Islamic country, coupled with economic difficulties, has created deep social tensions in Saudi society.<br/>5. Many Saudis want a reformed, more secular government and to have more influence in the political process.<br/>6. On the other hand, juvenile delinquency, drug-use and excessive use of alcohol are getting worse.<br/>7. High unemployment and a generation of young males filled with contempt toward the Royal Family is a significant threat to Saudi social stability.<br/>8. Some Saudis feel they are entitled to well-paid government jobs, and the failure of the government to satisfy this sense of entitlement has led to considerable dissatisfaction.<br/>9. The Shiite minority, located primarily in the Eastern Province, are subjected to institutionalized government discrimination, inequality and repression.<br/>10. Terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia have made it clear that Saudi Arabia does harbor indigenous terrorists.According to a 2009 U.S. State Department communication by Hillary Clinton, United States Secretary of State, (disclosed as part of the Wikileaks U.S. 'cables leaks' controversy in 2010) ""donors in Saudi Arabia constitute the most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide"".<br/>11. Part of this funding arises through the zakat (an act of charity dictated by Islam) paid by all Saudis to charities, and amounting to at least 2.5% of their income.<br/>12. Although many charities are genuine, others, it is alleged, serve as fronts for money laundering and terrorist financing operations.<br/>13. While many Saudis contribute to those charities in good faith believing their money goes toward good causes, it has been alleged that others know full well the terrorist purposes to which their money will be applied.According to a study conducted by Dr. Nura Al-Suwaiyan, director of the family safety program at the National Guard Hospital, one in four children are abused in Saudi Arabia.<br/>14. The National Society for Human Rights reports that almost 45% of the country's children are facing some sort of abuse and domestic violence.<br/>15. It has also been claimed that trafficking of women is a particular problem in Saudi Arabia as the country's large number of female foreign domestic workers, and loopholes in the system cause many to fall victim to abuse and torture.Widespread inbreeding in Saudi Arabia, resulting from the traditional practice of encouraging marriage between close relatives, has produced high levels of several genetic disorders including thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, spinal muscular atrophy, deafness and muteness.<br/>",11,What is zakat?,,

In 2011, 40% of the UK's electricity was produced by gas, 30% by coal, 19% by nuclear power and 4.2% by wind, hydro, biofuels and wastes.In 2009, the UK produced 1.5 million barrels per day (bbl/d) of oil and consumed 1.7 million bbl/d.<br/>4. Production is now in decline and the UK has been a net importer of oil since 2005. the UK had around 3.1 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves, the largest of any EU member state.<br/>5. In 2009, 66.5% of the UK's oil supply was imported.In 2009, the UK was the 13th largest producer of natural gas in the world and the largest producer in the EU.<br/>6.

In 2009, half of British gas was supplied from imports and this is expected to increase to at least 75% by 2015, as domestic reserves are depleted.Coal production played a key role in the UK economy in the 19th and 20th centuries.<br/>8. In the mid-1970s, 130 million tonnes of coal was being produced annually, not falling below 100 million tonnes until the early 1980s.<br/>9. During the 1980s and 1990s the industry was scaled back considerably.<br/>10. In 2011, the UK produced 18.3 million tonnes of coal.<br/>11. In 2005 it had proven recoverable coal reserves of 171 million tons.<br/>12. The UK Coal Authority has stated there is a potential to produce between 7 billion tonnes and 16 billion tonnes of coal through underground coal gasification (UCG) or 'fraking', and that, based on current UK coal consumption, such reserves could last between 200 and 400 years.<br/>13. However, environmental and social concerns have been raised over chemicals getting into the water table and minor earthquakes damaging homes.In the late 1990s, nuclear power plants contributed around 25% of total annual electricity generation in the UK, but this has gradually declined as old plants have been shut down and ageing-related problems affect plant availability.<br/>14. In 2012, the UK had 16 reactors normally generating about 19% of its electricity.<br/>15. All but one of the reactors will be retired by 2023.<br/>16.

Persons engaged in cycling are referred to as ""cyclists"", ""bikers"", or less commonly, as ""bicyclists"".<br/>3. Apart from two-wheeled bicycles, ""cycling"" also includes the riding of unicycles, tricycles, quadracycles, and similar human-powered vehicles (HPVs).Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and now number about one billion worldwide.<br/>4. They are the principal means of transportation in many parts of the world.Cycling is widely regarded as a very effective and efficient mode of transportation optimal for short to moderate distances.<br/>5. Bicycles provide numerous benefits by comparison with motor vehicles, including the sustained physical exercise necessarily involved in cycling, that cycling involves a reduced consumption of fossil fuels, less air or noise pollution, much reduced traffic congestion, easier parking, greater maneuverability, and access to both roads and paths.<br/>6. The advantages also include reduced financial cost to the user as well as to society at large (negligible damage to roads, less road area required).<br/>7. Among the disadvantages of cycling are the inherent instability of the bicycle, the immensely reduced protection in crashes (especially in collisions with motor vehicles), longer travel time (except in densely populated areas), vulnerability to weather conditions, difficulty in transporting passengers, competition (and interference) with socially beneficial forms of mass public transit, a persistent tendency for cyclists to intrude into pedestrian areas, and the particular levels of skill and fitness required by cycling.<br/>",5,What are the benefits of bicycles compared to motor vehicles?,,

Drake's lyrics on ""Take Care"" address failed romances, missed connections, relationship with friends and family, maintaining balance with growing wealth and fame, concerns about leading a hollow life, the passage of young adulthood, and despondency.<br/>3. The album's slower songs generally explore themes of loneliness, heartbreak, and mistrust.<br/>4.

Andy Gill of ""The Independent"" writes that he ""eschews anger or threat for a weariness shadowed by wistful regret.""<br/>14. Music journalist Greg Kot comments that Drake does not ""indulge in the macho poses that have dominated mainstream hip-hop for decades, and blurthe line between singing and rhyming"", adding that he ""makes his rhymes sound conversational, matter of fact, like he’s talking to the listener one-one-one"".<br/>15. Tim Sendra of Allmusic notes that his ""introspective tone [... is only rarely punctured by aggressive tracks, boasts, and/or come-ons.""<br/>16. Drake's persona on songs shows traits of sincerity, self-doubt, regret, passive-aggressiveness, and self-absorption.<br/>17. Kazeem Famuyide of ""The Source"" explains his conflicted persona as being ""arrogant enough to know his place as one of the most successful artist in hip-hop, and comfortable enough to realize his own faults in his personal life.""<br/>18. Jon Dolan of ""Rolling Stone"" writes that Drake ""collaps many moods – arrogance, sadness, tenderness and self-pity – into one vast, squish-souled emotion.""<br/>19.

The painting is renowned for three characteristics: its colossal size (), the effective use of light and shadow (chiaroscuro), and the perception of motion in what would have traditionally been a static military portrait.The painting was completed in 1642, at the peak of the Dutch Golden Age.<br/>2. It depicts the eponymous company moving out, led by Captain Frans Banning Cocq (dressed in black, with a red sash) and his lieutenant, Willem van Ruytenburch (dressed in yellow, with a white sash).<br/>3. With effective use of sunlight and shade, Rembrandt leads the eye to the three most important characters among the crowd, the two gentlemen in the centre (from whom the painting gets its original title), and the small girl in the centre left background.<br/>4. Behind them, the company's colours are carried by the ensign, Jan Visscher Cornelissen.Rembrandt has displayed the traditional emblem of the Arquebusiers in the painting in a natural way: the girl in yellow dress in the background is carrying the main symbols.<br/>5. She is a kind-of mascot herself: the claws of a dead chicken on her belt represent the ""clauweniers"" (arquebusiers); the pistol behind the chicken stands for 'clover'; and, she is holding the militia's goblet.<br/>6. The man in front of her is wearing a helmet with an oak leaf, a traditional motif of the Arquebusiers.<br/>7. The dead chicken is also meant to represent a defeated adversary.<br/>8. The colour yellow is often associated with victory.Another interpretation proposes that Rembrandt designed this painting with several layers of meaning, as was common among the most talented artists.<br/>9. Thus, the"" Night Watch"" is symmetrically divided, firstly to illustrate the union between the Dutch Protestants and the Dutch Catholics, and secondly to evoke the war effort against the Spaniards.<br/>10. For instance, accordingly to Rembrandt's multilayered design, the taller Captain (in black) symbolizes the Dutch Protestant leadership, loyally supported by the Dutch Catholics (represented by the shorter Lieutenant, in yellow).<br/>11. Moreover, all characters of this painting were conceived to present double readings.<br/>",10,What does the taller Captain symbolize?,,

The history of pathology can be traced back to antiquity when people began examining bodies.<br/>2. The examination of bodies led to the dissection of bodies in order to discover the cause of death.<br/>3. During that time, the people already began formulating today what we know as inflammation, tumors, boils, and much more.Pathology began to develop as a subject during the 19th Century through teachers and physicians that studied pathology.<br/>4. They referred to it as “pathological anatomy” or “morbid anatomy.” However, pathology as a field of medicine was not recognized until the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<br/>5. In the 19th century, physicians realized that disease-causing pathogens, or germs (disease-causing, or pathogenic, microbes, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, amoebae, molds, protists, and prions) existed and were capable of reproduction and multiplication, and that evil spirits or humors, or even the signs and symptoms of the condition, were not the causative agent of a disease.<br/>6. Through the new information gathered regarding germ reproduction, physicians began to compare the characteristics of one germ’s symptoms as they developed within an affected individual to another germ’s characteristics and symptoms.<br/>7. This realization led to the foundational understanding that diseases are able to create themselves, and that they can affect human beings in unique ways.<br/>8. In order to determine causes of diseases, medical experts used the most common and widely accepted assumptions or symptoms of their times.<br/>9. This is true for those in the past and today.What set pathology apart from other specialties was the ability to determine a symptom with the naked eye.<br/>10. During the 19th century, Rudolf Virchow gave the biggest contribution to the field by introducing the procedure of analyzing tissue and cells through a microscope to pathologists.<br/>11. This greatly affected the discipline because it was another way to analyze objects, and it led to more advanced technological developments.By the late 1920s to early 1930s pathology was deemed a medical specialty.<br/>12. During the years following, the decision to split pathology into sub-specialties arose.<br/>13. Today, anatomical, clinical, molecular, forensic, oral, dermatopathology, hematopathology, and neuropathology exist as medical specialties.<br/>14. Today, pathologists are physicians who are diagnosing patients with diseases through examination of biopsies and resections.<br/>15. Their work also includes working with other physicians and scientists on solutions to treat diseases such as various kinds of cancers.<br/>",5,What is another word for disease-causing pathogens?,,

The London Ambulance Service has recently introduced bicycling paramedics, who can often get to the scene of an incident in Central London more quickly than a motorized ambulance.Late in the 20th century, urban police bicycles became more common, as the mobility of car-borne officers was increasingly limited by traffic congestion and pedestrianisation.Bicycles enjoy substantial use as general delivery vehicles in many countries.<br/>4. In the UK and North America, as their first jobs, generations of teenagers have worked at delivering newspapers by bicycle.<br/>5. London has many delivery companies that use bicycles with trailers.<br/>6.

In India, many of Mumbai's Dabbawalas use bicycles to deliver home cooked lunches to the city’s workers.<br/>8.

However, as early as 1907 Rutherford and Thomas Royds had shown that alpha particles, which had a charge of +2, were the nuclei of helium atoms, which had a mass four times that of hydrogen, not two times.<br/>4. If Prout's hypothesis were true, something had to be neutralizing some of the charge of the hydrogen nuclei present in the nuclei of heavier atoms.In 1917 Rutherford succeeded in generating hydrogen nuclei from a nuclear reaction between alpha particles and nitrogen gas, and believed he had proven Prout's law.<br/>5. He called the new heavy nuclear particles protons in 1920 (alternate names being proutons and protyles).<br/>6. It had been immediately apparent from the work of Moseley that the nuclei of heavy atoms have more than twice as much mass as would be expected from their being made of hydrogen nuclei, and thus there was required a hypothesis for the neutralization of the extra protons presumed present in all heavy nuclei.<br/>7. A helium nucleus was presumed to be composed of four protons plus two ""nuclear electrons"" (electrons bound inside the nucleus) to cancel two of the charges.<br/>8. At the other end of the periodic table, a nucleus of gold with a mass 197 times that of hydrogen, was thought to contain 118 nuclear electrons in the nucleus to give it a residual charge of + 79, consistent with its atomic number.<br/>",3,What charge do alpha particle have?,,

Each ethnic group have distinct performing arts, with little overlap between them.<br/>6. However, Malay art does show some North Indian influence due to the historical influence of India.Traditional Malay music and performing arts appear to have originated in the Kelantan-Pattani region with influences from India, China, Thailand and Indonesia.<br/>7. The music is based around percussion instruments, the most important of which is the gendang (drum).<br/>8. There are at least 14 types of traditional drums.<br/>9.

Music is traditionally used for storytelling, celebrating life-cycle events, and occasions such as a harvest.<br/>11. It was once used as a form of long-distance communication.<br/>12. In East Malaysia, gong-based musical ensembles such as agung and kulintang are commonly used in ceremonies such as funerals and weddings.<br/>13. These ensembles are also common in neighbouring regions such as in Mindanao in the Philippines, Kalimantan in Indonesia, and Brunei.Malaysia has a strong oral tradition that has existed since before the arrival of writing, and continues today.<br/>14.

The first Malay literature was in the Arabic script.<br/>16. The earliest known Malay writing is on the Terengganu stone, made in 1303.<br/>17. Chinese and Indian literature became common as the numbers of speakers increased in Malaysia, and locally produced works based in languages from those areas began to be produced in the 19th century.<br/>18. English has also become a common literary language.<br/>19. In 1971, the government took the step of defining the literature of different languages.<br/>20.

Bomber Command and Coastal Command aircraft flew offensive sorties against targets in Germany and France during the battle.<br/>2. After the initial disasters of the war, with Vickers Wellington bombers shot down in large numbers attacking Wilhelmshaven and the slaughter of the Fairey Battle squadrons sent to France, it became clear that Bomber Command would have to operate mainly at night to achieve any results without incurring very high losses.<br/>3. From 15 May 1940, a night time bomber campaign was launched against the German oil industry, communications, and forests/crops, mainly in the Ruhr area.As the threat mounted, Bomber Command changed targeting priority on 3 June 1940 to attack the German aircraft industry.<br/>4. On 4 July, the Air Ministry gave Bomber Command orders to attack ports and shipping.<br/>5. By September, the build-up of invasion barges in the Channel ports had become a top priority target.<br/>6. On 7 September, the government issued a warning that the invasion could be expected within the next few days and, that night, Bomber Command attacked the Channel ports and supply dumps.<br/>7. On 13 September, they carried out another large raid on the Channel ports, sinking 80 large barges in the port of Ostend.<br/>8. 84 barges were sunk in Dunkirk after another raid on 17 September and by 19 September, almost 200 barges had been sunk.<br/>9. The loss of these barges may have contributed to Hitler's decision to postpone Operation ""Sea Lion"" indefinitely.<br/>10. The success of these raids was in part because the Germans had few Freya radar stations set up in France, so that air defences of the French harbours were not nearly as good as the air defences over Germany; Bomber Command had directed some 60% of its strength against the Channel ports.The Bristol Blenheim units also raided German-occupied airfields throughout July to December 1940, both during daylight hours and at night.<br/>11. Although most of these raids were unproductive, there were some successes; on 1 August, five out of 12 Blenheims sent to attack Haamstede and Evere (Brussels) were able to bomb, destroying or heavily damaging three Bf 109s of II./JG 27 and apparently killing a ""Staffelkapitän"" identified as a ""Hauptmann"" Albrecht von Ankum-Frank.<br/>12. Two other 109s were claimed by Blenheim gunners.<br/>13. Another successful raid on Haamstede was made by a single Blenheim on 7 August which destroyed one 109 of 4./JG 54, heavily damaged another and caused lighter damage to four more.There were some missions which produced an almost 100% casualty rate amongst the Blenheims; one such operation was mounted on 13 August 1940 against a ""Luftwaffe"" airfield near Aalborg in north-eastern Denmark by 12 aircraft of 82 Squadron.<br/>14. One Blenheim returned early (the pilot was later charged and due to appear before a court martial, but was killed on another operation), the other 11, which reached Denmark, were shot down, five by flak and six by Bf 109s.<br/>15. Of the 33 crewmen who took part in the attack, 20 were killed and 13 captured.As well as the bombing operations, Blenheim-equipped units had been formed to carry out long-range strategic reconnaissance missions over Germany and German-occupied territories.<br/>16. In this role, the Blenheims again proved to be too slow and vulnerable against ""Luftwaffe"" fighters, and they took constant casualties.Coastal Command directed its attention towards the protection of British shipping, and the destruction of enemy shipping.<br/>17. As invasion became more likely, it participated in the strikes on French harbours and airfields, laying mines, and mounting numerous reconnaissance missions over the enemy-held coast.<br/>18. In all, some 9,180 sorties were flown by bombers from July to October 1940.<br/>19. Although this was much less than the 80,000 sorties flown by fighters, bomber crews suffered about half the total number of casualties borne by their fighter colleagues.<br/>20. The bomber contribution was, therefore, much more dangerous on a loss-per-sortie comparison.Bomber, reconnaissance, and antisubmarine patrol operations continued throughout these months with little respite and none of the publicity accorded to Fighter Command.<br/>21. In his famous 20 August speech about ""The Few"", praising Fighter Command, Churchill also made a point of mentioning Bomber Command's contribution, adding that bombers were even then striking back at Germany; this part of the speech is often overlooked, even today.<br/>22.

He directed that—in negotiations to be held in Paris regarding the aid—countries in the Eastern Bloc should not reject economic conditions being placed upon them.<br/>3. Stalin only changed his outlook when he learned that (a) credit would only be extended under conditions of economic cooperation and,(b) aid would also be extended to Germany in total, an eventuality which Stalin thought would hamper the Soviets' ability to exercise influence in western Germany.Initially, Stalin maneuvered to kill the Plan, or at least hamper it by means of destructive participation in the Paris talks regarding conditions.<br/>4. He quickly realized, however, that this would be impossible after Molotov reported—following his arrival in Paris in July 1947—that conditions for the credit were non-negotiable.<br/>5. Looming as just as large a concern was the Czechoslovak eagerness to accept the aid, as well as indications of a similar Polish attitude.Stalin suspected a possibility that these Eastern Bloc countries might defy Soviet directives not to accept the aid, potentially causing a loss of control of the Eastern Bloc.<br/>6. In addition, the most important condition was that every country choosing to take advantage of the plan would need to have its economic situation independently assessed—a level of scrutiny to which the Soviets could not agree.<br/>7.

Because astrophysics is a very broad subject, ""astrophysicists"" typically apply many disciplines of physics, including mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and molecular physics.In practice, modern astronomical research often involves a substantial amount of work in the realm(s) of theoretical and/or observational physics.<br/>5. Highly elusive areas of study for astrophysicists, which are of immense interest to the public, include their attempts to determine: the properties of dark matter, dark energy, and black holes; whether or not time travel is possible, wormholes can form, or the multiverse exists; and the origin and ultimate fate of the universe.<br/>6. Topics also studied by theoretical astrophysicists include: solar system formation and evolution; stellar dynamics and evolution; galaxy formation and evolution; magnetohydrodynamics; large-scale structure of matter in the universe; origin of cosmic rays; general relativity and physical cosmology, including string cosmology and astroparticle physics.Astrophysics can be studied at the bachelors, masters, and Ph.D. levels in physics or astronomy departments at many universities.<br/>7. Many such programs retain the name ""astronomy"" for historical purposes.<br/>",1,What is the branch of astronomy that deals with the physics of the universe?,,

Hiroshima was the primary target of the first nuclear bombing mission on 6 August, with Kokura and Nagasaki as alternative targets.<br/>2. The 393d Bombardment Squadron B-29 ""Enola Gay"", piloted by Tibbets, took off from North Field, Tinian, about six hours' flight time from Japan.<br/>3. The ""Enola Gay"" (named after Tibbets' mother) was accompanied by two other B-29s.<br/>4. ""The Great Artiste"", commanded by Major Charles Sweeney, carried instrumentation, and a then-nameless aircraft later called ""Necessary Evil"", commanded by Captain George Marquardt, served as the photography aircraft.After leaving Tinian the aircraft made their way separately to Iwo Jima to rendezvous with Sweeney and Marquardt at 05:55 at , and set course for Japan.<br/>5. The aircraft arrived over the target in clear visibility at .<br/>6. Parsons, who was in command of the mission, armed the bomb during the flight to minimize the risks during takeoff.<br/>7. He had witnessed four B-29s crash and burn at takeoff, and feared that a nuclear explosion would occur if a B-29 crashed with an armed Little Boy on board.<br/>8. His assistant, Second Lieutenant Morris R. Jeppson, removed the safety devices 30 minutes before reaching the target area.During the night of August 5–6, Japanese early warning radar detected the approach of numerous American aircraft headed for the southern part of Japan.<br/>9. Radar detected 65 bombers headed for Saga, 102 bound for Maebashi, 261 en route to Nishinomiya, 111 headed for Ube and 66 bound for Imabari.<br/>10. An alert was given and radio broadcasting stopped in many cities, among them Hiroshima.<br/>11. The all-clear was sounded in Hiroshima at 00:05.<br/>12. About an hour before the bombing, the air raid alert was sounded again, as ""Straight Flush"" flew over the city.<br/>13. It broadcast a short message which was picked up by ""Enola Gay"".<br/>14. It read: ""Cloud cover less than 3/10th at all altitudes.<br/>15. Advice: bomb primary.""<br/>16. The all-clear was sounded over Hiroshima again at 07:09.At 08:09 Tibbets started his bomb run and handed control over to his bombardier, Major Thomas Ferebee.<br/>17. The release at 08:15 (Hiroshima time) went as planned, and the Little Boy containing about of uranium-235 took 44.4 seconds to fall from the aircraft flying at about to a detonation height of about above the city.<br/>18.

Lipids.The term lipid composes a diverse range of molecules and to some extent is a catchall for relatively water-insoluble or nonpolar compounds of biological origin, including waxes, fatty acids, fatty-acid derived phospholipids, sphingolipids, glycolipids, and terpenoids (e.g., retinoids and steroids).<br/>2. Some lipids are linear aliphatic molecules, while others have ring structures.<br/>3. Some are aromatic, while others are not.<br/>4. Some are flexible, while others are rigid.Most lipids have some polar character in addition to being largely nonpolar.<br/>5. In general, the bulk of their structure is nonpolar or hydrophobic (""water-fearing""), meaning that it does not interact well with polar solvents like water.<br/>6. Another part of their structure is polar or hydrophilic (""water-loving"") and will tend to associate with polar solvents like water.<br/>7. This makes them amphiphilic molecules (having both hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions).<br/>8. In the case of cholesterol, the polar group is a mere -OH (hydroxyl or alcohol).<br/>9. In the case of phospholipids, the polar groups are considerably larger and more polar, as described below.Lipids are an integral part of our daily diet.<br/>10. Most oils and milk products that we use for cooking and eating like butter, cheese, ghee etc., are composed of fats.<br/>11. Vegetable oils are rich in various polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA).<br/>12. Lipid-containing foods undergo digestion within the body and are broken into fatty acids and glycerol, which are the final degradation products of fats and lipids.<br/>",7,What characterizes an amphiphilic molecule?,,

MRA is often used to evaluate the arteries of the neck and brain, the thoracic and abdominal aorta, the renal arteries, and the legs (called a ""run-off"").<br/>3. A variety of techniques can be used to generate the pictures, such as administration of a paramagnetic contrast agent (gadolinium) or using a technique known as ""flow-related enhancement"" (e.g., 2D and 3D time-of-flight sequences), where most of the signal on an image is due to blood that recently moved into that plane, see also FLASH MRI.<br/>4.

Israel is at the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea, bounded by Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan and the West Bank to the east, and Egypt and the Gaza strip to the southwest.<br/>2. It lies between latitudes 29° and 34° N, and longitudes 34° and 36° E.The sovereign territory of Israel, excluding all territories captured by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War, is approximately in area, of which two percent is water.<br/>3. However Israel is so narrow that the exclusive economic zone in the Mediterranean is double the land area of the country.<br/>4. The total area under Israeli law, including East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, is , and the total area under Israeli control, including the military-controlled and partially Palestinian-governed territory of the West Bank, is .<br/>5. Despite its small size, Israel is home to a variety of geographic features, from the Negev desert in the south to the inland fertile Jezreel Valley, mountain ranges of the Galilee, Carmel and toward the Golan in the north.<br/>6. The Israeli Coastal Plain on the shores of the Mediterranean is home to 57 percent of the nation's population.<br/>7. East of the central highlands lies the Jordan Rift Valley, which forms a small part of the Great Rift Valley.The Jordan River runs along the Jordan Rift Valley, from Mount Hermon through the Hulah Valley and the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea, the lowest point on the surface of the Earth.<br/>8. Further south is the Arabah, ending with the Gulf of Eilat, part of the Red Sea.<br/>9. Unique to Israel and the Sinai Peninsula are makhteshim, or erosion cirques.<br/>10. The largest makhtesh in the world is Ramon Crater in the Negev, which measures .<br/>11. A report on the environmental status of the Mediterranean basin states that Israel has the largest number of plant species per square meter of all the countries in the basin.Temperatures in Israel vary widely, especially during the winter.<br/>12. The more mountainous regions can be windy, cold, and sometimes snowy; Jerusalem usually receives at least one snowfall each year.<br/>13. Meanwhile, coastal cities, such as Tel Aviv and Haifa, have a typical Mediterranean climate with cool, rainy winters and long, hot summers.<br/>14. The area of Beersheba and the Northern Negev has a semi-arid climate with hot summers, cool winters and fewer rainy days than the Mediterranean climate.<br/>15. The Southern Negev and the Arava areas have desert climate with very hot and dry summers, and mild winters with few days of rain.<br/>16. The highest temperature in the continent of Asia () was recorded in 1942 at Tirat Zvi kibbutz in the northern Jordan river valley.From May to September, rain in Israel is rare.<br/>17. With scarce water resources, Israel has developed various water-saving technologies, including drip irrigation.<br/>18. Israelis also take advantage of the considerable sunlight available for solar energy, making Israel the leading nation in solar energy use per capita (practically every house uses solar panels for water heating).Four different phytogeographic regions exist in Israel, due to the country's location between the temperate and the tropical zones, bordering the Mediterranean Sea in the west and the desert in the east.<br/>19. For this reason the flora and fauna of Israel is extremely diverse.<br/>20. There are 2,867 known species of plants found in Israel.<br/>21. Of these, at least 253 species are introduced and non-native.<br/>22. There are 380 Israeli nature reserves.<br/>",18,What nation is the leader in solar energy use per capita?,,

In the wake of the attack, 15 Medals of Honor, 51 Navy Crosses, 53 Silver Stars, four Navy and Marine Corps Medals, one Distinguished Flying Cross, four Distinguished Service Crosses, one Distinguished Service Medal, and three Bronze Star Medals were awarded to the American servicemen who distinguished themselves in combat at Pearl Harbor.<br/>2. Additionally, a special military award, the Pearl Harbor Commemorative Medal, was later authorized for all military veterans of the attack.The day after the attack, Roosevelt delivered his famous Infamy Speech to a Joint Session of Congress, calling for a formal declaration of war on the Empire of Japan.<br/>3. Congress obliged his request less than an hour later.<br/>4. On December 11 Germany and Italy, honoring their commitments under the Tripartite Pact, declared war on the United States.<br/>5. The Tripartite Pact was an earlier agreement between Germany, Italy and Japan which had the principal objective of limiting U.S. intervention in any conflicts involving the three nations.<br/>6. The United States Congress issued a declaration of war against Germany and Italy later that same day.<br/>7. Britain actually declared war on Japan nine hours before the US did, partially due to Japanese attacks on Malaya, Singapore and Hong Kong, and partially due to Winston Churchill's promise to declare war ""within the hour"" of a Japanese attack on the United States.The attack was an initial shock to all the Allies in the Pacific Theater.<br/>8. Further losses compounded the alarming setback.<br/>9. Japan attacked the Philippines hours later (because of the time difference, it was December 8 in the Philippines).<br/>10. Only three days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the ""Prince of Wales"" and ""Repulse"" were sunk off the coast of Malaya, causing British Prime Minister Winston Churchill later to recollect ""In all the war I never received a more direct shock.<br/>11. As I turned and twisted in bed the full horror of the news sank in upon me.<br/>12. There were no British or American capital ships in the Indian Ocean or the Pacific except the American survivors of Pearl Harbor who were hastening back to California.<br/>13. Over this vast expanse of waters Japan was supreme and we everywhere were weak and naked"".Throughout the war, Pearl Harbor was frequently used in American propaganda.One further consequence of the attacks on Pearl Harbor and its aftermath (notably the Niihau Incident) was that Japanese American residents and citizens were relocated to nearby Japanese-American internment camps.<br/>14. Within hours of the attack, hundreds of Japanese American leaders were rounded up and brought to high-security camps such as Sand Island at the mouth of Honolulu harbor and Kilauea Military Camp on the island of Hawaii.<br/>15. Later, over 110,000 Japanese Americans, including United States citizens, were removed from their homes and transferred to internment camps in California, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, Wyoming, Colorado, and Arkansas.The attacks also had international consequences.<br/>16. The Canadian province of British Columbia, being situated on the Pacific coast, had long had a large population of Japanese immigrants.<br/>17. Pre-war tensions were exacerbated by the Pearl Harbor attack, leading to a reaction from the Government of Canada.<br/>18. On February 24, 1942, Order-in-Council P.C.<br/>19. no.<br/>20. 1486 was passed under the War Measures Act allowing for the forced removal of any and all Canadians of Japanese descent from British Columbia, as well as the prohibiting from them returning to the province.<br/>21. The Japanese were given a choice: either be moved into internment camps or be deported back to Japan.<br/>","5,6",On what day did the United States issue a declaration of war against Germany and Italy?,,

The population of Lebanon was estimated to be 4,125,247 in July 2010, however no official census has been conducted since 1932 due to the sensitive confessional political balance between Lebanon's various religious groups.<br/>2. Identifying all Lebanese as ethnically Arab is a widely employed example of panethnicity since in reality, the Lebanese “are descended from many different peoples who have occupied, invaded, or settled this corner of the world,” making Lebanon, “a mosaic of closely interrelated cultures”.<br/>3. While at first glance, this ethnic, linguistic, religious and denominational diversity might seem to cause civil and political unrest, “for much of Lebanon’s history this multitudinous diversity of religious communities has coexisted with little conflict”.The fertility rate fell from 5.00 in 1971 to 1.75 in 2004.<br/>4. Fertility rates vary considerably among the different religious groups: in 2004 it was 2.10 for Shiites, 1.76 Sunnis and 1.61 for Maronites.Lebanon has witnessed a series of migration waves: over 1,500,000 people emigrated from the country in the 1975–2011 period.<br/>5. Millions of people of Lebanese descent are spread throughout the world, mostly Christians, especially in Latin America.<br/>6. Brazil has the largest expatriate population.<br/>7.

Their primary sources of income are UNRWA aid and menial labor sought in competition with about 300,000 Syrian guest workers.<br/>12. The latest estimates by the United Nations put the number of Syrian refugees at more than 850,000.In the last three decades, lengthy and destructive armed conflicts have ravaged the country.<br/>13. The majority of Lebanese have been affected by armed conflict; those with direct personal experience include 75% of the population, and most others report suffering a range of hardships.<br/>14.

The process of sliding a stone down the sheet is known as the ""delivery"".The ""skip"", or the captain of the team, will usually determine the required ""weight"", ""turn"", and ""line"" of the stone.<br/>2. These will be influenced by the tactics at this point in the game, which may involve taking-out, blocking or tapping another stone.<br/>3. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The weight of the stone is its velocity, which depends on the leg drive of the delivery rather than the arm.<br/>4. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The turn, handle, or curl is the rotation of the stone, which gives it a curved trajectory.<br/>5. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The line is the direction of the throw ignoring the effect of the ""turn"".<br/><br/>6. The skip may communicate the ""weight"", ""turn"", ""line,"" and other tactics by calling or tapping a broom on the ice.</br>7. In the case of a takeout, guard, or a tap, the skip will indicate the stones involved.Before delivery, the running surface of the stone is wiped clean and the path across the ice swept with the broom if necessary, because any dirt on the bottom of a stone or in its path can alter the trajectory and ruin the shot.<br/>8. Intrusion by a foreign object is called a ""pick up"" or ""pick"".The thrower throws from the ""hack"".<br/>9. Another player, usually the skip, is stationed behind the ""button"" to determine the tactics, ""weight"", ""turn"", and ""line"", and the other two may sweep in front of the stone to influence the trajectory (see Sweeping, below).<br/>10. The players, with the exception of the skip, take turns throwing and sweeping; when one player (e.g., the lead) throws, the players not throwing (the second and third) sweep.<br/>11. When the skip throws, the ""third"", or vice-skip, takes his role.The thrower's ""gripper"" shoe (with the non-slippery sole) is positioned against one of the hacks; for a right-handed curler the right foot is placed against the left hack and vice-versa for a left-hander.<br/>12. The thrower, now ""in the hack"", lines the body up with shoulders square to the skip's broom at the far end for ""line"".The stone is placed in front of the foot now in the hack.<br/>13. Rising slightly from the hack, the thrower pulls the stone back to the toe (some older curlers may actually raise the stone in this backward movement) then lunges smoothly out from the hack pushing the stone ahead while the slider foot is moved in front of the gripper foot, which trails behind.<br/>14. The thrust from this lunge determines the ""weight"" and hence the distance the stone will travel.<br/>15. While not compulsory, most curlers deliver the stone while sliding out from the hack.<br/>16. Balance may be assisted by a broom held in the free hand with the back of the broom down so that it slides.The stone is released as the thrower's momentum wanes, or the hog line is approached, at which point the ""turn"" is imparted by a slight clockwise or anti-clockwise twist of the handle from around the two or ten o'clock position to the twelve o'clock on release.<br/>17. A typical rate of turn is about 2½ rotations before coming to a rest.The stone must be released before its front edge crosses the near hog line, and it must clear the far hog line or else be removed from play (""hogged""); an exception is made if a stone fails to come to rest beyond the far hog line after rebounding from a stone in play just past the hog line.<br/>18. The release rule is rarely enforced in club play unless abuse is suspected.<br/>19. However, in major tournaments it is strictly enforced; the ""eye on the hog"" sensor in the stone will indicate whether the stone has been legally thrown or not.<br/>20. The lights on the stone handle will either light up green, indicating that the stone has been legally thrown, or red, in which case the illegally thrown stone will be immediately pulled from play instead of waiting for the stone to come to rest.<br/>",17,What is a typical rate of turn for the stone in the game of curling?,,

Both Paul Gauguin (1848–1903) and Paul Cézanne (1839–1906) were accorded major posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the Salon d'Automne in Paris between 1903 and 1907, and both were important influences on Picasso and instrumental to his creation of ""Les Demoiselles.""<br/>2. According to the English art historian, collector and author of ""The Cubist Epoch"", Douglas Cooper, both of those artists were particularly influential to the formation of Cubism and especially important to the paintings of Picasso during 1906 and 1907. Cooper goes on to say however ""Les Demoiselles"" is often erroneously referred to as the first cubist painting.<br/>3. He explains, <br/>4. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ""Demoiselles"" is generally referred to as the first Cubist picture.<br/>5. This is an exaggeration, for although it was a major first step towards Cubism it is not yet Cubist.<br/>6. The disruptive, expressionist element in it is even contrary to the spirit of Cubism, which looked at the world in a detached, realistic spirit.<br/>7. Nevertheless, the ""Demoiselles"" is the logical picture to take as the starting point for Cubism, because it marks the birth of a new pictorial idiom, because in it Picasso violently overturned established conventions and because all that followed grew out of it.<br/><br/>8. Although not well known to the general public prior to 1906, Cézanne's reputation was highly regarded in avant-garde circles, as evidenced by Ambroise Vollard's interest in showing and collecting his work, and by Leo Stein's interest.</br>9. Picasso was familiar with much of Cézanne's work that he saw at Vollard's gallery and at the Stein's.<br/>10. After Cézanne died in 1906, his paintings were exhibited in Paris in a large scale museum-like retrospective in September 1907.<br/>11. The 1907 Cézanne retrospective at the Salon d'Automne greatly impacted the direction that the avant-garde in Paris took, lending credence to his position as one of the most influential artists of the 19th century and to the advent of Cubism.<br/>12. The 1907 Cézanne exhibition was enormously influential in establishing Cézanne as an important painter whose ideas were particularly resonant especially to young artists in Paris.<br/>13. Both Picasso and Braque found the inspiration for their proto-Cubist works in Paul Cézanne, who said to observe and learn to see and treat nature as if it were composed of basic shapes like ""cubes, spheres, cylinders, and cones.""<br/>14. Cézanne's explorations of geometric simplification and optical phenomena inspired Picasso, Braque, Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier, Gris and others to experiment with ever more complex multiple views of the same subject, and, eventually to the fracturing of form.<br/>15. Cézanne thus sparked one of the most revolutionary areas of artistic enquiry of the 20th century, one which was to affect profoundly the development of modern art.Picasso drew each of the figures in ""Les Demoiselles"" differently.<br/>16. The woman pulling the curtain on the far right is rendered with heavy paint.<br/>17. Composed of sharp geometric shapes, her head is the most strictly cubist of all five.<br/>18. The heads of the crouching figure underwent at least two revisions from an Iberian figure to its current state.<br/>19. Much of the critical debate that has taken place over the years centers on attempting to account for this multiplicity of styles within the work.<br/>20. The dominant understanding for over five decades, espoused most notably by Alfred Barr, the first director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and organizer of major career retrospectives for the artist, has been that it can be interpreted as evidence of a transitional period in Picasso's art, an effort to connect his earlier work to Cubism, the style he would help invent and develop over the next five or six years.<br/>",4,What is generally referred to as the first Cubist picture?,,

It is often convenient to study a thermodynamic process in which a single variable, such as temperature, pressure, or volume, etc., is held fixed.<br/>2. Furthermore, it is useful to group these processes into pairs, in which each variable held constant is one member of a conjugate pair.Several commonly studied thermodynamic processes are:<br/>3. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isobaric process: occurs at constant pressure<br/>4. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isochoric process: occurs at constant volume (also called isometric/isovolumetric)<br/>5. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isothermal process: occurs at a constant temperature<br/>6. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adiabatic process: occurs without loss or gain of energy as heat<br/>7. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isentropic process: a reversible adiabatic process occurs at a constant entropy, but is a fictional idealization.<br/>8. Conceptually it is possible to actually physically conduct a process that keeps the entropy of the system constant, allowing systematically controlled removal of heat, by conduction to a cooler body, to compensate for entropy produced within the system by irreversible work done on the system.<br/>9. Such isentropic conduct of a process seems called for when the entropy of the system is considered as an independent variable, as for example when the internal energy is considered as a function of the entropy and volume of the system, the natural variables of the internal energy as studied by Gibbs.<br/>10. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isenthalpic process: occurs at a constant enthalpy<br/>11. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isolated process: no matter or energy (neither as work nor as heat) is transferred into or out of the system<br/><br/>12. It is sometimes of interest to study a process in which several variables are controlled, subject to some specified constraint.</br>13. In a system in which a chemical reaction can occur, for example, in which the pressure and temperature can affect the equilibrium composition, a process might occur in which temperature is held constant but pressure is slowly altered, just so that chemical equilibrium is maintained all the way.<br/>14. There is a corresponding process at constant temperature in which the final pressure is the same but is reached by a rapid jump.<br/>15. Then it can be shown that the volume change resulting from the rapid jump process is smaller than that from the slow equilibrium process.<br/>16. The work transferred differs between the two processes.<br/>",5,What is Isothermal process?,,

Recreational scuba diving does not have a centralized certifying or regulatory agency, and is mostly self regulated.<br/>2. There are, however, several large diving organizations that train and certify divers and dive instructors, and many diving related sales and rental outlets require proof of diver certification from one of these organizations prior to selling or renting certain diving products or services.Underwater diver training is normally given by a qualified instructor who is a member of one of many diving training agencies or is registered with a government agency.Basic diver training entails the learning of skills required for the safe conduct of activities in an underwater environment, and includes procedures and skills for the use of diving equipment, safety, emergency self-help and rescue procedures, dive planning, and use of dive tables.Some of the skills which an entry level diver will normally learn include:<br/>3. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparing and dressing in the diving suit<br/>4. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly and pre-dive testing of the scuba set.<br/>5. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entries and exits<br/>6. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathing from the demand valve<br/>7. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recovering and clearing the demand valve.<br/>8. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearing water from the mask.<br/>9. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buoyancy control using weights and buoyancy compensator<br/>10. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finning techniques, underwater mobility and maneuvering.<br/>11. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making safe and controlled descents and ascents.<br/>12. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equalisation of the ears and other air spaces.<br/>13. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assisting another diver by providing air from one's own supply, or receiving air supplied by another diver.<br/>14. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to return to the surface without injury in the event of a breathing supply interruption.<br/>15. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of bailout systems (professional divers).<br/>16. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diving signals used to communicate underwater.<br/>17. Professional divers will also learn other methods of communication.<br/>18. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dive management skills such as monitoring depth and time and the breathing gas supply<br/>19. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buddy diving procedures.<br/><br/>20. Some knowledge of physiology and the physics of diving is considered necessary by most diver certification agencies, as the diving environment is alien and relatively hostile to humans.</br>21. The physics and physiology knowledge required is fairly basic, and helps the diver to understand the effects of the diving environment so that informed acceptance of the associated risks is possible.The physics mostly relates to gases under pressure, buoyancy, heat loss, and light underwater.<br/>22. The physiology relates the physics to the effects on the human body, to provide a basic understanding of the causes and risks of barotrauma, decompression sickness, gas toxicity, hypothermia, drowning and sensory variations.More advanced training often involves first aid and rescue skills, skills related to specialized diving equipment, and underwater work skills.<br/>",1,Is there a regulatory agency for scuba diving?,,

It spent 10 weeks in the top 3.<br/>3. For Maroon 5, with prior top hits, this is the first time at the number-one position on the Hot 100 chart since their single ""Makes Me Wonder"" in 2007.<br/>4. For Aguilera, this is her fifth number-one position, her first since ""Lady Marmalade"" in 2001.<br/>5. Incidentally, Levine is the first artist to achieve both the number one position on the Hot 100 as a member of a band and reach the top 10 as a solo artist in the same week.<br/>6. ""Moves like Jagger"" made Aguilera the fourth female artist, behind Madonna and Janet Jackson (1980s, 1990s, and 2000s) and Britney Spears (1990s, 2000s, and 2010s), to top the Hot 100 in three decades, as well as the eighth artist overall.<br/>7. On the week of October 1, 2011, the song advanced to number one on the Hot 100 Airplay.<br/>8. By March 2013, it has sold over 6 million digital copies in the United States.<br/>9. As of January 2014, it has sold 6,347,000 copies in the US.On August 1, 2011, ""Moves like Jagger"" reached number two on the Australian ARIA Charts, making it Aguilera's highest charting single since ""Candyman"" in 2007, and held the runner-up spot for ten straight weeks.<br/>10. On the week of August 20, 2011, the song topped the Canadian Hot 100 chart, becoming the band's second number-one single and Aguilera's third number-one single, first in almost nine years (the last one was the 2002 hit ""Beautiful"").<br/>11. ""Moves like Jagger"" made its debut on the UK Singles Chart at number three and sold 56,000 copies on the issue dated August 21, 2011, becoming Maroon 5's 4th top 10 hit and Aguilera's 15th top 10 hit in the UK.<br/>12. Starting at the issue date September 10, it peaked at number two for seven consecutive weeks, equalling the all-time UK record held by All-4-One's ""I Swear"" for the longest stay at number two by a hit not to reach number one.<br/>13. On October 5, 2011, the song reached number one in the mid-week chart update but failed to reach the number one spot the following Sunday due to the mid-week release of Rihanna's new single ""We Found Love"" which debuted at number one keeping ""Moves like Jagger"" away from the number one position.<br/>14. Uniquely, in the first six of these weeks it was held off the top of the chart by six different number one singles consecutively, each of which debuted directly ahead of it; this after having already been held at number three behind two different pairs of new entries in its first two weeks on the chart.As of week ending October 22, ""Moves like Jagger"" dropped two places to number 4, ending a seven-week run in the runner-up position.<br/>15. After spending seven straight weeks at number two in the singles charts without ever managing to claim the number-one spot, it peaked at number two in the year end chart of 2011's best-selling singles as well.<br/>16.

In a letter to Huygens, Rembrandt offered the only surviving explanation of what he sought to achieve through his art: ""the greatest and most natural movement"", translated from ""de meeste en de natuurlijkste beweegelijkheid"".<br/>2. The word ""beweechgelickhijt"" is also argued to mean ""emotion"" or ""motive.""<br/>3. Whether this refers to objectives, material or otherwise is open to interpretation; either way, critics have drawn particular attention to the way Rembrandt seamlessly melded the earthly and spiritual.Earlier 20th century connoisseurs claimed Rembrandt had produced over 600 paintings, nearly 400 etchings and 2,000 drawings.<br/>4. More recent scholarship, from the 1960s to the present day (led by the Rembrandt Research Project), often controversially, has winnowed his oeuvre to nearer 300 paintings.<br/>5. His prints, traditionally all called etchings, although many are produced in whole or part by engraving and sometimes drypoint, have a much more stable total of slightly under 300.<br/>6. It is likely Rembrandt made many more drawings in his lifetime than 2,000, but those extant are more rare than presumed.<br/>7. Two experts claim that the number of drawings whose autograph status can be regarded as effectively ""certain"" is no higher than about 75, although this is disputed.<br/>8. The list was to be unveiled at a scholarly meeting in February 2010.At one time about ninety paintings were counted as Rembrandt self-portraits, but it is now known that he had his students copy his own self-portraits as part of their training.<br/>9. Modern scholarship has reduced the autograph count to over forty paintings, as well as a few drawings and thirty-one etchings, which include many of the most remarkable images of the group.<br/>10. Some show him posing in quasi-historical fancy dress, or pulling faces at himself.<br/>11. His oil paintings trace the progress from an uncertain young man, through the dapper and very successful portrait-painter of the 1630s, to the troubled but massively powerful portraits of his old age.<br/>12. Together they give a remarkably clear picture of the man, his appearance and his psychological make-up, as revealed by his richly weathered face.In his portraits and self-portraits, he angles the sitter's face in such a way that the ridge of the nose nearly always forms the line of demarcation between brightly illuminated and shadowy areas.<br/>13. A Rembrandt face is a face partially eclipsed; and the nose, bright and obvious, thrusting into the riddle of halftones, serves to focus the viewer's attention upon, and to dramatize, the division between a flood of light—an overwhelming clarity—and a brooding duskiness.In a number of biblical works, including ""The Raising of the Cross"", ""Joseph Telling His Dreams"" and ""The Stoning of Saint Stephen"", Rembrandt painted himself as a character in the crowd.<br/>14. Durham suggests that this was because the Bible was for Rembrandt ""a kind of diary, an account of moments in his own life.<br/>15. ""Among the more prominent characteristics of Rembrandt's work are his use of chiaroscuro, the theatrical employment of light and shadow derived from Caravaggio, or, more likely, from the Dutch Caravaggisti, but adapted for very personal means.<br/>16. Also notable are his dramatic and lively presentation of subjects, devoid of the rigid formality that his contemporaries often displayed, and a deeply felt compassion for mankind, irrespective of wealth and age.<br/>17. His immediate family—his wife Saskia, his son Titus and his common-law wife Hendrickje—often figured prominently in his paintings, many of which had mythical, biblical or historical themes.<br/>",1,What did Rembrandt seek to achieve through his art?,,

The FBI was quickly able to identify the hijackers, including leader Mohamed Atta, when his luggage was discovered at Boston's Logan Airport.<br/>5. Atta had been forced to check two of his three bags due to space limitations on the 19-seat commuter flight he took to Boston.<br/>6. Due to a new policy instituted to prevent flight delays, the luggage failed to make it aboard American Airlines Flight 11 as planned.<br/>7.

Cricket is a multi-faceted sport with multiple formats based around playing standard and level of formality and the desired time that the match should last.<br/>2. A pertinent division in terms of professional cricket is between matches limited by time in which the teams have two innings apiece, and those limited by number of overs, in which they have a single innings each.<br/>3. The former, known as first-class cricket, has a duration of three to five days (there have been examples of ""timeless"" matches too); the latter, known as limited overs cricket because each team bowls a limit of typically 50 or 20 overs, has a planned duration of one day only (a match can be extended if necessary due to bad weather, etc.<br/>4. ).Typically, two-innings matches have at least six hours of playing time each day.<br/>5. Limited overs matches often last six hours or more.<br/>6. There are usually formal intervals on each day for lunch and tea with brief informal breaks for drinks.<br/>7. There is also a short interval between innings.Amateur cricketers rarely play matches that last longer than a single day; these may loosely be divided into declaration matches, in which a specified maximum time or number of overs is assigned to the game in total and the teams swap roles only when the batting team is either completely dismissed or declares; and limited overs matches, in which a specified maximum number of overs is assigned for each team's innings individually.<br/>8. These will vary in length between 30 and 60 overs per side at the weekend and the ever popular 20 over format during the evenings.<br/>9. Other forms of cricket, such as indoor cricket and garden cricket remain popular.Historically, a form of cricket known as single wicket had been extremely successful and many of these contests in the 18th and 19th centuries qualify as major cricket matches.<br/>10. In this form, although each team may have from one to six players, there is only one batsman at a time and he must face every delivery bowled while his innings lasts.<br/>11. Single wicket has rarely been played since limited overs cricket began.<br/>",7,"What is a ""declaration match"" in the game of Cricket?",,

The earliest evidences of human presence in Peruvian territory have been dated to approximately 9,000 years BCE.<br/>2. The oldest known complex society in Peru, the Norte Chico civilization, flourished along the coast of the Pacific Ocean between 3,000 and 1,800 BCE.<br/>3. These early developments were followed by archaeological cultures such as Cupisnique, Chavin, Paracas, Mochica, Nazca, Wari, and Chimú.<br/>4. In the 15th century, the Incas emerged as a powerful state which, in the span of a century, formed the largest empire in pre-Columbian America.<br/>5. Andean societies were based on agriculture, using techniques such as irrigation and terracing; camelid husbandry and fishing were also important.<br/>6. Organization relied on reciprocity and redistribution because these societies had no notion of market or money.In December 1532, a party of ""conquistadors"" led by Francisco Pizarro defeated and captured Inca Emperor Atahualpa.<br/>7. Ten years later, the Spanish Crown established the Viceroyalty of Peru, which included most of its South American colonies.<br/>8. Viceroy Francisco de Toledo reorganized the country in the 1570s, with silver mining as its main economic activity and Amerindian forced labor as its primary workforce.Peruvian bullion provided revenue for the Spanish Crown and fueled a complex trade network that extended as far as Europe and the Philippines.<br/>9. However, by the 18th century, declining silver production and economic diversification greatly diminished royal income.<br/>10. In response, the Crown enacted the Bourbon Reforms, a series of edicts that increased taxes and partitioned the Viceroyalty.<br/>11. The new laws provoked Túpac Amaru II's rebellion and other revolts, all of which were quashed.In the early 19th century, while most of South America was swept by wars of independence, Peru remained a royalist stronghold.<br/>12. As the elite vacillated between emancipation and loyalty to the Spanish Monarchy, independence was achieved only after the occupation by military campaigns of José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar.<br/>13. During the early years of the Republic, endemic struggles for power between military leaders caused political instability.Peruvian national identity was forged during this period, as Bolivarian projects for a Latin American Confederation floundered and a union with Bolivia proved ephemeral.<br/>14. Between the 1840s and 1860s, Peru enjoyed a period of stability under the presidency of Ramón Castilla through increased state revenues from guano exports.<br/>15. However, by the 1870s, these resources had been depleted, the country was heavily indebted, and political in-fighting was again on the rise.Peru was defeated by Chile in the 1879–1883 War of the Pacific, ceding the provinces of Arica and Tarapacá in the treaties of Ancón and Lima.<br/>16. Internal struggles after the war were followed by a period of stability under the Civilista Party, which lasted until the onset of the authoritarian regime of Augusto B. Leguía.<br/>17. The Great Depression caused the downfall of Leguía, renewed political turmoil, and the emergence of the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA).<br/>18. The rivalry between this organization and a coalition of the elite and the military defined Peruvian politics for the following three decades.In 1968, the Armed Forces, led by General Juan Velasco Alvarado, staged a coup against president Fernando Belaunde.<br/>19. The new regime undertook radical reforms aimed at fostering development, but failed to gain widespread support.<br/>20. In 1975, General Francisco Morales Bermúdez forcefully replaced Velasco, paralyzed reforms, and oversaw the reestablishment of democracy.<br/>21. During the 1980s, Peru faced a considerable external debt, ever-growing inflation, a surge in drug trafficking, and massive political violence.<br/>22. Under the presidency of Alberto Fujimori (1990–2000), the country started to recover; however, accusations of authoritarianism, corruption, and human rights violations forced his resignation after the controversial 2000 elections.<br/>23. Since the end of the Fujimori regime, Peru has tried to fight corruption while sustaining economic growth.<br/>",10,"What are the ""Bourbon Reforms"" enacted in 18th Century Peru?",,

He further elaborated: ""The pressure I put on myself, or what I hope my 'I Won't Give Up' does, is to make a difference in people's lives .<br/>7. .<br/>8. .<br/>9. With 'I'm Yours,' I got to go out and set my feet on different continents, and expose myself to different cultures and causes.<br/>10. I wanted to see who I was, outside of music.<br/>11. ""Mraz explained the track, in a ""track-by-track"" commentary for ""Billboard"":""'I Won't Give Up' was written selfishly.<br/>12. As many of my songs are, I write for the purpose of understanding what the hell's going on in my life, my position in the world, processing that lesson and that miracle that I'm learning.<br/>13. Seeing it on the page, proving to myself that I understand the lesson, that I'm applying it to my life, and that I can move on.<br/>14. Ultimately it was about, you know, regardless of what happens in this relationship, I don't have to give up on loving this person, or loving myself, or give up on whatever my dreams are.<br/>15. Even though its written through the filter of relationships, it's not necessarily specific for relationships.<br/>16. For me, the true meaning exists in the bridge saying 'I don't want to be someone who walks away so easily, I'm here to stay and make a difference.'<br/>17. That is for all of us.<br/>18. We all have something that we're fighting for or that we're striving for.<br/>19. Whether we want to coach our soccer team to victory or lose five pounds in a month, whatever it is, there's nothing too small worth fighting for and there's nothing too big worth going after.""<br/>",11,What publication featured a track by track commentary of I Won't Give Up?,,

A radio station.<br/>7. WCFL, operated from the north tower of the auditorium.<br/>8. During the 1920s, it is estimated that an average of 3.2 million visitors frequented the Pier annually.<br/>9.

Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands.<br/>2. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area.<br/>3. Neighbouring countries include Indonesia, East Timor and Papua New Guinea to the north; the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and New Caledonia to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east.For at least 40,000 years before the first British settlement in the late 18th century, Australia was inhabited by indigenous Australians,who spoke languages grouped into roughly 250 language groups.<br/>4. After the discovery of the continent by Dutch explorers in 1606, Australia's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain in 1770 and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788.<br/>5. The population grew steadily in subsequent decades; the continent was explored and an additional five self-governing Crown Colonies were established.On 1 January 1901, the six colonies federated, forming the Commonwealth of Australia.<br/>6. Since Federation, Australia has maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy.<br/>7. The federation comprises six states and several territories.<br/>8. The population of 23.1 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated in the eastern states.Australia is a developed country and one of the wealthiest in the world, with the world's 12th-largest economy.<br/>9.

The current Constitution of Chile was approved in a national plebiscite —regarded as ""highly irregular"" by some observers— in September 1980, under the military government of Augusto Pinochet.<br/>2. It entered into force in March 1981.<br/>3. After Pinochet's defeat in the 1988 plebiscite, the constitution was amended to ease provisions for future amendments to the Constitution.<br/>4. In September 2005, President Ricardo Lagos signed into law several constitutional amendments passed by Congress.<br/>5. These include eliminating the positions of appointed senators and senators for life, granting the President authority to remove the commanders-in-chief of the armed forces, and reducing the presidential term from six to four years.The Congress of Chile has a 38-seat Senate and a 120-member Chamber of Deputies.<br/>6. Senators serve for eight years with staggered terms, while deputies are elected every 4 years.<br/>7. The current Senate has a 20–18 split in favor of the opposition coalition.<br/>8. The last congressional elections were held on 13 December 2009, concurrently with the presidential election.<br/>9. The current lower house-the Chamber of Deputies-contains 58 members of the governing center-right coalition, 54 from the center-left opposition and 8 from small parties or independents.<br/>10. The Congress is located in the port city of Valparaíso, about west of the capital, Santiago.Chile's congressional elections are governed by a binomial system that, for the most part, rewards the two largest representations equally, often regardless of their relative popular support.<br/>11. Parties are thus forced to form wide coalitions and, historically, the two largest coalitions (Concertación and Alianza) split most of the seats.<br/>12. Only if the leading coalition ticket out-polls the second place coalition by a margin of more than 2-to-1 does the winning coalition gain both seats, which tends to lock the legislative in a roughly 50-50 split.Chile's judiciary is independent and includes a court of appeal, a system of military courts, a constitutional tribunal, and the Supreme Court of Chile.<br/>13. In June 2005, Chile completed a nationwide overhaul of its criminal justice system.<br/>14. The reform has replaced inquisitorial proceedings with an adversarial system more similar to that of the United States.In the 2001 congressional elections, the conservative Independent Democratic Union (UDI) surpassed the Christian Democrats for the first time to become the largest party in the lower house.<br/>15. In the 2005 parliamentary election, both leading parties, the Christian Democrats and the UDI lost representation in favor of their respective allies Socialist Party (which became the biggest party in the Concertación block) and National Renewal in the right-wing alliance.<br/>16. In the last legislative elections in Chile, the Communist Party won 3 out of 120 seats in the Chamber of Deputies for the first time in 30 years (the Communist Party was not allowed to exist as such during the dictatorship).Chileans voted in the first round of presidential elections on 13 December 2009.<br/>17. None of the four presidential candidates got more than 50 percent of the vote.<br/>18. As a result, the top two candidates, center-left Concertación de Partidos por la Democracia coalition's Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle and center-right Coalición por el Cambio coalition's Sebastián Piñera, competed in a run-off election on 17 January 2010, which Piñera won.<br/>19. This was Chile's fifth presidential election since the end of the Pinochet era.<br/>20. All five have been judged free and fair.<br/>21. The president is constitutionally barred from serving consecutive terms.<br/>",13,What internal national system did Chile overhaul in 2005?,,

This increases the viscosity of the ketchup considerably with a relatively small amount added - usually 0.5%.<br/>3. - which can make it difficult to pour from a container.<br/>4. However, the shear thinning property of the gum ensures that when a force is applied to the ketchup it will lower the viscosity enabling the sauce to flow.<br/>5. A common method to getting ketchup out of the bottle involves inverting the bottle and shaking it or hitting the bottom with the heel of the hand, which causes the ketchup to flow rapidly.<br/>6. A technique involves inverting the bottle and forcefully tapping its upper neck with two fingers (index and middle finger together).<br/>7. Specifically, with a Heinz ketchup bottle, one taps the 57 circle on the neck.<br/>8. This helps the ketchup flow by applying the correct shearing force.<br/>9. These techniques work because of how pseudoplastic fluids behave: their viscosity (resistance to flow) decreases with increasing shear rate.<br/>10.

The Battle of Red Cliffs unfolded in three stages: an initial skirmish at Red Cliffs followed by a retreat to the Wulin (烏林) battlefields on the northwestern bank of the Yangtze, a decisive naval engagement, and Cao Cao's disastrous retreat along Huarong Road.The combined Sun-Liu force sailed upstream from either Xiakou or Fankou to Red Cliffs, where they encountered Cao Cao's vanguard force.<br/>2. Plagued by disease and low morale due to the series of forced marches they had undertaken on the prolonged southern campaign , Cao Cao's men could not gain an advantage in the small skirmish which ensued, so Cao Cao retreated to Wulin (north of the Yangtze River) and the allies pulled back to the south .Cao Cao had chained his ships from stem to stern, possibly aiming to reduce seasickness in his navy, which comprised mostly northerners who were not used to living on ships.<br/>3. Observing this, divisional commander Huang Gai sent Cao Cao a letter feigning surrender and prepared a squadron of capital ships described as ""mengchong doujian"" (蒙衝鬥艦).<br/>4. The ships had been converted into fire ships by filling them with bundles of kindling, dry reeds, and fatty oil.<br/>5. As Huang Gai's ""defecting"" squadron approached the midpoint of the river, the sailors applied fire to the ships before taking to small boats.<br/>6. The unmanned fire ships, carried by the southeastern wind, sped towards Cao Cao's fleet and set it ablaze.<br/>7. Within a short time smoke and flames stretched across the sky, and a large number of men and horses either burned to death or drowned .Following the initial shock, Zhou Yu and the allies led a lightly armed force to capitalise on the assault.<br/>8. The northern army was thrown into confusion and was utterly defeated.<br/>9. Seeing the situation was hopeless, Cao Cao then issued a general order of retreat and destroyed a number of his remaining ships before withdrawing .Cao Cao's army attempted a retreat along Huarong Road, including a long stretch passing through marshlands north of Dongting Lake.<br/>10. Heavy rains had reduced the track to a thick mire, making the road so treacherous that many of the sick soldiers had to carry bundles of grass on their backs and use them to fill the road, to allow the horsemen to cross.<br/>11. Many of these soldiers drowned in the mud or were trampled to death in the effort.<br/>12. To the misery of Cao Cao's army, the allies, led by Zhou Yu and Liu Bei, gave chase over land and water until they reached Nan Commandery (南郡; present-day Jiangling County, Jingzhou, Hubei); combined with famine and disease, this decimated Cao Cao's remaining forces.<br/>13.

However, the crossing of the Yangtze River dissolved into chaos as the allied armies converged on the riverbank and fought over the limited number of ferries.<br/>15. To restore order, a detachment led by Sun Quan's general Gan Ning established a bridgehead in Yiling to the north, and only a staunch rearguard action by Cao Ren prevented further catastrophe (; ).<br/>",1,"In the Battle of Red Cliffs had three stages, what were those stages?",,

Most concussions occur during player to player contact (49%) rather than when a player is checked into the boards (35%).<br/>4. Not only are lacerations common, “it is estimated that direct trauma accounts for 80% of all injuries.<br/>5. Most of these injuries are caused by player contact, falls and contact with a puck, high stick and occasionally, a skate blade.” (Schmidt 3) One of the causes of head injury is checking from behind.<br/>6. Due to the danger of delivering a check from behind, many leagues, including the NHL have made this a major and gross misconduct penalty (called ""boarding"").<br/>7. Another type of check that accounts for many of the player to player contact concussions is a check to the head.<br/>8. A check to the head can be defined as delivering a hit while the receiving player’s head is down and their waist is bent and the aggressor is targeting the receiving player's head.<br/>9. Checks to the head have accounted for nearly 50% of concussions that players in the National Hockey League have suffered.<br/>10. Concussions that players suffer may go unreported because there are no obvious physical signs if a player is not knocked unconscious.<br/>11. This can prove to be dangerous if a player decides to return to play without receiving proper medical attention.<br/>12.

The proton is a subatomic particle with the symbol or and a positive electric charge of 1 elementary charge.<br/>2. One or more protons are present in the nucleus of each atom.<br/>3. Protons and neutrons are collectively referred to as ""nucleons"".<br/>4. The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is referred to as its atomic number.<br/>5. Since each element has a unique number of protons, each element has its own unique atomic number.<br/>6. The name ""proton"" was given to the hydrogen nucleus by Ernest Rutherford in 1920, because in previous years he had discovered that the hydrogen nucleus (known to be the lightest nucleus) could be extracted from the nuclei of nitrogen by collision, and was thus a candidate to be a fundamental particle and building block of nitrogen, and all other heavier atomic nuclei.In the modern Standard Model of particle physics, the proton is a hadron, and like the neutron, the other nucleon (particle present in atomic nuclei), is composed of three quarks.<br/>7. Prior to that model becoming a consensus in the physics community, the proton was considered a fundamental particle.<br/>8. In the modern view, a proton is composed of three valence quarks: two up quarks and one down quark.<br/>9. The rest masses of the quarks are thought to contribute only about 1% of the proton's mass.<br/>10. The remainder of the proton mass is due to the kinetic energy of the quarks and to the energy of the gluon fields that bind the quarks together.Because the proton is not a fundamental particle, it possesses a physical size—although this is not perfectly well-defined since the ""surface"" of a proton is somewhat fuzzy, due to being defined by the influence of forces that do not come to an abrupt end.<br/>11. The proton is about 1.6–1.7 fm in diameter.The free proton (a proton not bound to nucleons or electrons) is a stable particle that has not been observed to break down spontaneously to other particles.<br/>12. Free protons are found naturally in a number of situations in which energies or temperatures are high enough to separate them from electrons, for which they have some affinity.<br/>13. Free protons exist in plasmas in which temperatures are too high to allow them to combine with electrons.<br/>14. Free protons of high energy and velocity make up 90% of cosmic rays, which propagate in vacuum for interstellar distances.<br/>15. Free protons are emitted directly from atomic nuclei in some rare types of radioactive decay.<br/>16. Protons also result (along with electrons and antineutrinos) from the radioactive decay of free neutrons, which are unstable.At sufficiently low temperatures, free protons will bind to electrons.<br/>17. However, the character of such bound protons does not change, and they remain protons.<br/>18. A fast proton moving through matter will slow by interactions with electrons and nuclei, until it is captured by the electron cloud of an atom.<br/>19. The result is a protonated atom, which is a chemical compound of hydrogen.<br/>20. In vacuum, when free electrons are present, a sufficiently slow proton may pick up a single free electron, becoming a neutral hydrogen atom, which is chemically a free radical.<br/>21. Such ""free hydrogen atoms"" tend to react chemically with many other types of atoms at sufficiently low energies.<br/>22. When free hydrogen atoms react with each other, they form neutral hydrogen molecules (H2), which are the most common molecular component of molecular clouds in interstellar space.<br/>23. Such molecules of hydrogen on Earth may then serve (among many other uses) as a convenient source of protons for accelerators (as used in proton therapy) and other hadron particle physics experiments that require protons to accelerate, with the most powerful and noted example being the Large Hadron Collider.<br/>",4,The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is referred to as what?,,

Galen was the founder of experimental physiology.Jean Fernel, a French physician, introduced the term ""physiology"" in 1525.In the 19th century, physiological knowledge began to accumulate at a rapid rate, in particular with the 1838 appearance of the Cell theory of Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann.<br/>4. It radically stated that organisms are made up of units called cells.<br/>5. Claude Bernard's (1813–1878) further discoveries ultimately led to his concept of ""milieu interieur"" (internal environment), which would later be taken up and championed as ""homeostasis"" by American physiologist Walter Cannon.In the 20th century, biologists also became interested in how organisms other than human beings function, eventually spawning the fields of comparative physiology and ecophysiology.<br/>6. Major figures in these fields include Knut Schmidt-Nielsen and George Bartholomew.<br/>7. Most recently, evolutionary physiology has become a distinct subdiscipline.<br/>",5,"Where did Walter Cannon derive his concept of ""homeostasis""?",,

Al Shipley of ""The Village Voice"" agreed with this comparison, attributing the song's success to the changing music industry as a result of advertising and iTunes.<br/>6.

Suzy Bishop, also 12, lives on the island with her parents, Walt and Lauraboth attorneysand her three younger brothers in a house called Summer's End.<br/>3. Sam and Suzy, both introverted, intelligent, and mature for their age, met in the summer of 1964 during a church performance of ""Noye's Fludde"" and have been pen pals since then.<br/>4. Having fallen in love over the course of their correspondence, they have made a secret pact to reunite and run away together.<br/>5. Sam brings camping equipment, and Suzy brings her binoculars, six books, her cat, and her brother's battery-powered record player.<br/>6. They hike, camp, and fish together in the wilderness with the goal of reaching a secluded cove on the island.<br/>7. They are confronted by a group of Khaki Scouts who try to capture them, and during the resulting altercation Suzy injures one of the Scouts with scissors and Camp Ivanhoe's dog is killed by a stray shot from a bow and arrow wielded by one of the Scouts.<br/>8. The Scouts flee, and Sam and Suzy hike to the cove, which they name Moonrise Kingdom.<br/>9. They set up camp, and go swimming.<br/>10. Later, while drying off, they begin dancing to Françoise Hardy in their underwear.<br/>11.

Ben works at Fort Lebanon, a larger Khaki Scout summer camp located on St. Jack Wood Island and run by Commander Pierce, who is Ward's boss and views Ward as incompetent.<br/>16. Ben decides that the best available option is to try to get Sam and Suzy aboard a crabbing boat anchored off the island so that Sam can work as a crewman and avoid Social Services, but before leaving he performs a ""wedding"" ceremony, which he admits is not legally binding.<br/>17. Sam and Suzy never make it onto the crabbing boat, and instead are pursued by Suzy's parents, Captain Sharp, Social Services, and the Scouts of Fort Lebanon under the command of Scoutmaster Ward, who displays great leadership after Commander Pierce is incapacitated.A violent hurricane and flash flood strike only three days after Sam and Suzy first ran away from home and, after many twists and turns, Sharp apprehends Sam and Suzy on the steeple of the church in which they first met.<br/>18.

The Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815) were a series of wars between Napoleon's French Empire and opposing coalitions led by Great Britain.<br/>2. As a continuation of the wars sparked by the French Revolution of 1789, they revolutionized European armies and played out on an unprecedented scale, mainly owing to the application of modern mass conscription.<br/>3. French power rose quickly as Napoleon's armies conquered much of Europe but collapsed rapidly after France's disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812.<br/>4. Napoleon was defeated in 1814; he returned and was finally defeated in 1815 at Waterloo, and all France's gains were taken away by the victors.Before a final victory against Napoleon, five of seven coalitions saw defeat at the hands of France.<br/>5. France defeated the first and second coalitions during the French Revolutionary Wars, the third (notably at Austerlitz), the fourth (notably at Jena, Eylau, and Friedland) and the fifth coalition (notably at Wagram) under the leadership of Napoleon.<br/>6. These great victories gave the French Army a sense of invulnerability, especially when it approached Moscow.<br/>7. But after the retreat from Russia, in spite of incomplete victories, France was defeated by the sixth coalition at Leipzig, in the Peninsular War at Vitoria and at the hands of the seventh coalition at Waterloo.The wars resulted in the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire and sowed the seeds of nascent nationalism in Germany and Italy that would lead to the two nations' respective consolidations later in the century.<br/>8. Meanwhile, the global Spanish Empire began to unravel as French occupation of Spain weakened Spain's hold over its colonies, providing an opening for nationalist revolutions in Spanish America.<br/>9. As a direct result of the Napoleonic wars, the British Empire became the foremost world power for the next century, thus beginning ""Pax Britannica"".No consensus exists about when the French Revolutionary Wars ended and the Napoleonic Wars began.<br/>10. An early candidate is 9 November 1799, the date of Bonaparte's coup seizing power in France.<br/>11. However, the most common date is 18 May 1803, when renewed war broke out between Britain and France, ending the one-year-old Peace of Amiens, the only period of general peace in Europe between 1792 and 1814.<br/>12. Most actual fighting ceased following Napoleon's final defeat at Waterloo on 18 June 1815, although skirmishing continued as late as 3 July 1815 at the Battle of Issy.<br/>13. The Second Treaty of Paris officially ended the wars on 20 November 1815.<br/>",9,"As a result of the Napoleonic Wars, the British Empire rose in power, beginning the historical period known as what?",,

Production.Conception.Shonda Rhimes, the series' creator, wanted to make a show that she would enjoy watching, and thought it would be interesting to create a show about ""smart women competing against one another"".<br/>2. When asked how she decided to develop a medical drama, Rhimes responded: The series was pitched to the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), who gave the green light, and the show was picked up as a mid-season replacement for ""Boston Legal"" in the 2005 television season.<br/>3. Francie Calfo, executive vice president of development at ABC Entertainment, commented that ABC was looking for a medical show that was unlike the others airing at the time.<br/>4. She pointed out that “shows are hard, and it was hard trying to figure out where ours could be different.<br/>5. But where everybody else is speeding up their medical shows, [Rhimes found a way to slow it down, so you get to know the characters.<br/>6. There's definitely a strong female appeal to it.<br/>7. ""Rhimes initially conceived ""Grey's Anatomy"" as a statement against racism.<br/>8. She endeavored to create a show that featured a racially diverse cast that allowed viewers to relate to characters regardless of race.<br/>9. While creating characters, as well as writing the first script, the series' writers had no character descriptions in mind, and hoped to cast the best actor available for each part.<br/>10. Rhimes has explained that if the network did not allow her to create characters this way, she would have been hesitant about moving forward with the series.<br/>11. Female roles in particular were developed as multi-faceted characters.<br/>12. Rhimes offered her insight on this: ""I wanted to create a world in which you felt as if you were watching very real women.<br/>13. Most of the women I saw on TV didn't seem like people I actually knew.<br/>14. They felt like ideas of what women are.<br/>15. They never got to be nasty or competitive or hungry or angry.<br/>16. They were often just the loving wife or the nice friend.<br/>17. But who gets to be the bitch?<br/>18. Who gets to be the three-dimensional woman?<br/>19. ""The series debuted on March 25, 2005 and was scheduled to run in the ""Boston Legal"" time slot for four weeks.<br/>20. However, high ratings and viewership led to it holding onto the slot for the remainder of the season.<br/>21. ABC Entertainment President, Steve McPherson, commented on the scheduling change: ""Ultimately we decided that, without having adequate lead time or marketing dollars to devote to moving either show so late in the season, we'd continue to let [""Grey's Anatomy""] build on its tremendous momentum through May.""<br/>22. The show's title, ""Grey's Anatomy"", was devised as a play on words: a reference to both Henry Gray's medical textbook, ""Gray's Anatomy"", and the title character Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo).<br/>23.

The injuries observed range from very minor injuries to fatalities.A recent study in Germany reported that the relative risk of injury from riding a horse, compared to riding a bicycle, was 9 times higher for adolescents and 5.6 times higher for younger children, but that riding a horse was less risky than riding a moped.<br/>3. In Victoria, Australia, a search of state records found that equestrian sports had the third highest incidence of serious injury, after motor sports and power boating.<br/>4. In Greece, an analysis of a national registry estimated the incidence of equestrian injury to be 21 per 100,000 person-years for farming and equestrian sports combined, and 160 times higher for horse racing personnel.<br/>5. Other findings were that use of spurs may contribute to ankle fractures and dislocations, and helmets likely prevent traumatic brain injuries.In the United States each year an estimated 30 million people ride horses, resulting in 50,000 emergency room visits (1 visit per 600 riders per year).<br/>6. A survey of 679 equestrians in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho estimated that at some time in their equestrian career one in five will be seriously injured, resulting in hospitalization, surgery, or long-term disability.<br/>7.

Approximately 100 hours of experience are required to achieve a substantial decline in the risk of injury.<br/>9. The survey authors conclude that efforts to prevent equestrian injury should focus on novice equestrians.<br/>",8,How many hours of equestrian experience has shown a significant decline in risk of injury?,,

Battle.Initial air attacks.At about 09:00 on 3 June, Ensign Jack Reid, piloting a PBY from US Navy patrol squadron VP-44, spotted the Japanese Occupation Force some to the west-southwest of Midway.<br/>2. He mistakenly reported this group as the Main Force.<br/>3. Nine B-17s took off from Midway at 12:30 for the first air attack.<br/>4. Three hours later, they found the Japanese Tanaka's transport group to the west.Under heavy anti-aircraft fire, they dropped their bombs.<br/>5. Though hits were reported, none of the bombs actually hit and no significant damage was inflicted.<br/>6. Early the following morning Japanese oil tanker ""Akebono Maru"" sustained the first hit when a torpedo from an attacking PBY struck her around 01:00.<br/>7. This was the only successful air-launched torpedo attack by the U.S. during the entire battle.At 04:30 on 4 June, Nagumo launched his initial attack on Midway itself, consisting of 36 Aichi D3A dive bombers and 36 Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers, escorted by 36 Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters.<br/>8. At the same time he launched a defensive combat air patrol (CAP) with his eight search aircraft (one from the heavy cruiser launched 30 minutes late due to technical difficulties).Japanese reconnaissance arrangements were flimsy, with too few aircraft to adequately cover the assigned search areas, laboring under poor weather conditions to the northeast and east of the task force.<br/>9. Yamamoto's faulty dispositions had now become a serious liability.As Nagumo's bombers and fighters were taking off, 11 PBYs were leaving Midway to run their search patterns.<br/>10. At 05:30, PBY reported sighting two Japanese carriers with empty decks, indicating an air strike en route.<br/>11. American radar picked up the enemy at a distance of several miles, and interceptors were scrambled.<br/>12. Unescorted bombers headed off to attack the Japanese carrier fleet, their fighter escorts remaining behind to defend Midway.At 06:20 Japanese carrier aircraft bombed and heavily damaged the U.S. base.<br/>13. Midway-based Marine fighters, which included 7 F4Fs and 21 F2As, intercepted the Japanese and suffered heavy losses, though they managed to destroy four B5Ns and at least three A6Ms.<br/>14. Within the first few minutes, 3 F4Fs and 13 F2As were destroyed, while most of the surviving U.S. planes were damaged, with only two remained airworthy.<br/>15. American anti-aircraft fire was accurate and intense, destroying four additional Japanese aircraft and damaging many more.Of the 108 Japanese aircraft involved in this attack, 11 were destroyed, 14 were heavily damaged, and 29 were damaged to some degree.<br/>16. The initial Japanese attack did not succeed in neutralizing Midway: American bombers could still use the airbase to refuel and attack the Japanese invasion force, and most of Midway's land-based defenses were intact.<br/>17. Japanese pilots reported to Nagumo that another aerial attack to soften Midway's defences would be necessary if troops were to go ashore by 7 June.Having taken off prior to the Japanese attack, American bombers based on Midway made several attacks on the Japanese carrier fleet.<br/>18. These included six Grumman Avengers, detached to Midway from the s VT-8 (Midway was the first combat mission for the VT-8 airmen, and it was the combat debut of the TBF), Marine Scout-Bombing Squadron 241 (VMSB-241), consisting of eleven SB2U-3s and sixteen SBDs, plus four USAAF B-26s, armed with torpedoes, and fifteen B-17s.<br/>19. The Japanese repelled these attacks for the loss of two fighters, destroying five TBFs, two SB2Us, eight SBDs and two B-26s.<br/>20. The first Marine aviator to perish in the battle, Major Lofton R. Henderson of VMSB-241, was killed while leading his inexperienced Dauntless squadron into action.<br/>21. The main airfield at Guadalcanal was named Henderson Field after him in August 1942; two civil airports also bear this name.One B-26, after being seriously damaged by anti-aircraft fire, veered into a steep dive straight toward the ""Akagi"".<br/>22. Making no attempt to pull out of its run, the aircraft narrowly missed crashing directly into the carrier's bridge, which could potentially have killed Nagumo and his command staff.<br/>23. This experience may well have contributed to Nagumo's determination to launch another attack on Midway, in direct violation of Yamamoto's order to keep the reserve strike force armed for anti-ship operations.<br/>",3,How many B-17s took off from Midway for the first air attack?,,

Research over the past few decades has shown that the nutrients and minerals in seafood can make improvements in brain development and reproduction and has highlighted the role for seafood in the functions of the human body.Doctors have known of strong links between fish and healthy hearts ever since they noticed that fish-eating Inuit populations in the Arctic had low levels of heart disease.<br/>2. One study has suggested that adding one portion of fish a week to your diet can cut your chances of suffering a heart attack by half.<br/>3. Fish is thought to protect the heart because eating less saturated fat and more Omega-3 can help to lower the amount of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood – two fats that, in excess, increase the risk of heart disease.<br/>4. Omega-3 fats also have natural built-in anti-oxidants, which are thought to stop the thickening and damaging of artery walls.<br/>5. Regularly eating fish oils is also thought to reduce the risk of arrhythmia – irregular electrical activity in the heart which increases the risk of sudden heart attacks.10-12% of the human brain is composed of lipids, including the Omega-3 fat DHA.<br/>6. Recent studies suggest that older people can boost their brain power by eating more oily fish, what with regular consumers being able to remember better and think faster than those who don't consume at all.<br/>7. Other research has also suggested that adding more DHA to the diet of children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder can reduce their behavioural problems and improve their reading skills, while there have also been links suggested between DHA and better concentration.<br/>8. Separate studies have suggested that older people who eat fish at least once a week could also have a lower chance of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease.Including fish as a regular part of a balanced diet has been shown to help the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis – a painful condition that causes joints to swell up, reducing strength and mobility.<br/>9. Studies also show that sufferers feel less stiff and sore in the morning if they keep their fish oil intake topped up.<br/>10. Recent research has also found a link between Omega-3 fats and a slowing down in the wearing of cartilage that leads to osteoarthritis, opening the door for more research into whether eating more fish could help prevent the disease.Fish is high in minerals such as zinc, iodine and selenium, which keep the body running smoothly.<br/>11. Iodine is essential for the thyroid gland, which controls growth and metabolism, while selenium is used to make enzymes that protect cell walls from cancer-causing free radicals, and helps prevent DNA damage caused by radiation and some chemicals.<br/>12. Fish is also a source of vitamin A, which is needed for healthy skin and eyes, and vitamin D, which is needed to help the body absorb calcium to strengthen teeth and bones.<br/>",11,Iodine is essential for what gland that controls growth and metabolism?,,

The song was released in Australia and New Zealand by on 5 July 2011 as the second single from Gotye's third studio album, ""Making Mirrors"" (2011).<br/>3. It was later released by Universal Music in December 2011 in the United Kingdom, and in January 2012 in the United States and Ireland.<br/>4. ""Somebody That I Used To Know"" was written and recorded by Gotye at his parents' house on the Mornington Peninsula in Victoria and is lyrically related to the experiences he has had with relationships.<br/>5. ""Somebody That I Used to Know"" is a mid-tempo, indie pop ballad.<br/>6. It samples Luiz Bonfá's song ""Seville"" from his 1967 album ""Luiz Bonfa Plays Great Songs"".<br/>7. The song received positive reception from critics, who noted the similarities between the song and works by Sting, Peter Gabriel and American folk band Bon Iver.<br/>8. The song won the Triple J Hottest 100 poll at the end of 2011, as well as ARIA Awards for song of the year and best video, while Kimbra was voted best female artist and Gotye was named best male artist and producer of the year.<br/>9. In 2013 the song won two Grammy Awards for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and Record of the Year, and came ninth in the Triple J Hottest 100 of the Past 20 Years, 2013.Commercially, ""Somebody That I Used to Know"" became Gotye's most successful and signature song.<br/>10. It topped the US, UK, Australian as well as 23 other national charts, and reached the top 10 in more than 30 countries around the world.<br/>11. The song has sold more than 13 million copies worldwide, becoming one of the best-selling digital singles of all time.<br/>12. It was also placed at the top of a number of year-end charts by ""Billboard Magazine"" (including the Hot 100, Adult Pop Songs, and Alternative Songs) and other record chart companies around the world.<br/>13. ""Somebody That I Used To Know"" has been performed several times live on shows such as ""The Voice"", ""American Idol"" and ""Saturday Night Live"".<br/>14. It was covered by Canadian indie rock group Walk off the Earth using a single guitar played simultaneously by all five band members.<br/>15. The original single's accompanying music video was directed by Natasha Pincus.<br/>16.

The minor hall, originally for stage productions only, incorporated opera and ballet functions and was called the Opera Theatre, later renamed the Joan Sutherland Theatre.<br/>3. As a result, the Joan Sutherland Theatre is inadequate to stage large-scale opera and ballet.<br/>4. A theatre, a cinema and a library were also added.<br/>5. These were later changed to two live drama theatres and a smaller theatre ""in the round"".<br/>6. These now comprise the Drama Theatre, the Playhouse, and the Studio, respectively.<br/>7. These changes were primarily because of inadequacies in the original competition brief, which did not make it adequately clear how the Opera House was to be used.<br/>8. The layout of the interiors was changed, and the stage machinery, already designed and fitted inside the major hall, was pulled out and largely thrown away, as detailed in the 1968 BBC TV documentary ""Autopsy on a Dream"", which ""chronicles the full spectrum of controversy surrounding the construction of the Sydney Opera House"".<br/>9. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Externally, the cladding to the podium and the paving (the podium was originally not to be clad down to the water, but to be left open).<br/>10. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The construction of the glass walls (Utzon was planning to use a system of prefabricated plywood mullions, but a different system was designed to deal with the glass).<br/>11. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Utzon's plywood corridor designs, and his acoustic and seating designs for the interior of both major halls, were scrapped completely.<br/>12.

Chemical reactions such as combustion in the fire, fermentation and the reduction of ores to metals were known since antiquity.<br/>2. Initial theories of transformation of materials were developed by Greek philosophers, such as the Four-Element Theory of Empedocles stating that any substance is composed of the four basic elements – fire, water, air and earth.<br/>3. In the Middle Ages, chemical transformations were studied by Alchemists.<br/>4. They attempted, in particular, to convert lead into gold, for which purpose they used reactions of lead and lead-copper alloys with sulfur.The production of chemical substances that do not normally occur in nature has long been tried, such as the synthesis of sulfuric and nitric acids attributed to the controversial alchemist Jābir ibn Hayyān.<br/>5. The process involved heating of sulfate and nitrate minerals such as copper sulfate, alum and saltpeter.<br/>6. In the 17th century, Johann Rudolph Glauber produced hydrochloric acid and sodium sulfate by reacting sulfuric acid and sodium chloride.<br/>7. With the development of the lead chamber process in 1746 and the Leblanc process, allowing large-scale production of sulfuric acid and sodium carbonate, respectively, chemical reactions became implemented into the industry.<br/>8. Further optimization of sulfuric acid technology resulted in the contact process in 1880s, and the Haber process was developed in 1909–1910 for ammonia synthesis.From the 16th century, researchers including Jan Baptist van Helmont, Robert Boyle and Isaac Newton tried to establish theories of the experimentally observed chemical transformations.<br/>9. The phlogiston theory was proposed in 1667 by Johann Joachim Becher.<br/>10. It postulated the existence of a fire-like element called ""phlogiston"", which was contained within combustible bodies and released during combustion.<br/>11. This proved to be false in 1785 by Antoine Lavoisier who found the correct explanation of the combustion as reaction with oxygen from the air.Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac recognized in 1808 that gases always react in a certain relationship with each other.<br/>12. Based on this idea and the atomic theory of John Dalton, Joseph Proust had developed the law of definite proportions, which later resulted in the concepts of stoichiometry and chemical equations.Regarding the organic chemistry, it was long believed that compounds obtained from living organisms were too complex to be obtained synthetically.<br/>13. According to the concept of vitalism, organic matter was endowed with a ""vital force"" and distinguished from inorganic materials.<br/>14. This separation was ended however by the synthesis of urea from inorganic precursors by Friedrich Wöhler in 1828.<br/>15. Other chemists who brought major contributions to organic chemistry include Alexander William Williamson with his synthesis of ethers and Christopher Kelk Ingold, who, among many discoveries, established the mechanisms of substitution reactions.<br/>","3, 4",Which group first actively experimented with chemicals by applying theory and not just experimental observations?,,

Architect Daniel H. Burnham, assisted by Pierce Anderson, was inspired by a number of different architectural styles.<br/>2. Classical elements included the Arch of Constantine (exterior, main façade) and the great vaulted spaces of the Baths of Diocletian (interior); prominent siting at the intersection of two of Pierre L'Enfant's avenues, with an orientation that faced the United States Capitol just five blocks away; a massive scale, including a façade stretching more than 600 feet and a waiting room ceiling 96 feet above the floor; stone inscriptions and allegorical sculpture in the Beaux-Arts style; expensive materials such as marble, gold leaf, and white granite from a previously unused quarry.In the Attic block, above the main cornice of the central block, stand six colossal statues (modeled on the Dacian prisoners of the Arch of Constantine) created by Louis St. Gaudens.<br/>3. These are entitled ""The Progress of Railroading"" and their iconography expresses the confident enthusiasm of the American Renaissance movement: Prometheus (for Fire), Thales (for Electricity), Themis (for Freedom and Justice), Apollo (for Imagination and Inspiration), Ceres (for Agriculture) and Archimedes (for Mechanics).<br/>4. The substitution of Agriculture for Commerce in a railroad station iconography vividly conveys the power of a specifically American lobbying bloc.<br/>5. St. Gaudens also created the 26 centurions for the station's main hall.Burnham drew upon a tradition, launched with the 1837 Euston railway station in London, of treating the entrance to a major terminal as a triumphal arch.<br/>6. He linked the monumental end pavilions with long arcades enclosing loggias in a long series of bays that were vaulted with the lightweight fireproof Guastavino tiles favored by American Beaux-Arts architects.<br/>7. The final aspect owed much to the Court of Heroes at the World’s Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago, where Burnham had been coordinating architect.<br/>8. The setting of Union Station’s façade at the focus of converging avenues in a park-like green setting is one of the few executed achievements of the City Beautiful movement: elite city planning that was based on the ""goosefoot"" (""patte d'oie"") of formal garden plans made by Baroque designers such as André Le Nôtre.The station held a full range of dining rooms and other services, including barber shops and a mortuary.<br/>9.

Mozhaisk defense line (13 – 30 October).By 13 October 1941, the ""Wehrmacht"" had reached the Mozhaisk defense line, a hastily constructed double set of fortifications protecting Moscow's western approaches that extended from Kalinin towards Volokolamsk and Kaluga.<br/>2. Despite recent reinforcements, only around 90,000 Soviet soldiers manned this line - far too few to stem the German advance.<br/>3. Given the limited resources available, Zhukov decided to concentrate his forces at four critical points: the 16th Army under Lieutenant General Rokossovsky guarded Volokolamsk, Mozhaisk was defended by 5th Army under Major General Govorov, the 43rd Army of Major General Golubev defended Maloyaroslavets, and the 49th Army under Lieutenant General Zakharkin protected Kaluga.<br/>4. The entire Soviet Western Front—almost completely destroyed after its encirclement near Vyazma—was being recreated almost from scratch.Moscow itself was also hastily fortified.<br/>5. According to Zhukov, 250,000 women and teenagers worked building trenches and anti-tank moats around Moscow, moving almost three million cubic meters of earth with no mechanical help.<br/>6. Moscow's factories were hastily converted to military tasks: one automobile factory was turned into a submachine gun armory, a clock factory manufactured mine detonators, the chocolate factory shifted to food production for the front, and automobile repair stations worked fixing damaged tanks and military vehicles.<br/>7. Despite these preparations, the capital was seemingly within striking distance of German ""panzers"" and was targeted in massive air raids, although these raids caused only limited damage because of extensive anti-aircraft defenses and effective civilian fire brigades.On 13 October 1941 (15 October 1941, according to other sources), the ""Wehrmacht"" resumed its offensive.<br/>8. At first, the Germans attempted to bypass Russian defenses by pushing northeast towards the weakly protected city of Kalinin, and south towards Kaluga and Tula, capturing all except Tula by 14 October.<br/>9. Encouraged by these initial successes, the Germans launched a frontal assault against the fortified line, taking Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets on 18 October, Naro-Fominsk on 21 October, and Volokolamsk on 27 October after intense fighting.<br/>10. Because of the increasing danger of flanking attacks, Zhukov was forced to fall back, withdrawing his forces east of the Nara River.In the south, the Second Panzer Army initially advanced towards Tula with relative ease because the Mozhaisk defense line did not extend that far south and no significant concentrations of Soviet troops blocked their advance.<br/>11. However bad weather, fuel problems, and damaged roads and bridges eventually slowed the Germans, and Guderian did not reach the outskirts of Tula until 26 October 1941.<br/>12. The German plan initially called for a rapid capture of Tula followed by a pincer move around Moscow.<br/>13. The first attack, however, was repelled by the 50th Army and civilian volunteers on October 29 after a desperate fight that occurred within sight of the city.<br/>14. On 31 October, the ""OKH"" ordered a halt to all offensive operations until increasingly severe logistical problems were resolved and the ""rasputitsa"" subsided.<br/>",5,What is the best example of civilian fortifications extending the effectiveness of the Russian military?,,

As in indoor volleyball, there are several basic skills competitive players need to master: serving, passing, setting, attacking, blocking, and digging.Serving is the act of putting the ball into play by striking it with the hand or arm from behind the rear court boundary.<br/>2. The skill is similar on the beach and indoors, with the exception that on the beach the wind often has a significant effect on the trajectory of the ball.The pass is the first of a team's 3 allowed contacts, and is also very similar on the beach and indoors.<br/>3. However, the standards for hand setting (handling the ball overhand using finger action with the hands separated) are stricter on the beach.<br/>4. In practice, this means that players are effectively forbidden from setting the ball on serve receive; similarly, players seldom use a hand setting motion as the first (except on a hard driven attack) or last of the three allowed team contacts.<br/>5. Digging is a similar skill to passing, but the term is not used to describe receiving the serve or a free ball, but rather refers to an attempt to prevent an opponent's attack hit from touching the court.The set is the second team contact, and its purpose is to position the ball for an attack on the third hit.<br/>6. A hand setting motion is often used, but bump setting, an underhand motion in which the ball bounces off the forearms, is also common.<br/>7. When using the hand motion contact for the setting the ball has to come out ""clean"".<br/>8. This means that the ball cannot spin at all in the air once it leaves the setters hands.<br/>9. If a referee determines that it was not a ""clean"" contact then they will call a double contact and the point will be given to the other team.<br/>10. After completing the contact, the setter typically turns his attention to the defense and communicates to his partner whether a blocker is up and which area of the court is open.<br/>11. The second contact can also be used to attack the ball.Attacking includes skills such as spiking—hitting the ball hard with one open hand on a downward trajectory from above the top of the net; rolling—a similar motion to spiking, but softer and with an arcing trajectory; and dinking—directing the ball very softly low over the net.<br/>12. Attack hits are also frequently made with a poking motion with the knuckles or stiff straight fingers.Blocking is an attempt to direct an attack hit by the opponents back into their court by reaching above the top of the net.<br/>13. Players often decide against blocking (if the pass and set are not in a good position to produce a spike attack) and instead opt to Peel off the net and dig.<br/>14. This peeling action is a skill almost exclusive to beach volleyball.<br/>","13, 14",What alternative to digging does a beach volleyball player have?,,

The scientist William Gilbert proposed, in his ""De Magnete"" (1600), that electricity and magnetism, while both capable of causing attraction and repulsion of objects, were distinct effects.<br/>2. Mariners had noticed that lightning strikes had the ability to disturb a compass needle, but the link between lightning and electricity was not confirmed until Benjamin Franklin's proposed experiments in 1752.<br/>3. One of the first to discover and publish a link between man-made electric current and magnetism was Romagnosi, who in 1802 noticed that connecting a wire across a voltaic pile deflected a nearby compass needle.<br/>4. However, the effect did not become widely known until 1820, when Ørsted performed a similar experiment.<br/>5. Ørsted's work influenced Ampère to produce a theory of electromagnetism that set the subject on a mathematical foundation.A theory of electromagnetism, known as classical electromagnetism, was developed by various physicists over the course of the 19th century, culminating in the work of James Clerk Maxwell, who unified the preceding developments into a single theory and discovered the electromagnetic nature of light.<br/>6. In classical electromagnetism, the electromagnetic field obeys a set of equations known as Maxwell's equations, and the electromagnetic force is given by the Lorentz force law.One of the peculiarities of classical electromagnetism is that it is difficult to reconcile with classical mechanics, but it is compatible with special relativity.<br/>7. According to Maxwell's equations, the speed of light in a vacuum is a universal constant, dependent only on the electrical permittivity and magnetic permeability of free space.<br/>8. This violates Galilean invariance, a long-standing cornerstone of classical mechanics.<br/>9. One way to reconcile the two theories (electromagnetism and classical mechanics) is to assume the existence of a luminiferous aether through which the light propagates.<br/>10. However, subsequent experimental efforts failed to detect the presence of the aether.<br/>11. After important contributions of Hendrik Lorentz and Henri Poincaré, in 1905, Albert Einstein solved the problem with the introduction of special relativity, which replaces classical kinematics with a new theory of kinematics that is compatible with classical electromagnetism.<br/>12. (For more information, see History of special relativity.<br/>13. )In addition, relativity theory shows that in moving frames of reference a magnetic field transforms to a field with a nonzero electric component and vice versa; thus firmly showing that they are two sides of the same coin, and thus the term ""electromagnetism"".<br/>14.

Field Marshals von Rundstedt and Rommel repeatedly asked Hitler for more discretion but were refused.<br/>8. Von Rundstedt was removed from his command on 29 June after he bluntly told the Chief of Staff at Hitler's Armed Forces HQ (Field Marshal Keitel) to ""Make peace, you idiots!""<br/>9. Rommel was severely injured by Allied aircraft on 17 July.The German commanders also suffered in the quality of the available troops.<br/>10. Sixty thousand of the 850,000 in Rundstedt's command were raised from the many prisoners of war captured on the Eastern Front.<br/>11. These ""Ost"" units had volunteered to fight against Stalin, but when instead unwisely used to defend France against the Western Allies, ended up being unreliable.<br/>12. Many surrendered or deserted at the first available opportunity.<br/>",2,Which factor contributing to the German losses at Normandy were strictly beyond the Germans' control?,,

Michelangelo was the artistic heir to the great 15th-century sculptors and painters of Florence.<br/>2. He learnt his trade first under the direction of a masterly fresco painter, Domenico Ghirlandaio, known for two great fresco cycles in the Sassetti Chapel and Tornabuoni Chapel, and for his contribution to the cycle of paintings on the walls of the Sistine Chapel.<br/>3. As a student Michelangelo studied and drew from the works of the two most renowned Florentine fresco painters of the early Renaissance, Giotto and Masaccio.<br/>4. Masaccio's figures of Adam and Eve being expelled from the Garden of Eden had a profound effect on the depiction of the nude in general, and in particular on the use of the nude figure to convey human emotion.<br/>5. Helen Gardner says that in the hands of Michelangelo ""the body is simply the manifestation of the soul, or of a state of mind and character"".<br/>6. Michelangelo was also almost certainly influenced by the paintings of Luca Signorelli whose paintings, particularly the ""Death and Resurrection Cycle"" in Orvieto Cathedral contain a great number of nudes and inventive figurative compositions.<br/>7. In Bologna, Michelangelo saw the relief sculptures of Jacopo della Quercia around the doors of the cathedral.<br/>8. In Michelangelo's depiction of the ""Creation of Eve"" the whole composition, the form of the figures and the relatively conservative concept of the relationship between Eve and her Creator adheres closely to Jacopo's design.<br/>9. Other panels on the ceiling, most particularly the iconic ""Creation of Adam"" show ""...unprecedented invention"".The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel was to have a profound effect upon other artists, even before it was completed.<br/>10. Vasari, in his Life of Raphael, tells us that Bramante, who had the keys to the chapel, let Raphael in to examine the paintings in Michelangelo's absence.<br/>11. On seeing Michelangelo's prophets, Raphael went back to the picture of the Prophet Isaiah that he was painting on a column in the Church of Sant'Agostino and, according to Vasari, although it was finished, he scraped it off the wall and repainted it in a much more powerful manner, in imitation of Michelangelo.<br/>12. John O'Malley points out that even earlier than the Isaiah is Raphael's inclusion of the figure of Heraclitus in the ""School of Athens"", a brooding figure similar to Michelangelo's Jeremiah, but with the countenace of Michelangelo himself, and leaning on a block of marble.There was hardly a design element on the ceiling that was not subsequently imitated: the fictive architecture, the muscular anatomy, the foreshortening, the dynamic motion, the luminous colouration, the haunting expressions of the figures in the lunettes, the abundance of putti.<br/>13. Gabriele Bartz and Eberhard König have said of the ""Ignudi"", ""There is no image that has had a more lasting effect on following generations than this.<br/>14. Henceforth similar figures disported themselves in innumerable decorative works, be they painted, formed in stucco or even sculpted.<br/>15. ""Within Michelangelo's own work, the chapel ceiling led to the later and more Mannerist painting of the Last Judgement in which the crowded compositions gave full rein to his inventiveness in painting contorted and foreshortened figures expressing despair or jubilation.<br/>16. Among the artists in whose work can be seen the direct influence of Michelangelo are Pontormo, Andrea del Sarto, Correggio, Tintoretto, Annibale Carracci, Paolo Veronese and El Greco.In January 2007, it was claimed that as many as 10,000 visitors passed through the Vatican Museums in a day and that the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel is the biggest attraction.<br/>17. The Vatican, anxious at the possibility that the newly restored frescoes will suffer damage, announced plans to reduce visiting hours and raise the price in an attempt to discourage visitors.Five hundred years earlier Vasari had said ""The whole world came running when the vault was revealed, and the sight of it was enough to reduce them to stunned silence.""<br/>",16,How many people went through the Vatican in one day in January 2007?,,

Olympic weightlifting, also called Olympic-style weightlifting, or weightlifting, is an athletic discipline in the modern Olympic programme in which the athlete attempts a maximum-weight single lift of a barbell loaded with weight plates.The two competition lifts in order are the snatch and the clean and jerk.<br/>2. Each weightlifter receives three attempts in each, and the combined total of the highest two successful lifts determines the overall result within a bodyweight category.<br/>3. Bodyweight categories are different for women and men.<br/>4. A lifter who fails to complete at least one successful snatch and one successful clean and jerk also fails to ""total"", and therefore receives an ""incomplete"" entry for the competition.<br/>5. The clean and press was once a competition lift, but was discontinued due to difficulties in judging proper form.In comparison with other strength sports, which test limit strength (with or without lifting aids), Olympic weightlifting tests aspects of human ballistic limits (explosive strength) and are therefore executed faster—and with more mobility and a greater range of motion during their execution - than other lifts.<br/>6. Properly executed, the snatch and the clean and jerk are both dynamic and explosive while appearing graceful, especially when viewed from a recording at a slowed speed.While there are relatively few competitive Olympic weightlifters (or more simply ""lifters""), the lifts and their components are commonly used by elite athletes in other sports to train for both explosive and functional strength.<br/>",3,Are bodyweight categories similar or different for the genders?,,

Development and production.Conception.In 2002, Fey was the head writer and a performer on the television show ""Saturday Night Live"" (""SNL"").<br/>2. She pitched the show that became ""30 Rock"" to NBC, originally as a sitcom about cable news.<br/>3. NBC Entertainment president Kevin Reilly felt that ""Fey was using the news setting as a fig leaf for her own experience and encouraged her to write what she knew.""<br/>4. The show was subsequently reworked to revolve around an ""SNL""-style sketch show.<br/>5. After being presented to Reilly once more, the show was set to air during the 2005–2006 television season.<br/>6. Just before the deal went through, however, the show was nearly brushed aside by Anthony Lewis and Jack Melcher, two NBC executives who fought the idea, fearing that Fey's removal from ""SNL"" would result in a severe cut to the show's ratings.<br/>7. Eventually, Lewis gave in just a month before his retirement, and Melcher backed down.<br/>8. In May 2003, Fey signed a contract with NBC to remain in her ""SNL"" head writer position until at least the 2004–2005 television season and to develop a prime-time project to be produced by Broadway Video and NBC Universal.<br/>9. Filming was postponed due to Tina Fey's first pregnancy.During the 2004–2005 pilot season, a pilot was announced named ""Untitled Tina Fey Project"".<br/>10. The ""30 Rock"" pilot focused on the boss of a variety show who has to manage her relationships with the show's volatile star and its charismatic executive producer.<br/>11. The storyline evolved into one that dealt with a head writer of a variety show who dealt with both the stars as well as the show's new network executive.<br/>12. ""30 Rock"" was officially given the green light to air May 15, 2006, along with a 13-episode order.The series underwent further changes during the months leading up to and following its debut.<br/>13. A May 2006 press release mentioned that sketches from ""The Girlie Show"" would be made available in their entirety on NBC's broadband website, DotComedy.com.<br/>14.

Serbia and Montenegro would attack in the theater of Sandjak, Bulgarian and Serbia in Macedonia and Thrace.The Ottoman Empire's situation was difficult.<br/>3. Its population of about 26 million people provided a massive pool of manpower, but 3/4 of the population and nearly all of the Muslim component lived in the Asian part of the Empire.<br/>4. Reinforcements had to come from Asia mainly by sea, which depended on the result of battles between the Turkish and Greek navies in the Aegean.With the outbreak of the war, the Ottoman Empire activated three Army HQs: the Thracian HQ in Constantinople, the Western HQ in Salonika, and the Vardar HQ in Skopje, against the Bulgarians, the Greeks and the Serbians respectively.<br/>5. Most of their available forces were allocated to these fronts.<br/>6. Smaller independent units were allocated elsewhere, mostly around heavily fortified cities.Montenegro was the first that declared war on 8 October (25 September O.S.).<br/>7. Its main thrust was towards Shkodra, with secondary operations in the Novi Pazar area.<br/>8. The rest of the Allies, after giving a common ultimatum, declared war a week later.<br/>9. Bulgaria attacked towards Eastern Thrace, being stopped only at the outskirts of Constantinople at the Çatalca line and the isthmus of the Gallipoli peninsula, while secondary forces captured Western Thrace and Eastern Macedonia.<br/>10. Serbia attacked south towards Skopje and Monastir and then turned west to present-day Albania, reaching the Adriatic, while a second Army captured Kosovo and linked with the Montenegrin forces.<br/>11. Greece's main forces attacked from Thessaly into Macedonia through the Sarantaporo strait and after capturing Thessaloniki on 12 November (on 26 October 1912, O.S.)<br/>12. expanded its occupied area and linked up with the Serbian army to the northwest, while its main forces turned east towards Kavala, reaching the Bulgarians.<br/>13. Another Greek army attacked into Epirus towards Ioannina.In the naval front the Ottoman fleet twice exited the Dardanelles and was twice defeated by the Greek Navy, in the battles of Elli and Lemnos.<br/>14. Greek dominance on the Aegean Sea made it impossible for the Ottomans to transfer the planned troops from the Middle East to the Thracian (against the Bulgarian) and to the Macedonian (against the Greeks and Serbians) fronts.<br/>15. According to the E.J.<br/>16. Erickson the Greek Navy also played a crucial, albeit indirect role, in the Thracian campaign by neutralizing no less than three Thracian Corps (see First Balkan War, the Bulgarian theater of operations), a significant portion of the Ottoman Army there, in the all-important opening round of the war.<br/>17. After the defeating of the Ottoman fleet the Greek Navy was also free to liberate the islands of the Aegean.<br/>18. General Nikola Ivanov identified the activity of the Greek Navy as the chief factor in the general success of the allies.In January, after a successful coup by young army officers, the Ottoman Empire decided to continue the war.<br/>19. After a failed Ottoman counter-attack in the Western-Thracian front, Bulgarian forces with the help of the Serbian Army managed to conquer Adrianople while Greek forces managed to take Ioannina after defeating the Ottomans in the battle of Bizani.<br/>20. In the joint Serbian-Montenegrin theater of operation the Montenegrin army besieged and captured the Shkodra, ending the Ottoman presence in Europe west of the Çatalca line after nearly 500 years.<br/>21.

Epigenetics is the study of mitotically and/or meiotically heritable changes in gene function that cannot be explained by changes in the underlying DNA sequence but cause the organism's genes to behave (or ""express themselves"") differently.<br/>2. One example of epigenetic change is the marking of the genes by DNA methylation which determines whether they will be expressed or not.<br/>3. Gene expression can also be controlled by repressor proteins that attach to silencer regions of the DNA and prevent that region of the DNA code from being expressed.<br/>4. Epigenetic marks may be added or removed from the DNA during programmed stages of development of the plant, and are responsible, for example, for the differences between anthers, petals and normal leaves, despite the fact that they all have the same underlying genetic code.<br/>5. Epigenetic changes may be temporary or may remain through successive cell divisions for the remainder of the cell's life.<br/>6. Some epigenetic changes have been shown to be heritable, while others are reset in the germ cells.Epigenetic changes in eukaryotic biology serve to regulate the process of cellular differentiation.<br/>7. During morphogenesis, totipotent stem cells become the various pluripotent cell lines of the embryo, which in turn become fully differentiated cells.<br/>8. A single fertilized egg cell, the zygote, gives rise to the many different plant cell types including parenchyma, xylem vessel elements, phloem sieve tubes, guard cells of the epidermis, etc.<br/>9. as it continues to divide.<br/>10. The process results from the epigenetic activation of some genes and inhibition of others.Unlike animals, many plant cells, particularly those of the parenchyma, do not terminally differentiate, remaining totipotent with the ability to give rise to a new individual plant.<br/>11. Exceptions include highly lignified cells, the sclerenchyma and xylem which are dead at maturity, and the phloem sieve tubes which lack nuclei.<br/>12. While plants use many of the same epigenetic mechanisms as animals, such as chromatin remodeling, an alternative hypothesis is that plants set their gene expression patterns using positional information from the environment and surrounding cells to determine their developmental fate.<br/>",8,What is the single fertilized egg cell called?,,

Twenty-three percent of Singaporean citizens were born outside Singapore (i.e.<br/>3. foreign born citizens).<br/>4. There are half a million permanent residents in Singapore in 2012.<br/>5. The resident population does not take into account the 11 million transient visitors who visit Singapore annually.The median age of Singaporeans is 37 years old and the average household size is 3.5 persons.<br/>6. Due to scarcity of land, four out of five Singaporeans live in subsidised, high-rise, public housing apartments known as Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats, after the board responsible for public housing in the country.<br/>7. Live-in domestic helpers are quite common in Singapore and there are nearly 200,000 domestic helpers there.In 2010, three quarters of Singaporean residents live in properties that are equal to or larger than a four-room HDB flat or in private housing.<br/>8.

At age 54, he was the youngest member of the Politburo.<br/>3. Gorbachev's primary goal as General Secretary was to revive the Soviet economy after the stagnant Brezhnev years.In an effort to revive the stagnant Soviet economy, in 1985 new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev began a process of increasing political liberalization (glasnost/perestroika) in the communist one-party state.In 1985, he announced that the Soviet economy was stalled and that reorganization was needed.<br/>4. Gorbachev soon realized that fixing the Soviet economy would be nearly impossible without reforming the political and social structure of the Communist nation.<br/>5. The reforms began in personnel changes.<br/>6. On 23 April 1985 Gorbachev brought his two proteges Yegor Ligachev, and Nikolai Ryzhkov into the Politburo as full members, and sensibly took the opportunity to keep the 'power' ministries happy by promoting KGB Head Viktor Chebrikov from candidate to full member of the Politburo, and appointing Minister of Defence Marshal Sergei Sokolov a Politburo candidate member.<br/>7. Nikonov was brought into the CPSU Central Committee Secretariat.<br/>8. However, this liberalization led to the emergence from 1986 onwards of nationalist movements and ethnic disputes within the diverse republics of the Soviet Union.<br/>9. It also led to the revolutions of 1989, which saw the mainly peaceful (Romania excepted) toppling of the Soviet imposed Communist regimes of the Warsaw Pact, which in turn increased pressure on Gorbachev to introduce greater democracy and autonomy for the Soviet Union's constituent republics.<br/>10. Under Gorbachev's leadership, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1989 introduced limited competitive elections to a new central legislature, the Congress of People's Deputies, although a ban on other political parties was not lifted until 1990.<br/>11. A 17 March 1991 referendum showed 76.4% of Soviet citizens voting to retain the Union.<br/>12. However, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldavia, Georgia, and Armenia did not participate.In May 1985 in Leningrad Gorbachev made a speech advocating widespread reforms.<br/>13. One of the first reforms Gorbachev introduced was the anti-alcohol campaign, begun in May 1985, which was designed to fight widespread alcoholism in the Soviet Union.<br/>14. Prices of vodka, wine, and beer were raised, and their sales were restricted.<br/>15. It was a serious blow to the state budget, a loss of approximately 100 billion rubles according to Alexander Yakovlev, after alcohol production migrated to the black market economy.<br/>16. The purpose of these reforms, however, was to prop up the existing centrally planned economy, unlike later reforms, which tended toward market socialism.On 1 July 1985 Gorbachev promoted Eduard Shevardnadze First Secretary of the Georgian Communist Party to full member of the Politburo, and the following day appointed Shevardnadze as Minister of Foreign Affairs replacing Andrei Gromyko.<br/>17. Gromyko, disparaged as ""Mr Nyet"" in the West, had served for 28 years as Minister of Foreign Affairs and was considered an 'old thinker' who was kicked upstairs to the mainly ceremonial position of Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, which was officially Soviet Head of State.<br/>18. Also on July 1, 1985 Gorbachev took the opportunity to dispose of his main rival by removing Grigory Romanov from the Politburo, and brought Boris Yeltsin and Lev Zaikov into the CPSU Central Committee Secretariat.In the fall Gorbachev continued his program to bring forward younger and more energetic men into the government.<br/>19. On September 27, 1985 Nikolai Ryzhkov replaced 79 year old Nikolai Tikhonov as Chairman of the Council of Ministers, effectively the Soviet Prime Minister, and on 14 October 1985 Nikolai Talyzin replaced Nikolai Baibakov as Chairman of the State Planning Committee (GOSPLAN).<br/>20. At the next Central Committee meeting on 15 October 1985 Tikhonov retired from the Politburo and Nikolai Talyzin became a candidate member.Finally on 23 December 1985 Gorbachev appointed Boris Yeltsin First Secretary of the Moscow Communist Party replacing Viktor Grishin.<br/>",1,When was Michail Gorbachev elected General secretary?,,

Murphy commented: ""Anybody and everybody now has a chance to be on a show about talented underdogs.<br/>4. We want to be the first interactive musical comedy on television.""<br/>5. On June 22, 2010, Josef Adalian of ""New York"" magazine revealed that the reality show would not go ahead, due to Murphy's desire to concentrate on the main series, and fear that the distraction of the reality show may damage ""Glee"".<br/>6. Adalian reported that the production team would still choose several winners from the entrants and invite them to appear on ""Glee"" for at least one episode.<br/>7.

It was selected as recommended viewing by ""The Guardian"", with the comment: ""it's a fascinating look at the real-life New Directions, and it's equally as crackers as its TV champion.""<br/>13.

The series featured live shows in which established and new musical performance groups competed against each other, performing well-known songs in new arrangements, with viewers voting on the winner.<br/>17.

In the aftermath of the sinking, public inquiries were set up in Britain and the United States.<br/>2. The US inquiry began on 19 April under the chairmanship of Senator William Alden Smith, while the British inquiry commenced in London under Lord Mersey on 2 May 1912.<br/>3. They reached broadly similar conclusions: the regulations on the number of lifeboats that ships had to carry were out of date and inadequate; Captain Smith had failed to take proper heed of ice warnings; the lifeboats had not been properly filled or crewed; and the collision was the direct result of steaming into a danger area at too high a speed.<br/>4. Captain Lord of the ""Californian"" was strongly criticised by both inquiries for failing to render assistance to ""Titanic"".However neither inquiry found negligence by IMM or the White Star Line as a factor.<br/>5. The US inquiry concluded that those involved had merely followed standard practice, and the disaster could thus only be categorised as an ""act of God"", and the British inquiry concluded that Smith had followed long-standing practice which had not previously been shown to be unsafe (the inquiry noted that British ships alone had carried 3.5 million passengers over the previous decade with the loss of just 10 lives) and concluded that he had done ""only that which other skilled men would have done in the same position.""<br/>6. The British inquiry also warned that ""What was a mistake in the case of the ""Titanic"" would without doubt be negligence in any similar case in the future.<br/>7. ""The disaster led to major changes in maritime regulations to implement new safety measures, such as ensuring that more lifeboats were provided, that lifeboat drills were properly carried out and that radio equipment on passenger ships was manned around the clock.<br/>8. An International Ice Patrol was set up to monitor the presence of icebergs in the North Atlantic, and maritime safety regulations were harmonised internationally through the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS); both measures are still in force today.<br/>",8,What does SOLAS stand for?,,

J. Cook), and Penelope Garcia (Kirsten Vangsness).<br/>2. During season one, Vangsness was not a part of the main cast, but instead appeared as a recurring star.<br/>3. Since season two, she has been promoted to the main cast.<br/>4. In season two (2006-07), Lola Glaudini announced her departure from the show, as she was unhappy living in Los Angeles and wished to return to Brooklyn.<br/>5. She is replaced by Emily Prentiss (Paget Brewster), the daughter of an ambassador (Kate Jackson).<br/>6. Although fans were initially wary of Lola Glaudini's departure, Paget Brewster's role in the show has received large praise from fans.<br/>7. In season three, Patinkin announced his departure from the show, because he was deeply disturbed with the content depicted in the show.<br/>8. He left apologetic letters for his fellow cast members explaining his reasons and wishing them luck.<br/>9. He is replaced by David Rossi (Joe Mantegna), a former FBI agent and best-selling author.<br/>10. Although fans were devastated with Mandy Patinkin's decision to leave, Joe Mantegna's role in the show has been well received, and fans eventually accepted him and his character.<br/>11. In season four (2008-09), A. J. Cook became pregnant with her first child, fathered by her husband, Nathan Andersen.<br/>12.

Also in season six, Jennifer returns twice as a special guest star.<br/>19. In May 2011, CBS chose not to renew Rachel Nichols' contract for season seven (2011-12), due to her character's negative reception from fans.<br/>20. The cause of A. J. Cook's and Paget Brewster's departure was CBS making a controversial decision to release them from their contracts, which caused numerous angry letters sent from the fans to the studio.<br/>21. Because of this, A. J. Cook and Paget Brewster were re-hired by CBS, reprising as Jennifer Jareau and Emily Prentiss, respectively.<br/>22. In February 2012, Paget Brewster announced her departure from the show after season seven and is replaced in season eight (2012-13) by Alex Blake (Jeanne Tripplehorn), a professor at Georgetown University.<br/>23.

After the initial wave of revolutionary narratives, Soviet historians worked within “narrow guidelines” defined by the Soviet government.<br/>5. The rigidity of interpretive possibilities reached its height under Joseph Stalin.Soviet historians of the October Revolution interpreted the Revolution so as to establish the legitimacy of Marxist ideology, and also the Bolshevik regime.<br/>6. To establish the accuracy of Marxist ideology, Soviet historians generally described the Revolution as the product of class struggle.<br/>7. They maintained that the Revolution was the supreme event in a world history governed by historical laws.<br/>8. The Bolshevik Party is placed at the center of the Revolution, exposing the errors of both the moderate Provisional Government and the spurious “socialist” Mensheviks in the Petrograd Soviet.<br/>9. Guided by Vladimir Lenin's leadership and his firm grasp of scientific Marxist theory, the Party led the “logically predetermined” events of the October Revolution from beginning to end.<br/>10. The events were, according to these historians, logically predetermined because of the socio-economic development of Russia, where the monopoly industrial capitalism alienated the masses.<br/>11. In this view, the Bolshevik party took the leading role in organizing these alienated industrial workers, and thereby established the construction of the first socialist state.Although Soviet historiography of the October Revolution stayed relatively constant until 1991, it did undergo some changes.<br/>12. Following Stalin’s death, historians such as E. N. Burdzhalov and P. V. Volobuev published historical research that deviated significantly from the party line in refining the doctrine that the Bolshevik victory “was predetermined by the state of Russia’s socio-economic development”.<br/>13. These historians, who comprised the “New Directions Group”, posited that the complex nature of the October Revolution “could only be explained by a multi-causal analysis, not by recourse to the mono-causality of monopoly capitalism”.<br/>14. For them, the central actor is still the Bolshevik party, but this party triumphed “because it alone could solve the preponderance of ‘general democratic’ tasks the country faced” (such as the struggle for peace, the exploitation of landlords, and so on.<br/>15. )During the late Soviet period, the opening of select Soviet archives during glasnost sparked innovative research that broke away from some aspects of Marxism-Leninism, though the key features of the orthodox Soviet view remained intact.<br/>","12, 13, 14",How did Stalin's death affect some historians' views on the Bolshevik victory?,,

The photons of a light beam have a characteristic energy proportional to the frequency of the light.<br/>2. In the photoemission process, if an electron within some material absorbs the energy of one photon and acquires more energy than the work function (the electron binding energy) of the material, it is ejected.<br/>3. If the photon energy is too low, the electron is unable to escape the material.<br/>4. Since an increase in the intensity of low-frequency light will only increase the number of low-energy photons sent over a given interval of time, this change in intensity will not create any single photon with enough energy to dislodge an electron.<br/>5. Thus, the energy of the emitted electrons does not depend on the intensity of the incoming light, but only on the energy (equivalently frequency) of the individual photons.<br/>6. It is an interaction between the incident photon and the outermost electrons.Electrons can absorb energy from photons when irradiated, but they usually follow an ""all or nothing"" principle.<br/>7. All of the energy from one photon must be absorbed and used to liberate one electron from atomic binding, or else the energy is re-emitted.<br/>8.

Less common are closed circuit (CCR) and semi-closed (SCR) rebreathers, which unlike open-circuit sets that vent off all exhaled gases, process all or part of each exhaled breath for re-use by removing the carbon dioxide and replacing the oxygen used by the diver.Rebreathers release little or no gas bubbles into the water, and use much less stored gas volume, for an equivalent depth and time because exhaled oxygen is recovered; this has advantages for research, military, photography, and other applications.<br/>2. Rebreathers are more complex and more expensive than open-circuit scuba, and special training and correct maintenance are required for them to be safely used, due to the larger variety of potential failure modes.In a closed-circuit rebreather the oxygen partial pressure in the rebreather is controlled, so it can be maintained at a safe continuous maximum, which reduces the inert gas (nitrogen and/or helium) partial pressure in the breathing loop.<br/>3. Minimising the inert gas loading of the diver's tissues for a given dive profile reduces the decompression obligation.<br/>4. This requires continuous monitoring of actual partial pressures with time and for maximum effectiveness requires real-time computer processing by the diver's decompression computer.<br/>5. Decompression can be much reduced compared to fixed ratio gas mixes used in other scuba systems and, as a result, divers can stay down longer or require less time to decompress.<br/>6. A semi-closed circuit rebreather injects a constant mass flow of a fixed breathing gas mixture into the breathing loop, or replaces a specific percentage of the respired volume, so the partial pressure of oxygen at any time during the dive depends on the diver's oxygen consumption and/or breathing rate.<br/>7. Planning decompression requirements requires a more conservative approach for a SCR than for a CCR, but decompression computers with a real time oxygen partial pressure input can optimise decompression for these systems.Because rebreathers produce very few bubbles, they do not disturb marine life or make a diver’s presence known at the surface; this is useful for underwater photography, and for covert work.<br/>",7,Why are rebreathers useful for such things as underwater photography and covert work?,,

He had worked as a school teacher and as a bank worker but in 1913 and 1914 he lived with, and outwardly off, his mother, who operated a small boarding house in Sarajevo.<br/>3. Secretly, Ilić was leader of the Serbian-irredentist Black Hand cell in Sarajevo.<br/>4. In late 1913, Danilo Ilić came to the Serbian listening post at Užice to speak to the officer in charge, Serbian Colonel C. A. Popović, who was a captain at the time and a member of the Black Hand.<br/>5. Ilić recommended an end to the period of revolutionary organization building and a move to direct action against Austria-Hungary.<br/>6. Popović passed Danilo Ilić on to Belgrade to discuss this matter with Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijević, known more commonly as Apis.<br/>7. By 1913, Apis and his fellow military conspirators (drawn heavily from the ranks of the May 1903 coup) had come to dominate what was left of the Black Hand.There are no reports as to what took place between Ilić and Apis, but soon after their meeting, Apis's righthand man and fellow Black Hander, Serbian Major Vojislav Tankosić, who by this time was in charge of guerrilla training, called a Serbian irredentist planning meeting in Toulouse, France.<br/>8. Amongst those summoned to the Toulouse meeting was Muhamed Mehmedbašić, a carpenter by trade and son of an impoverished Muslim noble from Herzegovina.<br/>9. He too was a member of the Black Hand, having been sworn into the organization by Black Hand Provincial Director for Bosnia-Herzegovina Vladimir Gacinović and Danilo Ilić.<br/>10. Mehmedbašić was (here quoting Albertini paraphrasing Mehmedbašić) ""eager to carry out an act of terrorism to revive the revolutionary spirit of Bosnia.""<br/>11. During this January 1914 meeting, various possible Austro-Hungarian targets for assassination were discussed, including Franz Ferdinand.<br/>12. However, the participants decided only to dispatch Mehmed Mehmedbašić to Sarajevo, to kill the Governor of Bosnia, Oskar Potiorek.On his way to Bosnia-Herzegovina from France, police searched Mehmedbašić's train for a thief.<br/>13.

Over a quarter of all the bird species found in the United States have been seen in Central Park.<br/>7. One of these species is the Red-tailed hawk, which re-established a presence in the park when a male hawk known as Pale Male for his light coloration, nested on a building on Fifth Avenue, across the street from the park.<br/>8. He became a local media celebrity and a prolific breeder.<br/>9. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Central Park was the site of the misguided unleashing of European starlings in North America, a native of Eurasia which has become an invasive species.<br/>10. In April, 1890, eighty birds were released by Eugene Schieffelin, and the following March another eighty; these one hundred and sixty birds are the progenitors of the flocks which now span the United States and parts of Canada.<br/>11. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mammals<br/>12. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Raccoon (""Procyon lotor""): nocturnal tree dwellers that come down to ground level to feed at night, have become extremely common in Central Park in recent years, prompting the Parks Department to post rabies warnings around certain areas.<br/>13. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Eastern gray squirrel, or grey squirrel (""Sciurus carolinensis""), is a tree squirrel in the genus Sciurus native to the eastern and midwestern United States.<br/>14. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Eastern Chipmunk (""Tamias striatus""): although not commonly sighted, there are chipmunks in Central Park.<br/>15. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Virginia Opossum (""Didelphis virginiana""): a nocturnal marsupial that rests in trees during the day and searches for food on the ground at night.<br/>16. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arthropods: In 2002 a new genus and species of centipede (""Nannarrup hoffmani"") was discovered in Central Park.<br/>17.

The site's consensus states: ""Anchored by another tremendous performance in a career full of them, ""All Is Lost"" offers a moving, eminently worthwhile testament to Robert Redford's ability to hold the screen.""<br/>5. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 based on reviews from critics, the film has a score of 87 based on 45 reviews, considered to be ""universal acclaim"".After the screening of the film at the Cannes Film Festival, Redford received a standing ovation.<br/>6.

Andrew Pulver, writing for ""The Guardian"", said that ""Redford delivers a tour de force performance: holding the screen effortlessly with no acting support whatsoever.""<br/>8. Justin Chang of ""Variety"" said of Redford's performance that he ""holds the viewer’s attention merely by wincing, scowling, troubleshooting and yelling the occasional expletive"".<br/>9. Robbie Collin of ""The Telegraph"" said, ""The film's scope is limited, but as far as it goes, ""All Is Lost"" is very good indeed: a neat idea, very nimbly executed.<br/>10. ""Peter Bradshaw writing also for The Guardian says the ""near-mute performance as a mysterious old man of the sea"" to be ""a bold, gripping thriller.""<br/>11. Being an ambiguous and challenging metaphor, he concludes: “What a strikingly bold and thoughtful film.”Alan Scherstuhl of ""The Village Voice"" writes that the film is ""a genuine nail-biter, scrupulously made and fully involving, elemental in its simplicity.""<br/>12. David Morgan of CBS News gave the film a positive review, stating, ""Four decades ago Redford demonstrated a similar capacity for survival skills as the mountain man Jeremiah Johnson.<br/>13. Today, at age 77, without a supporting cast and performing virtually all of his water stunts himself, Redford proves he is still up to the task, shining in what is an extremely physical but also an intellectually demanding role.<br/>14. ""Steve Pulaski of ""Influx Magazine"" gave the film an A-, commenting, """"All is Lost"" is a strong film in terms of mood and score.<br/>15. I have no idea what audiences will think of it.<br/>16.
