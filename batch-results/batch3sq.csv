The sessions for that year's ""The Beatles"" (commonly known as the ""White Album"") had seen a number of serious arguments and strained relations among the group.<br/>3. McCartney felt that the group's cohesiveness had been lost through years without playing live, and from using the studio not to record ensemble performances but to make increasingly complex recordings made up of parts played individually by each Beatle as overdubs rather than as a group.<br/>4. He believed that the best way to improve band relations and revive enthusiasm was to get the group back into rehearsal as quickly as possible (the ""White Album"" sessions having only been concluded in October 1968) and begin work on a new album that made little or no use of studio artifice or multiple overdubbing.<br/>5. This would allow the group to return to their roots by playing as a true ensemble, perhaps recording some or all of the new album during a one-off live concert or full concert tour.<br/>6. This idea mirrored the ""back to basics"" attitude of a number of rock musicians at this time in reaction against the psychedelic and progressive music dominant in the previous two years.<br/>7. McCartney believed that a return to live performance would reinstill the same sort of ensemble spirit and sense of unity that they had in their early years together.McCartney also decided to invite producer/engineer Glyn Johns to contribute to the recording.<br/>8. His proposed role was apparently not clearly defined, as McCartney also wished to retain the services of George Martin.<br/>9. As a result, Johns was not entirely sure whether he was supposed to be producing (or co-producing) the album or merely engineering it, with Martin having no clear idea of where he stood either.The other three Beatles were less enthusiastic about McCartney's proposals.<br/>10. They had just completed five months' work on their previous album and were skeptical about the prospects of returning to live performance.<br/>11. George Harrison in particular was very opposed to the idea of touring, having taken the strongest dislike out of any in the group due to the grueling tours of the Beatlemania era.<br/>12. However he had recently enjoyed a series of jam sessions with Bob Dylan and the Band in the US, rediscovering his liking for straightforward ensemble playing, and he was attracted to the idea of the ""back to basics"" approach.<br/>13. The same approach greatly appealed to John Lennon, who had grown increasingly wary of what he regarded as the excessive technical artifice used on their recordings since ""Revolver"" and had also made a recent return to no-frills ensemble playing in the shape of an appearance on ""The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus"".<br/>14. In addition, all the group members had greatly enjoyed the recording of Lennon's song ""Happiness is a Warm Gun"" during the recent ""White Album"" sessions which, due to its multiple sections and myriad time signature changes, had required the Beatles to focus sharply and revive their ensemble playing skills to lay down a coherent basic rhythm track before any overdubbing could be applied.<br/>15. In the end, the group agreed to convene for rehearsals immediately following New Year's Day 1969 to begin work, even though no suitable conclusion or even firm direction for the new project had been agreed upon.<br/>",7,Which producer/engineer did McCartney invite to contribute to the recording?,,

""Hey Jude"" was released on 26 August 1968 in the United States and 30 August in the United Kingdom, backed with ""Revolution"" on the B-side of a 7"" single.<br/>3. The single was the debut release of the Beatles' record label Apple Records; in the US, it was also the first Beatles' single to be issued in a company sleeve rather than a picture sleeve.<br/>4. Even though ""Hey Jude"" was recorded during the sessions for the album ""The Beatles"", also known as the White Album, it was always intended as a single and not an album track, although it would eventually make its LP debut two years later as the title cut on the compilation album originally titled ""The Beatles Again"".<br/>5. Lennon wanted ""Revolution"" to be the A-side of the single, but the other Beatles did not agree.<br/>6. In his 1970 interview with ""Rolling Stone"", he said ""Hey Jude"" was worthy of an A-side, ""but we could have had both.""<br/>7. Ten years later in 1980, he told ""Playboy"" he still disagreed with the decision.<br/>8. ""Hey Jude"" began its sixteen-week run on the British charts on 7 September 1968, claiming the top spot a week later.<br/>9. It only lasted two weeks on top before being knocked off by another single from Apple, Mary Hopkin's ""Those Were the Days"" (a song which, incidentally, if not penned was actually produced by McCartney).<br/>10. The single was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on 13 September; that same week ""NME"" reported that two million copies of the single had been sold.<br/>11. The song entered the US charts on 14 September 1968, where it stayed for nineteen weeks.<br/>12. Two weeks later, ""Hey Jude"" was number one in the charts and held that position for nine weeks, the longest time spent by a Beatles' single at number one, as well as being the longest-playing single to reach number one.<br/>13.

""Hey Jude"" became the biggest-selling debut release for a record label ever, selling an estimated eight million copies worldwide and topping the charts in eleven countries.<br/>18. ""Hey Jude"" was the top Billboard Hot 100 single for 1968, according to year-end charts.<br/>19. Less than three weeks after its release, the record was certified gold for sales of one million copies.<br/>20.

An uptempo love song, the instrumentation includes bell chimes and heavy back-up vocals, as well as use of synthesizers.<br/>5. The song's lyrics declare that the protagonist does not care about Christmas presents or lights; all she wants for Christmas is to be united with her lover for the holidays.Two music videos were commissioned for the song, both being filmed during the month of December 1993.<br/>6. The song's primary music video features grainy home footage of Carey, her dogs and family during the holiday season, as well as Carey dressed in a Santa suit frolicking on a snowy mountainside.<br/>7. Then husband Tommy Mottola makes a cameo appearance as Santa Claus, bringing Carey a gift and leaving on a red sleigh.<br/>8. The second video was filmed in black and white format, and features Carey dressed in 1960s style, while paying homage to The Ronettes, alongside back up singers and male dancers.Carey performed ""All I Want for Christmas is You"" during a slew of live television appearances and tours throughout her career.<br/>9. She first sang it live during the Japanese leg of her Daydream World Tour (1996), Butterfly World Tour (1998) and (2003–04), as well as the Walt Disney World Christmas Day Parade in 2004 and 2010.<br/>10.

When presented with the original draft lyric, Garland, her co-star Tom Drake and director Vincente Minnelli criticized the song as depressing, and asked Martin to change the lyrics.Though he initially resisted, Martin made several changes to make the song more upbeat.<br/>4. For example, the lines ""It may be your last / Next year we may all be living in the past"" became ""Let your heart be light / Next year all our troubles will be out of sight"".<br/>5. <strike>Garland's version of the song, which was also released as a single by Decca Records, became popular among United States troops serving in World War II; her performance at the Hollywood Canteen brought many soldiers to tears.In 1957, Frank Sinatra asked Martin to revise the line ""Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow.""</strike><br/>6.

On ""The Judy Garland Show Christmas Special"", Garland sings the song to her children Joey and Lorna Luft with Sinatra's alternate lyrics.The lyrics Garland sang in ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" have been recorded with only slight variations by a number of artists, including Sinatra himself (in 1950 and 1963 single recordings), Doris Day (in ""The Doris Day Christmas Album""), Ella Fitzgerald (in ""Ella Wishes You a Swinging Christmas""), James Taylor (in ""October Road""), The Pretenders in the first ""A Very Special Christmas"" compilation released in 1987 (which benefits Special Olympics), and Luther Vandross (in ""This Is Christmas"").In 2001 the 86-year-old composer Hugh Martin, occasionally active as a pianist with religious ministries since the 1980s, wrote an entirely new set of lyrics to the song with John Fricke, ""Have Yourself a Blessed Little Christmas,"" a religious version of the secular Christmas standard.<br/>11. The song was recorded by gospel female vocalist Del Delker with Martin accompanying her on piano.In 2002, NewSong lead singer Michael O'Brien noted the line ""through the years, we all will be together if the Lord allows,"" which was part of the original song, was purged and replaced with ""if the fates allow"" to remove religious reference when the song was released.<br/>12. He noted while a pastor in a California church in 1990, he had met Martin, who played piano at the church where O'Brien was serving for an evening, and the pastor was told, ""That's the original way I wrote it, so I want you to sing it this way.""<br/>13.

It has been suggested that the transmission of the first episode was delayed by ten minutes due to extended news coverage of the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy the previous day; whereas in fact, it went out just eighty seconds late.<br/>2. Because it was believed that the coverage of the events of the assassination as well as a series of power blackouts across the country may have caused too many viewers to miss this introduction to a new series, the BBC broadcast it again on 30 November 1963, just before the broadcast of episode two.The programme soon became a national institution in the United Kingdom, with a large following among the general viewing audience.<br/>3. Many renowned actors asked for, or were offered and accepted, guest-starring roles in various stories.With popularity came controversy over the show's suitability for children.<br/>4. <strike>Morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse repeatedly complained to the BBC in the 1970s over what she saw as the show's frightening and gory content.</strike><br/>5. John Nathan-Turner, who produced the series during the 1980s, was heard to say that he looked forward to Whitehouse's comments, as the show's ratings would increase soon after she had made them.The phrase ""Hiding behind (or 'watching from behind') the sofa"" became coined and entered British pop culture, signifying in humour the stereotypical early-series behaviour of children who wanted to avoid seeing frightening parts of a television programme while remaining in the room to watch the remainder of it.<br/>6. The phrase retains this association with Doctor Who, to the point that in 1991 the Museum of the Moving Image in London named their exhibition celebrating the programme ""Behind the Sofa"".<br/>7. The electronic theme music too was perceived as eerie, novel, and frightening, at the time.<br/>8. A 2012 article placed this childhood juxtapose of fear and thrill ""at the center of many people's relationship with the show"", and a 2011 online vote at Digital Spy deemed the series the ""scariest TV show of all time"".During Jon Pertwee's second series as the Doctor, in the serial ""Terror of the Autons"" (1971), images of murderous plastic dolls, daffodils killing unsuspecting victims, and blank-featured policemen marked the apex of the show's ability to frighten children.<br/>9. Other notable moments in that decade include a disembodied brain falling to the floor in ""The Brain of Morbius"" and the Doctor apparently being drowned by Chancellor Goth in ""The Deadly Assassin"" (both 1976).A BBC audience research survey conducted in 1972 found that, by their own definition of violence (""any act which may cause physical and/or psychological injury, hurt or death to persons, animals or property, whether intentional or accidental"") ""Doctor Who"" was the most violent of the drama programmes the corporation produced at the time.<br/>10. The same report found that 3% of the surveyed audience regarded the show as ""very unsuitable"" for family viewing.<br/>11. Responding to the findings of the survey in ""The Times"" newspaper, journalist Philip Howard maintained that, ""to compare the violence of ""Dr Who"", sired by a horse-laugh out of a nightmare, with the more realistic violence of other television series, where actors who look like human beings bleed paint that looks like blood, is like comparing Monopoly with the property market in London: both are fantasies, but one is meant to be taken seriously.<br/>12. ""The image of the TARDIS has become firmly linked to the show in the public's consciousness; BBC scriptwriter Anthony Coburn, who lived in the resort of Herne Bay, Kent, was one of the people who conceived the idea of a police box as a time machine.<br/>13. In 1996, the BBC applied for a trade mark to use the TARDIS's blue police box design in merchandising associated with ""Doctor Who"".<br/>14. In 1998, the Metropolitan Police Authority filed an objection to the trade mark claim; but in 2002, the Patent Office ruled in favour of the BBC.</ref>The programme's broad appeal attracts audiences of children and families as well as science fiction fans.The 21st century revival of the programme has become the centrepiece of BBC One's Saturday schedule, and has, ""defined the channel"".<br/>15. Since its return, ""Doctor Who"" has consistently received high ratings, both in number of viewers and as measured by the Appreciation Index.<br/>16. In 2007, Caitlin Moran, television reviewer for ""The Times"", wrote that ""Doctor Who"" is, ""quintessential to being British"".<br/>17. Director Steven Spielberg has commented that, ""the world would be a poorer place without ""Doctor Who"""".On 4 August 2013, a live programme titled ""Doctor Who Live: The Next Doctor"" was broadcast on BBC One, during which the actor playing the Twelfth Doctor was revealed.<br/>18. The show was simultaneously broadcast in the US and Australia.<br/>",13,When did BBC apply for the TARDIS trademark?,,

Over 3.7 million people visit Yosemite each year: most spend their time in the seven square miles (18 km2) of Yosemite Valley.<br/>4. Designated a World Heritage Site in 1984, Yosemite is internationally recognized for its spectacular granite cliffs, waterfalls, clear streams, Giant Sequoia groves, and biological diversity.<br/>5. Almost 95% of the park is designated wilderness.<br/>6. Yosemite was central to the development of the national park idea.<br/>7. First, Galen Clark and others lobbied to protect Yosemite Valley from development, ultimately leading to President Abraham Lincoln's signing the Yosemite Grant in 1864.<br/>8. Later, John Muir led a successful movement to establish a larger national park encompassing not just the valley, but surrounding mountains and forests as well - paving the way for the United States national park system.Yosemite is one of the largest and least fragmented habitat blocks in the Sierra Nevada, and the park supports a diversity of plants and animals.<br/>9. The park has an elevation range from and contains five major vegetation zones: chaparral/oak woodland, lower montane forest, upper montane forest, subalpine zone, and alpine.<br/>10. Of California's 7,000 plant species, about 50% occur in the Sierra Nevada and more than 20% within Yosemite.<br/>11. There is suitable habitat or documentation for more than 160 rare plants in the park, with rare local geologic formations and unique soils characterizing the restricted ranges many of these plants occupy.The geology of the Yosemite area is characterized by granitic rocks and remnants of older rock.<br/>12. About 10 million years ago, the Sierra Nevada was uplifted and then tilted to form its relatively gentle western slopes and the more dramatic eastern slopes.<br/>13. The uplift increased the steepness of stream and river beds, resulting in formation of deep, narrow canyons.<br/>14. About 1 million years ago, snow and ice accumulated, forming glaciers at the higher alpine meadows that moved down the river valleys.<br/>15. Ice thickness in Yosemite Valley may have reached during the early glacial episode.<br/>16. The downslope movement of the ice masses cut and sculpted the U-shaped valley that attracts so many visitors to its scenic vistas today.<br/>",7,Which president signed the Yosemite Grant in 1864?,,

These rock layers record much of the early geologic history of the North American continent.Uplift associated with mountain formation later moved these sediments thousands of feet upward and created the Colorado Plateau.<br/>5. The higher elevation has also resulted in greater precipitation in the Colorado River drainage area, but not enough to change the Grand Canyon area from being semi-arid.<br/>6. The uplift of the Colorado Plateau is uneven, and the Kaibab Plateau that Grand Canyon bisects is over a thousand feet higher at the North Rim (about ) than at the South Rim.<br/>7.

The Munch Museum holds the other painted version (1910, see gallery) and a pastel version from 1893.<br/>7. These three versions have not traveled for years.<br/>8. The fourth version (pastel, 1895) was sold for $119,922,600 at Sotheby's Impressionist and Modern Art auction on 2 May 2012 to financier Leon Black, the second highest nominal price paid for a painting at auction.<br/>9. The painting was on display in the Museum of Modern Art in New York from October 2012 to April 2013.Also in 1895, Munch created a lithograph stone of the image.<br/>10. Of the lithograph prints produced by Munch, several examples survive.<br/>11. Only approximately four dozen prints were made before the original stone was resurfaced by the printer in Munch's absence.<br/>12. ""The Scream"" has been the target of several high-profile art thefts.<br/>13. In 1994, the version in the National Gallery was stolen.<br/>14.

Wood entered the painting in a competition at the Art Institute of Chicago.<br/>2. The judges deemed it a ""comic valentine"", but a museum patron persuaded them to award the painting the bronze medal and $300 cash prize.<br/>3. The patron also persuaded the Art Institute to buy the painting, which remains there today.<br/>4. The image soon began to be reproduced in newspapers, first by the ""Chicago Evening Post"" and then in New York, Boston, Kansas City, and Indianapolis.<br/>5. However, Wood received a backlash when the image finally appeared in the ""Cedar Rapids Gazette"".<br/>6. Iowans were furious at their depiction as ""pinched, grim-faced, puritanical Bible-thumpers"".<br/>7. Wood protested that he had not painted a caricature of Iowans but a depiction of his appreciation, stating ""I had to go to France to appreciate Iowa.""<br/>8. Nan, apparently embarrassed at being depicted as the wife of someone twice her age, began telling people that the painting was of a man and his daughter, which Grant seems to confirm in his letter to a Mrs. Nellie Sudduth in 1941.Art critics who had favorable opinions about the painting, such as Gertrude Stein and Christopher Morley, also assumed the painting was meant to be a satire of rural small-town life.<br/>9. It was thus seen as part of the trend toward increasingly critical depictions of rural America, along the lines of Sherwood Anderson's 1919 ""Winesburg, Ohio"", Sinclair Lewis's 1920 ""Main Street"", and Carl Van Vechten's 1924 ""The Tattooed Countess"" in literature.<br/>10. Yet another interpretation sees it as an ""old-fashioned mourning portrait... Tellingly, the curtains hanging in the windows of the house, both upstairs and down, are pulled closed in the middle of the day, a mourning custom in Victorian America.<br/>11.

Wood assisted this transition by renouncing his Bohemian youth in Paris and grouping himself with populist Midwestern painters, such as John Steuart Curry and Thomas Hart Benton, who revolted against the dominance of East Coast art circles.<br/>14.

He reworked the original as well as completed numerous preliminary drawings and oil sketches.<br/>3. He sat in the park, creating numerous sketches of the various figures in order to perfect their form.<br/>4. He concentrated on the issues of colour, light, and form.<br/>5. The painting is approximately 2 by 3 meters (7 by 10 feet) in size.Motivated by study in optical and color theory, Seurat contrasted miniature dots or small brushstrokes of colors that when unified optically in the human eye were perceived as a single shade or hue.<br/>6. He believed that this form of painting, called divisionism at the time but now known as pointillism, would make the colors more brilliant and powerful than standard brush strokes.<br/>7. The use of dots of almost uniform size came in the second year of his work on the painting, 1885–86.<br/>8. To make the experience of the painting even more vivid, he surrounded it with a frame of painted dots, which in turn he enclosed with a pure white, wooden frame, which is how the painting is exhibited today at the Art Institute of Chicago.In creating the picture, Seurat employed the then-new pigment zinc yellow (zinc chromate), most visibly for yellow highlights on the lawn in the painting, but also in mixtures with orange and blue pigments.<br/>9. In the century and more since the painting's completion, the zinc yellow has darkened to brown — a colour degeneration that was already showing in the painting in Seurat's lifetime.The island of la Grande Jatte is located at the very gates of Paris, lying in the Seine between Neuilly and Levallois-Perret, a short distance from where currently stands La Défense business district.<br/>10. Although for many years it was an industrial site, it is today the site of a public garden and a housing development.<br/>11. When Seurat began the painting in 1884, the island was a bucolic retreat far from the urban center.The painting was first exhibited in 1886, dominating the second Salon of the Société des Artistes Indépendants, of which Seurat had been a founder in 1884.<br/>",11,When did Seurat begin the painting?,,

Many paintings of gaunt mothers with children date from the Blue Period, during which Picasso divided his time between Barcelona and Paris.<br/>3. In his austere use of color and sometimes doleful subject matter – prostitutes and beggars are frequent subjects – Picasso was influenced by a trip through Spain and by the suicide of his friend Carlos Casagemas.<br/>4. Starting in autumn of 1901 he painted several posthumous portraits of Casagemas, culminating in the gloomy allegorical painting ""La Vie"" (1903), now in the Cleveland Museum of Art.The same mood pervades the well-known etching ""The Frugal Repast"" (1904), which depicts a blind man and a sighted woman, both emaciated, seated at a nearly bare table.<br/>5. <strike>Blindness is a recurrent theme in Picasso's works of this period, also represented in ""The Blindman's Meal"" (1903, the Metropolitan Museum of Art) and in the portrait of ""Celestina"" (1903).</strike><br/>6.

The project that at first seemed most advanced was a joint venture between Barbra Streisand's Barwood Films and Robert De Niro's TriBeCa Productions (De Niro's parents were friends of Krasner and Pollock).<br/>3. The script, by Christopher Cleveland, was to be based on Jeffrey Potter's 1985 oral biography, ""To a Violent Grave,"" a collection of reminiscences by Pollock's friends.<br/>4.

He grew up in Bohain-en-Vermandois, Picardie, France.<br/>3. In 1887 he went to Paris to study law, working as a court administrator in Le Cateau-Cambrésis after gaining his qualification.<br/>4. He first started to paint in 1889, after his mother brought him art supplies during a period of convalescence following an attack of appendicitis.<br/>5. He discovered ""a kind of paradise"" as he later described it, and decided to become an artist, deeply disappointing his father.<br/>6. In 1891, he returned to Paris to study art at the Académie Julian and became a student of William-Adolphe Bouguereau and Gustave Moreau.<br/>7. Initially he painted still-lifes and landscapes in a traditional style, at which he achieved reasonable proficiency.<br/>8. Matisse was influenced by the works of earlier masters such as Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin, Nicolas Poussin, and Antoine Watteau, as well as by modern artists such as Édouard Manet, and by Japanese art.<br/>9. Chardin was one of the painters Matisse most admired; as an art student he made copies of four of Chardin's paintings in the Louvre.In 1896 and 1897, Matisse visited the Australian painter John Peter Russell on the island Belle Île off the coast of Brittany.<br/>10. Russell introduced him to Impressionism and to the work of van Gogh, who had been a friend of Russell but was completely unknown at the time.<br/>11. Matisse's style changed completely, and he would later say ""Russell was my teacher, and Russell explained colour theory to me.""<br/>12. In 1896 Matisse exhibited five paintings in the salon of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, two of which were purchased by the state.With the model Caroline Joblau, he had a daughter, Marguerite, born in 1894.<br/>13. In 1898 he married Amélie Noellie Parayre; the two raised Marguerite together and had two sons, Jean (born 1899) and Pierre (born 1900).<br/>14. Marguerite and Amélie often served as models for Matisse.In 1898, on the advice of Camille Pissarro, he went to London to study the paintings of J. M. W. Turner and then went on a trip to Corsica.<br/>15. Upon his return to Paris in February 1899, he worked beside Albert Marquet and met André Derain, Jean Puy, and Jules Flandrin.<br/>16. Matisse immersed himself in the work of others and went into debt from buying work from painters he admired.<br/>17. The work he hung and displayed in his home included a plaster bust by Rodin, a painting by Gauguin, a drawing by van Gogh, and Cézanne's ""Three Bathers"".<br/>18. In Cézanne's sense of pictorial structure and colour, Matisse found his main inspiration.Many of Matisse's paintings from 1898 to 1901 make use of a Divisionist technique he adopted after reading Paul Signac's essay, ""D'Eugène Delacroix au Néo-impressionisme"".<br/>19. His paintings of 1902–03, a period of material hardship for the artist, are comparatively somber and reveal a preoccupation with form.<br/>20. Having made his first attempt at sculpture, a copy after Antoine-Louis Barye, in 1899, he devoted much of his energy to working in clay, completing ""The Slave"" in 1903.<br/>",2,Where did Henri Matisse grow up?,,

At most levels of organized play, two coaches are stationed on the field when the team is at bat: the first base coach and third base coach, occupying designated coaches' boxes just outside the foul lines, assist in the direction of baserunners when the ball is in play, and relay tactical signals from the manager to batters and runners during pauses in play.<br/>4. In contrast to many other team sports, baseball managers and coaches generally wear their team's uniforms; coaches must be in uniform in order to be allowed on the playing field during a game.Any baseball game involves one or more umpires, who make rulings on the outcome of each play.<br/>5. At a minimum, one umpire will stand behind the catcher, to have a good view of the strike zone, and call balls and strikes.<br/>6.

Basketball is a sport played by two teams of five players on a rectangular court.<br/>2. The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop in diameter and high mounted to a backboard at each end.<br/>3. Basketball is one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports.A team can score a field goal by shooting the ball through the basket during regular play.<br/>4. A field goal scores two points for the shooting team if a player is touching or closer to the basket than the three-point line, and three points (known commonly as a ""3 pointer"" or ""three"") if the player is behind the three-point line.<br/>5. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but additional time (overtime) may be issued when the game ends with a draw.<br/>6. The ball can be advanced on the court by bouncing it while walking or running or throwing it to a team mate.<br/>7. It is a violation to move without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.Violations are called ""fouls"".<br/>8. A personal foul is penalized, and a free throw is usually awarded to an offensive player if he is fouled while shooting the ball.<br/>9. <strike>A technical foul may also be issued when certain infractions occur, most commonly for unsportsmanlike conduct on the part of a player or coach.</strike><br/>10. A technical foul gives the opposing team a free throw, and the opposing team also retains possession of the ball.As well as many techniques for shooting, passing, dribbling and rebounding, basketball has specialized player positions and offensive and defensive structures (player positioning).<br/>11.

Woods are large-headed, long-shafted clubs meant to propel the ball a long distance from relatively ""open"" lies, such as the tee box and fairway.<br/>6. Of particular importance is the ""driver"" or ""1-wood"", which is the lowest lofted wood club, and in modern times has become highly specialized for making extremely long-distance tee shots, up to or more in the hands of a professional golfer.<br/>7. Traditionally these clubs had heads made of a hardwood, hence the name, but virtually all modern woods are now made of metal such as titanium, or of composite materials.<br/>8. <strike>Irons are shorter-shafted clubs with a metal head primarily consisting of a flat, angled striking face.</strike><br/>9. Traditionally the clubhead was forged from iron; modern iron clubheads are investment-cast from a steel alloy.<br/>10. Irons of varying loft are used for a variety of shots from virtually anywhere on the course, but most often for shorter-distance shots approaching the green, or to get the ball out of tricky lies such as sand traps.<br/>11. The third class is the putter, which evolved from the irons to create a low-lofted, balanced club designed to roll the ball along the green and into the hole.<br/>12. Putters are virtually always used on the green or in the surrounding rough/fringe.<br/>13. A fourth class, called hybrids, evolved as a cross between woods and irons, and are typically seen replacing the low-lofted irons with a club that provides similar distance, but a higher launch angle and a more forgiving nature.A maximum of 14 clubs is allowed in a player's bag at one time during a stipulated round.<br/>14. The choice of clubs is at the golfer's discretion, although every club must be constructed in accordance with parameters outlined in the rules.<br/>15. (Clubs that meet these parameters are usually called ""conforming"".)<br/>16. Violation of these rules can result in disqualification.The exact shot hit at any given time on a golf course, and which club is used to accomplish the shot, are always completely at the discretion of the golfer; in other words, there is no restriction whatsoever on which club a golfer may or may not use at any time for any shot.Golf balls are spherical, usually white (although other colors are allowed), and minutely pock-marked by dimples that decrease aerodynamic drag by increasing air turbulence around the ball in motion, which delays ""boundary layer"" separation and reduces the drag-inducing ""wake"" behind the ball,thereby allowing the ball to fly farther.A tee is allowed only for the first stroke on each hole, unless the player must hit a provisional tee shot or replay his or her first shot from the tee.Many golfers wear golf shoes with metal or plastic spikes designed to increase traction, thus allowing for longer and more accurate shots.<br/>17. A golf bag is used to transport golf clubs and the player's other or personal equipment.<br/>18. Golf bags have several pockets designed for carrying equipment and supplies such as tees, balls, and gloves.<br/>19. Golf bags can be carried, pulled on a trolley or harnessed to a motorized golf cart during play.<br/>20. Golf bags have both a hand strap and shoulder strap for carrying, and sometimes have retractable legs that allow the bag to stand upright when at rest.<br/>",1,The golf club is used for what?,,

Smashing tends to be less prominent in singles than in doubles because the smasher has no partner to follow up his effort and is thus vulnerable to a skillfully placed return.<br/>5. Moreover, frequent smashing can be exhausting in singles where the conservation of a player's energy is at a premium.<br/>6.

The Spanish school of fencing stagnated and was replaced by the Italian and French schools.<br/>5. Nowadays, these two schools are the most influential around the world.Dueling went into sharp decline after World War I.<br/>6. After World War II, dueling went out of use in Europe except for very rare exceptions.<br/>7. Training for duels, once fashionable for males of aristocratic backgrounds (although fencing masters such as Hope suggest that many people considered themselves trained from taking only one or two lessons), all but disappeared, along with the classes themselves.<br/>8. Fencing continued as a sport, with tournaments and championships.<br/>9. However, the need to actually prepare for a duel with ""sharps"" vanished, changing both training and technique.Starting with épée in 1936, side-judges were replaced by an electrical scoring apparatus, with an audible tone and a red or green light indicating when a touch landed.<br/>10. Foil first embraced electronic scoring in 1956, sabre in 1988.<br/>11. The scoring box reduced the bias in judging, and permitted more accurate scoring of faster actions, lighter touches, and more touches to the back and flank than before.<br/>",1,Where did modern fencing originate from?,,

Dr. Bill O'Neill, boxing spokesman for the British Medical Association, has supported the BMA's proposed ban on boxing: ""It is the only sport where the intention is to inflict serious injury on your opponent, and we feel that we must have a total ban on boxing.""<br/>8. Opponents respond that such a position is misguided opinion, stating that amateur boxing is scored solely according to total connecting blows with no award for ""injury"".<br/>9.

The legend states that he was sent from the battlefield of Marathon to Athens to announce that the Persians had been defeated in the Battle of Marathon (in which he had just fought), which took place in August or September, 490 BC.<br/>3. It is said that he ran the entire distance without stopping and burst into the assembly, exclaiming (""nenikekamen"", ""we have wοn""), before collapsing and dying.<br/>4. <strike>The account of the run from Marathon to Athens first appears in Plutarch's ""On the Glory of Athens"" in the 1st century AD which quotes from Heraclides Ponticus's lost work, giving the runner's name as either Thersipus of Erchius or Eucles.</strike><br/>5. Lucian of Samosata (2nd century AD) also gives the story but names the runner Philippides (not Pheidippides).There is debate about the historical accuracy of this legend.<br/>6. The Greek historian Herodotus, the main source for the Greco-Persian Wars, mentions Pheidippides as the messenger who ran from Athens to Sparta asking for help, and then ran back, a distance of over each way.<br/>7. In some Herodotus manuscripts the name of the runner between Athens and Sparta is given as Philippides.<br/>8. Herodotus makes no mention of a messenger sent from Marathon to Athens, and relates that the main part of the Athenian army, having fought and won the grueling battle, and fearing a naval raid by the Persian fleet against an undefended Athens, marched quickly back from the battle to Athens, arriving the same day.In 1879, Robert Browning wrote the poem .<br/>9. Browning's poem, his composite story, became part of late 19th century popular culture and was accepted as a historic legend.Mount Penteli stands between Marathon and Athens, which means that, if Pheidippides actually made his famous run after the battle, he had to run around the mountain, either to the north or to the south.<br/>10. The latter and more obvious route matches almost exactly the modern Marathon-Athens highway, which follows the lie of the land southwards from Marathon Bay and along the coast, then takes a gentle but protracted climb westwards towards the eastern approach to Athens, between the foothills of Mounts Hymettus and Penteli, and then gently downhill to Athens proper.<br/>11. This route, as it existed when the Olympics were revived in 1896, was approximately long, and this was the approximate distance originally used for marathon races.<br/>12. However there have been suggestions that Pheidippides might have followed another route: a westward climb along the eastern and northern slopes of Mount Penteli to the pass of Dionysos, and then a straight southward downhill path to Athens.<br/>13. This route is considerably shorter, some , but includes a very steep initial climb of more than .<br/>",1,"Where does the name ""marathon"" come from?",,

Although the French people are historically of Celtic, Romantic, and Germanic origin, they are today a mixture of several ethnic groups, due mostly to large-scale immigration over the last century.In 2004, the Institut Montaigne estimated that within Metropolitan France, 51 million people were white (85% of the population), 6 million were North African (10%), 2 million were black (3.5%), and 1 million were Asian (1.5%).A law originating from the 1789 revolution and reaffirmed in the 1958 French Constitution makes it illegal for the French state to collect data on ethnicity and ancestry, although some surveys, such as the TeO (""Trajectories and origins"") poll conducted jointly by INED and INSEE in 2008, are allowed to do so.<br/>3. It was estimated that 5 million people were of Italian ancestry (the most numerous immigrant community), between 3 million and 6 million people are of North African ancestry, 2.5 million people are of Sub-Saharan African origin, 200,000 people are of Turkish ancestry, and many more are of other European ethnic ancestry, namely Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, and Greek.Indeed, it is currently estimated that 40% of the French population is descended at least partially from the different waves of immigration the country has received since the early 20th century; between 1921 and 1935 alone, about 1.1 million net immigrants came to France.<br/>4. The next largest waves came in the 1960s, when around 1.6 million ""pieds noirs"" returned to France following the independence of its North African possessions.France remains a major destination for immigrants, accepting about 200,000 legal immigrants annually.<br/>5. It is also Western Europe's leading recipient of asylum seekers, with an estimated 50,000 applications in 2005 (a 15% decrease from 2004).<br/>6. The European Union allows free movement between the member states, although France established controls to curb Eastern European migration, and immigration remains a contentious political issue.In 2008, the French national institute of statistics INSEE estimated that the total number of foreign-born immigrants was around 5 million (8% of the population), while their French-born descendants numbered 6.5 million, or 11% of the population.<br/>7. Thus, nearly a fifth of the country's population were either first or second-generation immigrants, more than 5 million of European origin and 4 million of Maghrebi origin.<br/>8. In 2008, France granted citizenship to 137,000 persons, mostly to people from Morocco, Algeria and Turkey.France is an outlier among developed countries in general, and European countries in particular, in having a fairly high rate of natural population growth: by birth rates alone, France was responsible for almost all natural population growth in the European Union in 2006, with the natural growth rate (excess of births over deaths) rising to 300,000.<br/>9. This was the highest rate since the end of the baby boom in 1973, and coincides with the rise of the total fertility rate from a nadir of 1.7 in 1994 to 2.0 in 2010.<br/>10. <strike>From 2006 to 2011 population growth was on average +0.6% per year.</strike><br/>11.

His successor was Jânio Quadros, who resigned in 1961 less than a year after taking office.<br/>5. His vice-president, João Goulart, assumed the presidency, but aroused strong political opposition and was deposed in April 1964 by a coup that resulted in a military regime.The new regime was intended to be transitory but it gradually closed in on itself and became a full dictatorship with the promulgation of the Fifth Institutional Act in 1968.<br/>6. The repression was not limited only to those who resorted to guerrilla tactics to fight the regime, but also reached institutional opponents, artists, journalists and other members of civil society, inside and outside the country (through the infamous ""Operation Condor"").<br/>7. Despite its brutality, like other totalitarian regimes in history, due to an economic boom, known as an ""economic miracle"", the regime reached its highest level of popularity in the early 1970s.Slowly however, the wear and tear of years of dictatorial power that has not slowed the repression, even after the defeat of the leftist guerrillas, plus the inability to deal with the economic crises of the period and popular pressure, made it inevitable an opening policy, which of the regime side was led by Generals Geisel and Golbery.<br/>8. With the enactment of the Amnesty Law in 1979, Brazil began to slowly return to democracy, which would be completed along the 1980s.Civilians returned to power in 1985 when José Sarney assumed the presidency, becoming unpopular during his tenure due his failure in control the economic crisis and hyperinflation inherited from the military regime.<br/>9. Sarney's unsuccessful government allowed the election in 1989 of the almost unknown Fernando Collor, who was subsequently impeached by the National Congress in 1992.<br/>10. Collor was succeeded by his Vice-President Itamar Franco, who appointed Fernando Henrique Cardoso as Minister of Finance.<br/>11. In 1994, Cardoso produced a highly successful Plano Real, that after decades of failed economic plans made by previous governments attempting to curb hyperinflation, finally granted stability to the Brazilian economy, leading Cardoso to be elected that year, and again in 1998.The peaceful transition of power from Fernando Henrique to his main opposition leader, Luís Inácio Lula da Silva, who was elected in 2002 and re-elected in 2006, proved that Brazil had finally succeeded in achieving its long-sought political stability.<br/>12. <strike>Lula was succeeded in 2011 by the current president, Dilma Rousseff, the country's first woman president and as such one of the most powerful women in the world.In June 2013, following the viral phenomenon of worldwide manifestations (such as the """"Arab Spring"""", the """"Occupy Wall Street"""" and the """"Spanish Indignados""""), numerous protests erupted in Brazil.</strike><br/>13.

Don Isaac Abrabanel was one of the principal persons of Spain’s Jewish community and one of the king’s trusted courtiers who witnessed the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492.<br/>7. Both men wrote in two different published works that the first Jews to reach Spain were brought by ship by Phiros who was confederate with the king of Babylon when he laid siege to Jerusalem.<br/>8. This man was a Grecian by birth, but who had been given a kingdom in Spain.<br/>9. He became related by marriage to Espan, the nephew of king Heracles, who also ruled over a kingdom in Spain.<br/>10.

Commentators such as science fiction author David Brin have interpreted the work to hold unquestioning devotion to a traditional elitist social structure.<br/>5.

"", and somewhat serves as a parody film, targeting other films adapted from numerous children's fantasies (mainly animated Disney films).<br/>4. The film made notable use of popular music; the soundtrack includes music by Smash Mouth, Eels, Joan Jett, The Proclaimers, Jason Wade, Baha Men, and John Cale (covering Leonard Cohen).The rights to the books were originally bought by Steven Spielberg in 1991, before the founding of DreamWorks, when he thought about making a traditionally animated film based on the book.<br/>5. However, John H. Williams convinced him to bring the film to DreamWorks in 1994, the time the studio was founded, and the film was put quickly into active development by Jeffrey Katzenberg after the rights were bought by the studio in 1995.<br/>6. ""Shrek"" originally cast Chris Farley to do the voice for the title character, recording about 80%–90% of his dialog.<br/>7. After Farley died in 1997 before he could finish, Mike Myers was brought in to work for the character, who after his first recording decided to record his voice in a Scottish accent.<br/>8. The film was also originally planned to be motion-captured, but after poor results, the studio decided to get PDI to help ""Shrek"" get its final computer-animated look.Earning $484.4 million at the worldwide box office, the film was a critical and commercial success.<br/>9. ""Shrek"" also received promotion from food chains such as Baskin-Robbins (promoting the film's DVD release) and Burger King.<br/>10. It was acclaimed as an animated film worthy of adult interest, with many adult-oriented jokes and themes but a simple enough plot and humour to appeal to children.<br/>11. ""Shrek"" won the first ever Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.<br/>12. The film was also nominated for six British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards, including the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Eddie Murphy for his voice-over performance as Donkey, and won the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.<br/>13.

A fifth film, planned as the last of the series, was cancelled in 2009 with the announcement that the fourth film would conclude the series.<br/>17.

The story depicts several decades in the life of Forrest Gump, a naïve and slow-witted yet athletically prodigious native of Alabama who witnesses, and in some cases influences, some of the defining events of the latter half of the 20th century in the United States; more specifically, the period between Forrest's birth in 1944 and 1982.The film differs substantially from Winston Groom's novel on which it is based, including Gump's personality and several events that were depicted.<br/>4. Filming took place in late 1993, mainly in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.<br/>5. Extensive visual effects were used to incorporate the protagonist into archived footage and to develop other scenes.<br/>6. A comprehensive soundtrack was featured in the film, using music intended to pinpoint specific time periods portrayed on screen.<br/>7. Its commercial release made it a top-selling soundtrack, selling over 12 million copies worldwide.Released in the United States on July 6, 1994, ""Forrest Gump"" received critical acclaim and became a commercial success as the top grossing film in North America released that year, being the first major success for Paramount Pictures since the studio's sale to Viacom earlier in the year.<br/>8. The film earned over $677 million worldwide during its theatrical run.<br/>9. The film won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director for Robert Zemeckis, Best Actor for Tom Hanks, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Visual Effects and Best Film Editing.<br/>10. It also garnered multiple other awards and nominations, including Golden Globe Awards, People's Choice Awards and Young Artist Awards, among others.<br/>11. Since the film's release, varying interpretations have been made of the film's protagonist and its political symbolism.<br/>12. In 1996, a themed restaurant, Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, opened based on the film, and has since expanded to multiple locations worldwide.<br/>13. The scene of Gump running across the country is often referred to when real-life people attempt the feat.<br/>14. In 2011, the Library of Congress selected ""Forrest Gump"" for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".<br/>",2,Who directed Forest Gump?,,

In support of ""Das Boot"" on this subject, U-Boat historian Michael Gannon maintains that the U-boat navy was one of the least pro-Nazi branches of the German armed forces.Even though the beginning and the end of the film occur in the port of La Rochelle, it does not correspond historically.<br/>6. The submarine base in La Rochelle was not functional before November 1941, and at the time of the film the port was dried up.<br/>7. Moreover, none of the British fighter-bombers of late 1941 to early 1942 had the range to bomb La Rochelle from bases in the U.K.; however, it is possible the fighters were carrier-based and not land based.<br/>8. While Saint-Nazaire was the base used in the novel, the film was changed to La Rochelle because its appearance had not changed to such a large degree in the years since World War II.In real life, the ""U-96"" was based at Saint-Nazaire in late 1941.<br/>9.

Following the scale model creation, a crew of over 30 people, including Crowley and engineers Chris Culvert and Annie Smith, carved a full-size replica of the Tumbler out of a large block of Styrofoam in two months.The Styrofoam model was used to create a steel ""test frame"", which had to stand up to several standards: have a speed of over , go from 0 to in 5 seconds, possess a steering system to make sharp turns at city corners, and withstand a self-propelled launch of up to .<br/>5.

The design and development process took nine months and cost several million dollars.With the design process complete, four street-ready race cars were constructed, with each vehicle possessing 65 panels and costing $250,000 to build.<br/>8. Two of the four cars were specialized versions.<br/>9.

The other version was the jet version, in which an actual jet engine was mounted onto the vehicle, fueled by six propane tanks.<br/>11. The visibility inside the vehicle was poor, so monitors were connected to cameras on the vehicle body.<br/>12. The professional drivers for the Tumblers practiced driving the vehicles for six months before they drove on the streets of Chicago for the film's scenes.The interior of the Tumbler was an immobile studio set and not actually the interior of a street-capable Tumbler.<br/>13.

Although an air-cooled design was chosen for the reactor at Oak Ridge to facilitate rapid construction, it was recognized that this would be impractical for the much larger production reactors.<br/>2. Initial designs by the Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont used helium for cooling, before they determined that a water-cooled reactor would be simpler, cheaper and quicker to build.<br/>3. The design did not become available until 4 October 1943; in the meantime, Matthias concentrated on improving the Hanford site by erecting accommodations, improving the roads, building a railway switch line, and upgrading the electricity, water and telephone lines.As at Oak Ridge, the most difficulty was encountered while canning the uranium slugs, which commenced at Hanford in March 1944.<br/>4. They were pickled to remove dirt and impurities, dipped in molten bronze, tin, and aluminum-silicon alloy, canned using hydraulic presses, and then capped using arc welding under an argon atmosphere.<br/>5. Finally, they were subjected to a series of tests to detect holes or faulty welds.<br/>6. Disappointingly, most canned slugs initially failed the tests, resulting in an output of only a handful of canned slugs per day.<br/>7. But steady progress was made and by June 1944 production increased to the point where it appeared that enough canned slugs would be available to start Reactor B on schedule in August 1944.Work began on Reactor B, the first of six planned 250 MW reactors, on 10 October 1943.<br/>8. <strike>The reactor complexes were given letter designations A through F, with B, D and F sites chosen to be developed first, as this maximised the distance between the reactors.</strike><br/>9. <strike>They would be the only ones constructed during the Manhattan Project.</strike><br/>10. Some of steel, of concrete, 50,000 concrete blocks and 71,000 concrete bricks were used to construct the high building.Construction of the reactor itself commenced in February 1944.<br/>11. Watched by Compton, Matthias, DuPont's Crawford Greenewalt, Leona Woods and Fermi, who inserted the first slug, the reactor was powered up beginning on 13 September 1944.<br/>12. Over the next few days, 838 tubes were loaded and the reactor went critical.<br/>13. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the control rods to initiate production.<br/>14. At first all appeared well but around 03:00 the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely.<br/>15. The cooling water was investigated to see if there was a leak or contamination.<br/>16. The next day the reactor started up again, only to shut down once more.Fermi contacted Chien-Shiung Wu, who identified the cause of the problem as neutron poisoning from xenon-135, which has a half-life of 9.2 hours.<br/>17. Fermi, Woods, Donald J. Hughes and John Archibald Wheeler then calculated the nuclear cross section of xenon-135, which turned out to be 30,000 times that of uranium.<br/>18. Fortunately, DuPont engineer George Graves had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added an additional 504 tubes to fill in the corners.<br/>19. The scientists had originally considered this overengineering a waste of time and money, but Fermi realized that by loading all 2,004 tubes, the reactor could reach the required power level and efficiently produce plutonium.<br/>20.

Reformation outside Germany.Switzerland.Zwingli.Parallel to events in Germany, a movement began in the Swiss Confederation under the leadership of Huldrych Zwingli.<br/>2. Zwingli was a scholar and preacher who moved to Zurich – the then-leading city state – in 1518, a year after Martin Luther began the Reformation in Germany with his 95 Theses.<br/>3. Although the two movements agreed on many issues of theology, as the recently introduced printing press spread ideas rapidly from place to place, some unresolved differences kept them separate.<br/>4. A long-standing resentment between the German states and the Swiss Confederation led to heated debate over how much Zwingli owed his ideas to Lutheranism.<br/>5. Although Zwinglianism does hold uncanny resemblance to Lutheranism (it even had its own equivalent of the 95 Theses, called the 67 Conclusions), historians have been unable to prove that Zwingli had any contact with Luther's publications before 1520, and Zwingli himself maintained that he had prevented himself from reading them.<br/>6. The German Prince Philip of Hesse saw potential in creating an alliance between Zwingli and Luther, seeing strength in a united Protestant front.<br/>7. A meeting was held in his castle in 1529, now known as the Colloquy of Marburg, which has become infamous for its complete failure.<br/>8. <strike>The two men could not come to any agreement due to their disputation over one key doctrine.</strike><br/>9. <strike>Although Luther preached consubstantiation in the Eucharist over transubstantiation, he believed in the spiritual presence of Christ at the mass.</strike><br/>10. <strike>Zwingli believed that the mass was only representative and memorial – Christ was not present.</strike><br/>11. Luther became so angry that he famously carved into the meeting table 'Hoc Est Corpus Meum' – a Biblical quotation from the Last Supper meaning 'this is my body'.<br/>12. Some followers of Zwingli believed that the Reformation was too conservative, and moved independently toward more radical positions, some of which survive among modern day Anabaptists.<br/>13. One famous incident illustrating this was when radical Zwinglians fried and ate sausages during Lent in Zurich city square by way of protest against the Church teaching of good works.<br/>14.

A major, problematic negotiation point was prisoner of war (POW) repatriation.<br/>3. The PVA, KPA, and UN Command could not agree on a system of repatriation because many PVA and KPA soldiers refused to be repatriated back to the north, which was unacceptable to the Chinese and North Koreans.<br/>4.

Starting in the early 1930s, during the last stages of the Weimar Republic, German aerospace engineers experimented with liquid-fueled rockets, with the goal that one day they would be capable of reaching high altitudes and traversing long distances.<br/>3. The head of the German Army's Ballistics and Munitions Branch, Lieutenant Colonel Karl Emil Becker, gathered a small team of engineers that included Walter Dornberger and Leo Zanssen, to figure out how to use rockets as long-range artillery in order to get around the Treaty of Versailles' ban on research and development of long-range cannons.<br/>4. Wernher von Braun, a young engineering prodigy, was recruited by Becker and Dornberger to join their secret army program at Kummersdorf-West in 1932.<br/>5. Von Braun had dreams about conquering outer space with rockets, and did not initially see the military value in missile technology.During the Second World War, General Dornberger was the military head of the army's rocket program, Zanssen became the commandant of the Peenemünde army rocket centre, and von Braun was the technical director of the ballistic missile program.<br/>6. They would lead the team that built the Aggregate-4 (A-4) rocket, which became the first vehicle to reach outer space during its test flight program in 1942 and 1943.<br/>7. By 1943, Germany began mass-producing the A-4 as the Vergeltungswaffe 2 (""Vengeance Weapon"" 2, or more commonly, V2), a ballistic missile with a range carrying a warhead at .<br/>8.

Each of the Allies captured a share of the available members of the German rocket team, but the United States benefited the most with Operation Paperclip, recruiting von Braun and most of his engineering team, who later helped develop the American missile and space exploration programs.<br/>12.

Their size is determined by a mass balance between snow input and melt output.<br/>3. As temperatures warm, glaciers retreat unless snow precipitation increases to make up for the additional melt; the converse is also true.Glaciers grow and shrink due both to natural variability and external forcings.<br/>4. Variability in temperature, precipitation, and englacial and subglacial hydrology can strongly determine the evolution of a glacier in a particular season.<br/>5. Therefore, one must average over a decadal or longer time-scale and/or over a many individual glaciers to smooth out the local short-term variability and obtain a glacier history that is related to climate.A world glacier inventory has been compiled since the 1970s, initially based mainly on aerial photographs and maps but now relying more on satellites.<br/>6. This compilation tracks more than 100,000 glaciers covering a total area of approximately 240,000 km2, and preliminary estimates indicate that the remaining ice cover is around 445,000 km2.<br/>7. The World Glacier Monitoring Service collects data annually on glacier retreat and glacier mass balance.<br/>8. From this data, glaciers worldwide have been found to be shrinking significantly, with strong glacier retreats in the 1940s, stable or growing conditions during the 1920s and 1970s, and again retreating from the mid-1980s to present.The most significant climate processes since the middle to late Pliocene (approximately 3 million years ago) are the glacial and interglacial cycles.<br/>9. The present interglacial period (the Holocene) has lasted about 11,700 years.<br/>10. Shaped by orbital variations, responses such as the rise and fall of continental ice sheets and significant sea-level changes helped create the climate.<br/>11. Other changes, including Heinrich events, Dansgaard–Oeschger events and the Younger Dryas, however, illustrate how glacial variations may also influence climate without the orbital forcing.Glaciers leave behind moraines that contain a wealth of material—including organic matter, quartz, and potassium that may be dated—recording the periods in which a glacier advanced and retreated.<br/>12. Similarly, by tephrochronological techniques, the lack of glacier cover can be identified by the presence of soil or volcanic tephra horizons whose date of deposit may also be ascertained.<br/>",9,How long has the Holocene lasted?,,

It usually differs from engineering in that an applied physicist may not be designing something in particular, but rather is using physics or conducting physics research with the aim of developing new technologies or solving a problem.The approach is similar to that of applied mathematics.<br/>4. Applied physicists can also be interested in the use of physics for scientific research.<br/>5. For instance, people working on accelerator physics might seek to build better particle detectors for research in theoretical physics.Physics is used heavily in engineering.<br/>6. For example, statics, a subfield of mechanics, is used in the building of bridges and other static structures.<br/>7. The understanding and use of acoustics results in sound control and better concert halls; similarly, the use of optics creates better optical devices.<br/>8. An understanding of physics makes for more realistic flight simulators, video games, and movies, and is often critical in forensic investigations.With the standard consensus that the laws of physics are universal and do not change with time, physics can be used to study things that would ordinarily be mired in uncertainty.<br/>9. For example, in the study of the origin of the earth, one can reasonably model earth's mass, temperature, and rate of rotation, as a function of time allowing one to extrapolate forward and backward in time and so predict prior and future conditions.<br/>10.

Concepts and models used in evolutionary biology, such as natural selection, have many applications.Artificial selection is the intentional selection of traits in a population of organisms.<br/>2. This has been used for thousands of years in the domestication of plants and animals.<br/>3. More recently, such selection has become a vital part of genetic engineering, with selectable markers such as antibiotic resistance genes being used to manipulate DNA.<br/>4. Proteins with valuable properties have evolved by repeated rounds of mutation and selection (for example modified enzymes and new antibodies) in a process called directed evolution.Understanding the changes that have occurred during organism's evolution can reveal the genes needed to construct parts of the body, genes which may be involved in human genetic disorders.<br/>5. <strike>For example, the mexican tetra is an albino cavefish that lost its eyesight during evolution.</strike><br/>6. Breeding together different populations of this blind fish produced some offspring with functional eyes, since different mutations had occurred in the isolated populations that had evolved in different caves.<br/>7. This helped identify genes required for vision and pigmentation.Many human diseases are not static phenomena, but capable of evolution.<br/>8. Viruses, bacteria, fungi and cancers evolve to be resistant to host immune defences, as well as pharmaceutical drugs.<br/>9. These same problems occur in agriculture with pesticide and herbicide resistance.<br/>10. It is possible that we are facing the end of the effective life of most of available antibiotics and predicting the evolution and evolvability of our pathogens and devising strategies to slow or circumvent it is requiring deeper knowledge of the complex forces driving evolution at the molecular level.In computer science, simulations of evolution using evolutionary algorithms and artificial life started in the 1960s and was extended with simulation of artificial selection.<br/>11. Artificial evolution became a widely recognised optimisation method as a result of the work of Ingo Rechenberg in the 1960s.<br/>12. He used evolution strategies to solve complex engineering problems.<br/>13. Genetic algorithms in particular became popular through the writing of John Holland.<br/>14. Practical applications also include automatic evolution of computer programmes.<br/>15. Evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multi-dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers and also to optimise the design of systems.<br/>",1,Is natural selection a concept of evolutionary biology?,,

These arise from electric currents along field lines (""field aligned currents""), generated by a dynamo mechanism due to the relative motion between the rotating planet and the moving moon.<br/>7. Io, which has active volcanism and an ionosphere, is a particularly strong source, and its currents also generate radio emissions, studied since 1955.<br/>8.

By analyzing a map of crustal magnetic anomalies compiled with data from Mars Global Surveyor, scientists observed that the region of the emissions corresponded to an area where the strongest magnetic field is localized.<br/>16.

Popping results are sensitive to the rate at which the kernels are heated.<br/>2. If heated too quickly, the steam in the outer layers of the kernel can reach high pressures and rupture the hull before the starch in the center of the kernel can fully gelatinize, leading to partially popped kernels with hard centers.<br/>3. Heating too slowly leads to entirely unpopped kernels: the tip of the kernel, where it attached to the cob, is not entirely moisture-proof, and when heated slowly, the steam can leak out of the tip fast enough to keep the pressure from rising sufficiently to break the hull and cause the pop.Producers and sellers of popcorn consider two major factors in evaluating the quality of popcorn: what percentage of the kernels will pop, and how much each popped kernel expands.<br/>4. Expansion is an important factor to both the consumer and vendor.<br/>5. For the consumer, larger pieces of popcorn tend to be more tender and are associated with higher quality.<br/>6. For the grower, distributor, and vendor, expansion is closely correlated with profit: vendors such as theaters buy popcorn by weight and sell it by volume.<br/>7. For both these reasons, higher-expansion popcorn fetches a higher profit per unit weight.Popcorn will pop when freshly harvested, but not well: its high moisture content leads to poor expansion and chewy pieces of popcorn.<br/>8. Kernels with a high moisture content are also susceptible to mold when stored.<br/>9. For these reasons, popcorn growers and distributors dry the kernels until they reach the moisture level at which they expand the most.<br/>10. This differs by variety and conditions, but is generally in the range of 14–15% moisture by weight.<br/>11. If the kernels are over-dried, the expansion rate will suffer and the percentage of kernels that pop at all will decline.When the popcorn has finished popping, sometimes unpopped kernels remain.<br/>12. Known in the popcorn industry as ""old maids"", the kernels don't pop because they do not have enough moisture to create enough steam for an explosion.<br/>13. Rehydrating prior to popping usually results in eliminating the unpopped kernels.Popcorn varieties are broadly categorized by the shape of the kernels, the color of the kernels, or the shape of the popped corn.<br/>14. While the kernels may come in a variety of colors, the popped corn is always off-yellow or white as it is only the hull (or pericarp) that is colored.<br/>15. <strike>""Rice"" type popcorns have a long kernel pointed at both ends; ""pearl"" type kernels are rounded at the top.</strike><br/>16.
