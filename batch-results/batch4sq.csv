The Beatles started recording ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" at EMI Studios in Studio 2 on 17 October 1963.<br/>2. This song, along with the single's flip side, ""This Boy"", was the first Beatles song to be recorded with four-track technology.<br/>3. The two songs were recorded on the same day, and each needed seventeen takes to complete.<br/>4. Also, the Beatles were experimenting with organ-sounding guitars, which was achieved by extreme compression on John Lennon's rhythm guitar.Mono and stereo mixing was done by George Martin on 21 October 1963; further stereo mixes were done on 8 June 1965, for compilations released by EMI affiliates in Australia and the Netherlands, and on 7 November 1966.<br/>5. ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" was one of two Beatles songs (along with ""She Loves You"" as """"Sie liebt dich"""") to be later recorded in German, entitled ""Komm, gib mir deine Hand"".<br/>6. Both songs were translated by Luxembourger musician Camillo Felgen, under the pseudonym of ""Jean Nicolas"".Odeon, the German arm of EMI (the parent company of the Beatles' record label, Parlophone) was convinced that the Beatles' records would not sell in Germany unless they were sung in German.<br/>7. The Beatles detested the idea, and when they were due to record the German version on 27 January 1964 at EMI's Pathe Marconi Studios in Paris (where the Beatles were performing 18 days of concerts at the Olympia Theatre) they chose to boycott the session.<br/>8. <strike>Their record producer, George Martin, having waited some hours for them to show up, was outraged and insisted that they give it a try.</strike><br/>9.

However, Martin later conceded: ""They were right, actually, it wasn’t necessary for them to record in German, but they weren’t graceless, they did a good job"".<br/>11. ""Komm, gib mir deine Hand"" appeared in full stereo in the United States on the Capitol LP ""Something New"" and years later on the Capitol CD compilation called ""The Capitol Albums, Volume 1"".The German-language track was a big hit in Germany at the time, but today, like all the other German-lyrics versions of English-language pop songs that were popular in that country during the 1950s and 1960s, it is generally considered as a cultural curiosity from a by-gone era at best.<br/>12.

For example, one of the firm's recurring clients is a fictional internet search company known as Chumhum, which among other issues has faced privacy lawsuits for selling users' personal data to the Chinese and Syrian government.<br/>5. ""The Good Wife"" was the first TV show to feature Bitcoin, the virtual internet currency, with an episode featuring Bitcoin first broadcast in January 2012.<br/>6. This led to it achieving a high level of fame amongst the Bitcoin community.In the season 5 premiere, a Double Robotics robot was featured on the show which allowed a litigator to teleconference from home by controlling a tablet on wheels.<br/>7. However, rather than glorifying the robot's features, ""The Good Wife"" turned it into a punchline with practical jokes and problems the robot could have such as it not being able to maneuver around an office and bumping into walls, doors and people and low Wi-Fi connectivity leading to buffering and loss of visual and voice communication of the person working at home.In Episode 9 ""Whack-a-Mole"" ""The Good Wife"" featured a version of Reddit called ""Scabbit"" and how it affects the law and the downsides of having an ""average joe"" being an investigator trying to find a domestic terrorist.<br/>8. It also deals with injunctions of taking down a defamatory web page on ""Scabbit"" but having another similar web page pop up soon after.In Episode 11 ""Goliath and David"" the story is based around a TV Show 'Drama Camp' who stole an Indie band's cover of a rap song and deals with the legality of copyright infringement.<br/>9. It was inspired by Jonathan Coulton who created a cover of 'Baby Got Back' and Glee, the TV series, which used an identical cover on the show.<br/>10.

The features that became Niagara Falls were created by the Wisconsin glaciation about 10,000 years ago.<br/>2. The same forces also created the North American Great Lakes and the Niagara River.<br/>3. All were dug by a continental ice sheet that drove through the area, deepening some river channels to form lakes, and damming others with debris.<br/>4. Scientists argue that there is an old valley, buried by glacial drift, at the approximate location of the present Welland Canal.When the ice melted, the upper Great Lakes emptied into the Niagara river, which followed the rearranged topography across the Niagara Escarpment.<br/>5. In time, the river cut a gorge through the north facing cliff, or cuesta.<br/>6. Because of the interactions of three major rock formations, the rocky bed did not erode evenly.<br/>7. The top rock formation was composed of erosion-resistant limestone and Lockport dolostone.<br/>8. That hard layer of stone eroded more slowly than the underlying materials.<br/>9. The aerial photo on the right clearly shows the hard caprock, the Lockport Formation (Middle Silurian), which underlies the rapids above the falls, and approximately the upper third of the high gorge wall.Immediately below the hard-rock formation, comprising about two thirds of the cliff, lay the weaker, softer, sloping Rochester Formation (Lower Silurian).<br/>10. This formation was composed mainly of shale, though it has some thin limestone layers.<br/>11. It also contains ancient fossils.<br/>12. In time, the river eroded the soft layer that supported the hard layers, undercutting the hard caprock, which gave way in great chunks.<br/>13. This process repeated countless times, eventually carving out the falls.Submerged in the river in the lower valley, hidden from view, is the Queenston Formation (Upper Ordovician), which is composed of shales and fine sandstones.<br/>14. <strike>All three formations were laid down in an ancient sea, their differences of character deriving from changing conditions within that sea.About 10,900 years ago, the Niagara Falls was located between present-day Queenston, Ontario, and Lewiston, New York, but erosion of their crest has caused the waterfalls to retreat approximately southward.</strike><br/>15. The Horseshoe Falls, which are approximately wide, have also changed their shape through the process of erosion; evolving from a small arch, to a horseshoe bend, to the present day gigantic inverted V. Just upstream from the falls' current location, Goat Island splits the course of the Niagara River, resulting in the separation of the Canadian Horseshoe Falls to the west from the American and Bridal Veil Falls to the east.<br/>16.

The Great Wall concept was revived again during the Ming Dynasty in the 14th century, and following the Ming army's defeat by the Oirats in the Battle of Tumu.<br/>2. The Ming had failed to gain a clear upper hand over the Manchurian and Mongolian tribes after successive battles, and the long-drawn conflict was taking a toll on the empire.<br/>3. The Ming adopted a new strategy to keep the nomadic tribes out by constructing walls along the northern border of China.<br/>4. Acknowledging the Mongol control established in the Ordos Desert, the wall followed the desert's southern edge instead of incorporating the bend of the Yellow River.Unlike the earlier fortifications, the Ming construction was stronger and more elaborate due to the use of bricks and stone instead of rammed earth.<br/>5. Up to 25,000 watchtowers are estimated to have been constructed on the wall.<br/>6. As Mongol raids continued periodically over the years, the Ming devoted considerable resources to repair and reinforce the walls.<br/>7. Sections near the Ming capital of Beijing were especially strong.<br/>8. Qi Jiguang between 1567 and 1570 also repaired and reinforced the wall, faced sections of the ram-earth wall with bricks and constructed 1,200 watchtowers from Shanhaiguan Pass to Changping to warn of approaching Mongol raiders.<br/>9. During the 1440s–1460s, the Ming also built a so-called ""Liaodong Wall"".<br/>10. Similar in function to the Great Wall (whose extension, in a sense, it was), but more basic in construction, the Liaodong Wall enclosed the agricultural heartland of the Liaodong province, protecting it against potential incursions by Jurched-Mongol Oriyanghan from the northwest and the Jianzhou Jurchens from the north.<br/>11. While stones and tiles were used in some parts of the Liaodong Wall, most of it was in fact simply an earth dike with moats on both sides.Towards the end of the Ming Dynasty, the Great Wall helped defend the empire against the Manchu invasions that began around 1600.<br/>12. Even after the loss of all of Liaodong, the Ming army held the heavily fortified Shanhaiguan pass, preventing the Manchus from conquering the Chinese heartland.<br/>13. <strike>The Manchus were finally able to cross the Great Wall in 1644, after Beijing had already fallen to Li Zicheng's rebels.</strike><br/>14. Before this time, the Manchus had crossed the Great Wall multiple times to raid, but this time it was for conquest.<br/>15. The gates at Shanhaiguan were opened by the commanding Ming general Wu Sangui on May 25 who formed an alliance with the Manchus, hoping to use the Manchus to expel the rebels from Beijing.<br/>16. The Manchus quickly seized Beijing, and defeated both the rebel-founded Shun Dynasty and the remaining Ming resistance, establishing the Qing Dynasty rule over all of China.Under Qing rule, China's borders extended beyond the walls and Mongolia was annexed into the empire, so constructions on the Great Wall were discontinued.<br/>17. On the other hand, the so-called Willow Palisade, following a line similar to that of the Ming Liaodong Wall, was constructed by the Qing rulers in Manchuria.<br/>18. Its purpose, however, was not defense but rather migration control.<br/>",1,When was the great wall concept revived,,

Iron-using Khoisan hunter-gatherers displaced these Stone Age people and in turn were displaced by Bantu tribes such as the southern Tonga people known as the Batoka/Tokalea, who called the falls ""Shungu na mutitima"".<br/>3. The Matabele, later arrivals, named them ""aManz' aThunqayo"", and the Batswana and Makololo (whose language is used by the Lozi people) call them ""Mosi-o-Tunya"".<br/>4. All these names mean essentially ""the smoke that thunders"".A map from c.1750 drawn by Jacques Nicolas Bellin for Abbé Antoine François Prevost d'Exiles marks the falls as ""cataractes"" and notes a settlement to the north of the Zambezi as being friendly with the Portuguese at the time.<br/>5.

The falls were well known to local tribes, and Voortrekker hunters may have known of them, as may the Arabs under a name equivalent to ""the end of the world"".<br/>8. Europeans were sceptical of their reports, perhaps thinking that the lack of mountains and valleys on the plateau made a large falls unlikely.Livingstone had been told about the falls before he reached them from upriver and was paddled across to a small island that now bears the name Livingstone Island in Zambia.<br/>9. Livingstone had previously been impressed by the Ngonye Falls further upstream, but found the new falls much more impressive, and gave them their English name in honour of Queen Victoria.<br/>10. He wrote of the falls, ""No one can imagine the beauty of the view from anything witnessed in England.<br/>11. It had never been seen before by European eyes; but scenes so lovely must have been gazed upon by angels in their flight.<br/>12. ""In 1860, Livingstone returned to the area and made a detailed study of the falls with John Kirk.<br/>13. Other early European visitors included Portuguese explorer Serpa Pinto, Czech explorer Emil Holub, who made the first detailed plan of the falls and its surroundings in 1875 (published in 1880), and British artist Thomas Baines, who executed some of the earliest paintings of the falls.<br/>14.

The Paiute and Sierra Miwok peoples lived in the area long before the first explorations by American settlers into the region.<br/>3. A band of Paiute called the ""Ahwahneechee"" were living in the Yosemite Valley when the first known group of European Americans entered it.The California Gold Rush in the mid-19th century dramatically increased travel by European-Americans in the area, causing competition for resources between the regional Paiute and Miwok and the miners and hangers on.<br/>4. In 1851 as part of the Mariposa Wars intended to suppress Native American resistance, United States Army Major Jim Savage led the Mariposa Battalion into the west end of Yosemite Valley.<br/>5. He was pursuing forces of around 200 Ahwahneechee led by Chief Tenaya.Accounts from this battalion were the first well-documented reports of ethnic Europeans entering Yosemite Valley.<br/>6. Attached to Savage's unit was Dr. Lafayette Bunnell, the company physician, who later wrote about his awestruck impressions of the valley in ""The Discovery of the Yosemite"".<br/>7. Bunnell is credited with naming Yosemite Valley, based on his interviews with Chief Tenaya.<br/>8. Bunnell wrote that Chief Tenaya was the founder of the Pai-Ute Colony of Ah-wah-nee.<br/>9. The Miwok, a neighboring tribe, and most white settlers considered the Ahwahneechee to be especially violent because of their frequent territorial disputes.<br/>10.

Special boxes were provided at the north and south ends respectively for the Emperor and the Vestal Virgins, providing the best views of the arena.<br/>4.

Vincent Willem van Gogh (; 30 March 185329 July 1890) was a post-Impressionist painter of Dutch origin whose work, notable for its rough beauty, emotional honesty and bold color, had a far-reaching influence on 20th-century art.<br/>2. <strike>After years of painful anxiety and frequent bouts of mental illness, he died aged 37 from a gunshot wound, generally accepted to be self-inflicted (although no gun was ever found).</strike><br/>3. His work was then known to only a handful of people and appreciated by fewer still.Van Gogh began to draw as a child, and he continued to draw throughout the years that led up to his decision to become an artist.<br/>4. He did not begin painting until his late twenties, completing many of his best-known works during the last two years of his life.<br/>5. In just over a decade, he produced more than 2,100 artworks, consisting of 860 oil paintings and more than 1,300 watercolors, drawings, sketches and prints.<br/>6. His work included self portraits, landscapes, still lifes, portraits and paintings of cypresses, wheat fields and sunflowers.Van Gogh spent his early adulthood working for a firm of art dealers, traveling between The Hague, London and Paris, after which he taught for a time in England at Isleworth and Ramsgate.<br/>7. One of his early aspirations was to become a pastor and from 1879 he worked as a missionary in a mining region in Belgium where he began to sketch people from the local community.<br/>8. In 1885, he painted his first major work ""The Potato Eaters"".<br/>9. His palette at the time consisted mainly of somber earth tones and showed no sign of the vivid coloration that distinguished his later work.<br/>10. In March 1886, he moved to Paris and discovered the French Impressionists.<br/>11. Later, he moved to the south of France and was influenced by the strong sunlight he found there.<br/>12. His work grew brighter in color, and he developed the unique and highly recognizable style that became fully realized during his stay in Arles in 1888.The extent to which his mental health affected his painting has been a subject of speculation since his death.<br/>13. Despite a widespread tendency to romanticize his ill health, modern critics see an artist deeply frustrated by the inactivity and incoherence brought about by his bouts of illness.<br/>14. According to art critic Robert Hughes, Van Gogh's late works show an artist at the height of his ability, completely in control and ""longing for concision and grace.""<br/>",1,When was Vincent van Gogh born?,,

In August 1930, Grant Wood, an American painter with European training, was driven around Eldon, Iowa by a young painter from Eldon, John Sharp, looking for inspiration.<br/>2. Wood noticed the Dibble House, a small white house built in the Carpenter Gothic architectural style.<br/>3. Sharp's brother suggested in 1973 that it was on this drive that Wood first sketched the house on the back of an envelope.<br/>4. Wood's earliest biographer, Darrell Garwood, noted that Wood ""thought it a form of borrowed pretentiousness, a structural absurdity, to put a Gothic-style window in such a flimsy frame house.""<br/>5. At the time, Wood classified it as one of the ""cardboardy frame houses on Iowa farms"" and considered it ""very paintable"".<br/>6.

Their older brother Michael Stein and his wife Sarah also became collectors of his work.<br/>8. Picasso painted portraits of both Gertrude Stein and her nephew Allan Stein.<br/>9. Gertrude Stein became Picasso's principal patron, acquiring his drawings and paintings and exhibiting them in her informal ""Salon"" at her home in Paris.<br/>10.

Michelangelo's relief of the ""Battle of the Centaurs"", created while he was still a youth associated with the Medici Academy, is an unusually complex relief in that it shows a great number of figures involved in a vigorous struggle.<br/>2. Such a complex disarray of figures was rare in Florentine art, where it would usually only be found in images showing either the Massacre of the Innocents or the Torments of Hell.<br/>3. The relief treatment, in which some of the figures are boldly projecting, may indicate Michelangelo's familiarity with Roman sarcophagus reliefs from the collection of Lorenzo Medici, and similar marble panels created by Nicola and Giovanni Pisano, and with the figurative compositions on Ghiberti's Baptistry Doors.The composition of the ""Battle of Cascina"", is known in its entirety only from copies, as the original cartoon, according to Vasari, was so admired that it deteriorated and was eventually in pieces.<br/>4. It reflects the earlier relief in the energy and diversity of the figures, with many different postures, and many being viewed from the back, as they turn toward the approaching enemy and prepare for battle.In ""The Last Judgement"" it is said that Michelangelo drew inspiration from a fresco by Melozzo da Forli in the Church of the Holy Apostles, Rome.<br/>5. While the work is very different in character to Michelangelo's, Melozzo had depicting figures from different angles, as if they were floating in the Heaven and seen from below.<br/>6. Melozzo's majestic figure of Christ, with windblown cloak, demonstrates a degree of foreshortening of the figure that had also been employed by Andrea Mantegna, but was not usual in the frescos of Florentine painters.<br/>7. In ""The Last Judgement"" Michelangelo had the opportunity to depict, on an unprecedented scale, figures in the action of either rising heavenward or falling and being dragged down.In the two frescos of the Pauline Chapel, the ""Crucifixion of Peter"" and the ""Conversion of Paul"", Michelangelo has used the various groups of figures to convey a complex narrative.<br/>8. <strike>In the ""Crucifixion of Peter"" soldiers busy themselves about their assigned duty of digging a post hole and raising the cross while various people look on and discuss the events.</strike><br/>9.

He studied the mechanical functions of the skeleton and the muscular forces that are applied to it in a manner that prefigured the modern science of biomechanics.<br/>9. He drew the heart and vascular system, the sex organs and other internal organs, making one of the first scientific drawings of a fetus ""in utero"".<br/>10. The drawings and notation are far ahead of their time, and if published, would undoubtedly have made a major contribution to medical science.As an artist, Leonardo also closely observed and recorded the effects of age and of human emotion on the physiology, studying in particular the effects of rage.<br/>11. He also drew many figures who had significant facial deformities or signs of illness.<br/>12. Leonardo also studied and drew the anatomy of many animals, dissecting cows, birds, monkeys, bears, and frogs, and comparing in his drawings their anatomical structure with that of humans.<br/>13.

""The Metamorphosis of Narcissus"" also symbolized death and petrification.Various other animals appear throughout his work as well: ants point to death, decay, and immense sexual desire; the snail is connected to the human head (he saw a snail on a bicycle outside Freud's house when he first met Sigmund Freud); and locusts are a symbol of waste and fear.<br/>",4,"When was Salvador Dali's work ""Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee Around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening"" produced?",,

In clock-limited sports, games often end with a team that holds the lead killing the clock rather than competing aggressively against the opposing team.<br/>2. In contrast, baseball has no clock; a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time.<br/>3. At almost any turn in any baseball game, the most advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy.<br/>4. In contrast, again, the clock comes into play even in the case of multi-day Test and first-class cricket: the possibility of a draw often encourages a team that is batting last and well behind to bat defensively, giving up any faint chance at a win to avoid a loss.<br/>5. Baseball offers no such reward for conservative batting.While nine innings has been the standard since the beginning of professional baseball, the duration of the average major league game has increased steadily through the years.<br/>6. At the turn of the 20th century, games typically took an hour and a half to play.<br/>7. In the 1920s, they averaged just less than two hours, which eventually ballooned to 2:38 in 1960.<br/>8. <strike>By 1997, the average American League game lasted 2:57 (National League games were about 10 minutes shorter—pitchers at the plate making for quicker outs than designated hitters).</strike><br/>9. In 2004, Major League Baseball declared that its goal was an average game of merely 2:45.<br/>10. The lengthening of games is attributed to longer breaks between half-innings for television commercials, increased offense, more pitching changes, and a slower pace of play with pitchers taking more time between each delivery, and batters stepping out of the box more frequently.<br/>11. Other leagues have experienced similar issues.<br/>12. In 2008, Nippon Professional Baseball took steps aimed at shortening games by 12 minutes from the preceding decade's average of 3:18.<br/>",12,When did the NPB shorten games?,,

Counter punchers are slippery, defensive style fighters who often rely on their opponent's mistakes in order to gain the advantage, whether it be on the score cards or more preferably a knockout.<br/>2. They use their well-rounded defense to avoid or block shots and then immediately catch the opponent off guard with a well placed and timed punch.<br/>3.

Taekwondo or (Korean 태권도 (hangul) / 跆拳道 (hanja), ) is a Korean martial art.<br/>2. It combines combat and self-defense techniques with sport and exercise.<br/>3. ""Gyeorugi"" (), a type of sparring, has been an Olympic event since 2000.<br/>4. Taekwondo was developed by a variety of Korean masters during the 1940s as partial combination of taekkyeon, Okinawan karate, and other traditions.The name ""taekwondo"" was coined by Choi Hong Hi (of the Oh Do Kwan).<br/>5. The World Taekwondo Federation claims that taekwondo development was a collaborative effort by a council consisting of members from the nine original kwans, while the International Taekwon-Do Federation credits Choi Hong Hi solely.<br/>6. ""Traditional taekwondo"" typically refers to the martial art as it was established in the 1950s and 1960s in the South Korean military and in various civilian organizations, including schools and universities.<br/>7. In particular, the names and symbolism of the both the traditional patterns and the newer poomsae often refer to elements of Korean history, culture and religious philosophy.<br/>8. This symbolism is replicated in the Korean flag.<br/>9. ""Sport taekwondo"" was developed in the 1950s and may have a somewhat different focus, especially in terms of its emphasis on speed and competition (as in Olympic sparring).<br/>10. <strike>Sport taekwondo is in turn subdivided into two main styles.</strike><br/>11. One style is practiced by International Taekwon-Do adherents and was created in 1955 by Choi Hong Hi.<br/>12. The other style derives from Kukkiwon, the source of the sparring system ""sihap gyeorugi"".<br/>13. This style is now an event at the summer Olympic Games and is governed by the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF).<br/>14. Kukkiwon (World Taekwondo Headquarters) is the traditional center for WTF taekwondo and was founded in 1973 by Dr. Kim Un Yong.Although there are doctrinal and technical differences between sparring in the two main styles and among the various organizations, the art in general emphasizes kicks and punches thrown from a mobile stance.<br/>15. Taekwondo training generally includes a system of blocks, kicks, punches, and open-handed strikes and may also include various take-downs or sweeps, throws, and joint locks.<br/>16. Pressure points, known as ""jiapsul"", are used, as well as grabbing self-defense techniques borrowed from other martial arts such as Japanese judo, Korean hapkido, and Korean wrestling or ssireum.In Korean, ""tae"" (태, ) means ""to strike or break with the foot""; ""kwon"" (권, ) means ""to strike or break with the fist""; and ""do"" (도, ) means ""way of life"".<br/>17. Thus, ""taekwondo"" may be loosely translated as ""the way of the foot and the hand.""<br/>18. The name ""taekwondo"" is also written as ""taekwon-do"", ""tae kwon-do"", or ""tae kwon do"" by various organizations.<br/>",1,What country is Taekwondo baised out of?,,

This type of spin is almost exclusively employed in service, but it is also used from time to time in the lob at the professional level.<br/>2. Unlike any of the aforementioned techniques, corkspin (sometimes referred to as ""drill-spin"") features a unique situation in which the axis of spin is more or less parallel to the trajectory of the ball.<br/>3. This means that the Magnus effect will have little to no effect on the trajectory of a cork-spun ball.<br/>4. Upon bouncing, the ball will dart right or left, depending on the direction of the spin, making it very difficult to return.<br/>5. Although in theory this type of spin produces the most obnoxious effects, it is not as strategically practical as sidespin or backspin in terms of the limitations that it imposes upon the opponent during their return.<br/>6. Aside from the initial direction change when bouncing, provided that it does not exceed the reach of the opponent, a cork-spun ball is easily countered with topspin ""or"" backspin.<br/>7. Similar to a backspin stroke, the corkspin stroke has a lower maximum velocity, simply due to the contact angle of the racket when producing the stroke.<br/>8. <strike>To impart a spin on the ball which is parallel to its trajectory, the racket must be swung more or less perpendicular to the trajectory of the ball.</strike><br/>9.

The general essence of English law is that it is made by judges sitting in courts, applying their common sense and knowledge of legal precedent—""stare decisis""—to the facts before them.The court system is headed by the Senior Courts of England and Wales, consisting of the Court of Appeal, the High Court of Justice for civil cases, and the Crown Court for criminal cases.<br/>4. <strike>The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom is the highest court for criminal and civil cases in England and Wales.</strike><br/>5.

The prison population doubled over the same period, giving it the highest incarceration rate in Western Europe at 147 per 100,000.<br/>8.

The reformers were led by 71-year-old Nguyen Van Linh, who became the party's new general secretary.<br/>10. Linh and the reformers implemented a series of free-market reforms – known as """" (""Renovation"") – which carefully managed the transition from a planned economy to a ""socialist-oriented market economy"".Though the authority of the state remained unchallenged under ""Đổi Mới"", the government encouraged private ownership of farms and factories, economic deregulation and foreign investment, while maintaining control over strategic industries.<br/>11.

He also deleted a topless scene for Moon Bloodgood because, ""It was a soft moment between a man and a woman that was designed to echo the Kelly McGillis/Harrison Ford moment in ""Witness"" in the end, it felt more like a gratuitous moment of a girl taking her top off in an action picture, and I didn't want that to convolute the story or the characters.""<br/>7.

Executive producer Art Linson, who supported the film, recalled the response: ""So many incidences of ""Fight Club"" were alarming, no group of executives could narrow them down.""<br/>4. Nevertheless, ""Fight Club"" was originally slated to be released in July 1999 but was later changed to August 6, 1999.<br/>5. The studio further delayed the film's release, this time to autumn, citing a crowded summer schedule and a hurried post-production process.<br/>6.

In the film, the code that comprises the Matrix itself is frequently represented as downward-flowing green characters.<br/>2. This code utilizes a custom typeface designed by Simon Whiteley, which includes mirror images of half-width kana characters and Western Latin letters and numerals.<br/>3. The color green reflects the green tint commonly used on early monochrome computer monitors.<br/>4. Lynne Cartwright, the Visual Effects Supervisor at Animal Logic, supervised the creation of the film's opening title sequence, as well as the general look of the Matrix code throughout the film, in collaboration with Lindsey Fleay and Justen Marshall.<br/>5. <strike>The portrayal resembles the opening credits of the 1995 Japanese cyberpunk film, ""Ghost in the Shell"", which had a strong influence on the ""Matrix"" series (see below).</strike><br/>6. It was also used in the subsequent films, on the related website, and in the game """", and its drop-down effect is reflected in the design of some posters for the ""Matrix"" series.<br/>7. The code received the Runner-up Award in the 1999 Jesse Garson Award for In-film typography or opening credit sequence.<br/>8. ""The Matrix""s production designer, Owen Paterson, used methods to distinguish the ""real world"" and the Matrix in a pervasive way.<br/>9. The production design team generally placed a bias towards the Matrix code's distinctive green color in scenes set within the simulation, whereas there is an emphasis on the color blue during scenes set in the ""real world"".<br/>10. In addition, the Matrix scenes' sets were slightly more decayed, monolithic, and grid-like, to convey the cold, logical and artificial nature of that environment.<br/>11. For the ""real world"", the actors' hair was less styled, their clothing had more textile content, and the cinematographers used longer lenses to soften the backgrounds and emphasize the actors.The ""Nebuchadnezzar"" was designed to have a patched-up look, instead of clean, cold and sterile space ship interior sets as used on films like ""Star Trek"".<br/>12. The wires were made visible to show the ship's working internals, and each composition was carefully designed to convey the ship as ""a marriage between Man and Machine"".<br/>13. For the scene when Neo wakes up in the pod connected to the Matrix, the pod was constructed to look dirty, used, and sinister.<br/>14. During the testing of a breathing mechanism in the pod, the tester went into hypothermia in under eight minutes, so the pod had to be heated.Kym Barrett, costume designer, said that she defined the characters and their environment by their costume.<br/>15. For example, Reeves' office costume was designed for Thomas Anderson to look uncomfortable, disheveled, and out of place.<br/>16. Barrett sometimes used three types of fabric for each costume, and also had to consider acting practicality.<br/>17. The actors needed to perform martial art actions in their costume, hang upside-down without people seeing up their dress, or work the wires when strapped to the harnesses.<br/>18. For Trinity, Barrett experimented with how each fabric absorbs and reflects different types of light, and was eventually able to make Trinity's costume mercury-like and oil-slick to suit the character.<br/>19. For the Agents, their costume was designed to create a secret service, undercover look, resembling the film ""JFK"".The sunglasses, a staple to the film's aesthetics, were commissioned for the film to designer Richard Walker from sunglass maker Blinde Design.<br/>",1,How is the code that comprises the Matrix represented in the film?,,

""The film introduces a vehicle that has been compared with the Batplane, dubbed ""the Bat"".<br/>9.

In order to make the Bat ""fly"", it was variously supported by wires, suspended from cranes and helicopters, and mounted on a purpose-built vehicle with hydraulic controls to simulate movement.When designing the Batcave set, Crowley and fellow production designer Kevin Kavanaugh hit upon the idea of flooding the Batcave and having Batman's equipment, the Batsuit and a supercomputer rise from the water.<br/>13.

It stars Christian Bale as Batman along with Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman.<br/>3. The film reboots the ""Batman"" film series, telling the origin story of the character from Bruce Wayne's initial fear of bats, the death of his parents, his journey to become Batman, and his fight against Ra's al Ghul's plot to destroy Gotham City.<br/>4. It draws inspiration from classic comic book storylines such as ""The Man Who Falls"", ', and '.After a series of unsuccessful projects to resurrect Batman on screen following the 1997 critical failure of ""Batman & Robin"", Nolan and David S. Goyer began to work on the film in early 2003 and aimed for a darker and more realistic tone, with humanity and realism being the basis of the film.<br/>5. The goal was to get the audience to care for both Batman and Bruce Wayne.<br/>6. The film, which was primarily shot in Iceland and Chicago, relied on traditional stunts and miniatures – computer-generated imagery was used minimally.<br/>7.

The offensive's success was undermined by the reluctance of other generals to commit their forces to support the victory.<br/>3. Allied and Russian forces were revived only temporarily by Romania's entry into the war on 27 August.<br/>4. German forces came to the aid of embattled Austro-Hungarian units in Transylvania while a German-Bulgarian force attacked from the south, and Bucharest fell to the Central Powers on 6 December.<br/>5. Meanwhile, unrest grew in Russia, as the Tsar remained at the front.<br/>6. Empress Alexandra's increasingly incompetent rule drew protests and resulted in the murder of her favourite, Rasputin, at the end of 1916.In March 1917, demonstrations in Petrograd culminated in the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II and the appointment of a weak Provisional Government, which shared power with the Petrograd Soviet socialists.<br/>7. This arrangement led to confusion and chaos both at the front and at home.<br/>8. The army became increasingly ineffective.Discontent and the weaknesses of the Provisional Government led to a rise in the popularity of the Bolshevik Party, led by Vladimir Lenin, which demanded an immediate end to the war.<br/>9. The successful armed uprising by the Bolsheviks of November was followed in December by an armistice and negotiations with Germany.<br/>10. At first, the Bolsheviks refused the German terms, but when German troops began marching across the Ukraine unopposed, the new government acceded to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on 3 March 1918.<br/>11. The treaty ceded vast territories, including Finland, the Baltic provinces, parts of Poland and Ukraine to the Central Powers.<br/>12. Despite this enormous apparent German success, the manpower required for German occupation of former Russian territory may have contributed to the failure of the Spring Offensive and secured relatively little food or other materiel.With the adoption of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Entente no longer existed.<br/>13. The Allied powers led a small-scale invasion of Russia, partly to stop Germany from exploiting Russian resources and, to a lesser extent, to support the ""Whites"" (as opposed to the ""Reds"") in the Russian Civil War.<br/>14.

While the Allies' ability to out-produce the Axis is often attributed to the Allies having more access to natural resources, other factors, such as Germany and Japan's reluctance to employ women in the labour force, Allied strategic bombing, and Germany's late shift to a war economy contributed significantly.<br/>5.

Over a century after the assassination, Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan both wrote letters to Richard Mudd agreeing that his grandfather committed no crime.<br/>4. However, others, including authors Edward Steers, Jr. and James Swanson, assert that Samuel Mudd visited Booth three times in the months before the failed kidnapping attempt.<br/>5.

A dispute immediately arose between Spain and the United States regarding the extent of Louisiana.<br/>2. The territory's boundaries had not been defined in the 1762 Treaty of Fontainebleau that ceded it from France to Spain, nor the 1800 Third Treaty of San Ildefonso ceding it back to France, nor the 1803 Louisiana Purchase agreement ceding it to the United States.The United States claimed Louisiana included the entire western portion of the Mississippi River drainage basin to the crest of the Rocky Mountains and land extending southeast to the Rio Grande and West Florida.<br/>3. Spain insisted that Louisiana comprised no more than the western bank of the Mississippi River and the cities of New Orleans and St. Louis.<br/>4. The dispute was ultimately resolved by the Adams-Onis Treaty of 1819, with the United States gaining most of what it had claimed in the west.The relatively narrow Louisiana of New Spain had been a special province under the jurisdiction of the Captaincy General of Cuba while the vast region to the west was in 1803 still considered part of the Commandancy General of the Provincias Internas.<br/>5. Louisiana had never been considered to be one of New Spain's internal provinces.If the territory included all the tributaries of the Mississippi on its western bank, the northern reaches of the Purchase extended into the equally ill-defined British possession—Rupert's Land of British North America, now part of Canada.<br/>6. The Purchase originally extended just beyond the 50th parallel.<br/>7. However, the territory north of the 49th parallel (including the Milk River and Poplar River watersheds) was ceded to the UK in exchange for parts of the Red River Basin south of 49th parallel in the Anglo-American Convention of 1818.The eastern boundary of the Louisiana purchase was the Mississippi River, from its source to the 31st parallel, although the source of the Mississippi was, at the time, unknown.<br/>8. The eastern boundary below the 31st parallel was unclear; the U.S. claimed the land as far as the Perdido River, and Spain claimed the border of its Florida Colony remained the Mississippi river.<br/>9. <strike>In early 1804, Congress passed the Mobile Act which recognized West Florida as being part of the United States.</strike><br/>10. The Adams–Onís Treaty with Spain (1819) resolved the issue upon ratification in 1821.<br/>11. Today, the 31st parallel is the northern boundary of the western half of the Florida Panhandle, and the Perdido is the western boundary of Florida.Because the western boundary was contested at the time of the Purchase, President Jefferson immediately began to organize three missions to explore and map the new territory.<br/>12. All three started from the Mississippi River.<br/>13. The Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804) traveled up the Missouri River; the Red River Expedition (1806) explored the Red River basin; the Pike Expedition (1806) also started up the Missouri, but turned south to explore the Arkansas River watershed.<br/>14. The maps and journals of the explorers helped to define the boundaries during the negotiations leading to the Adams–Onís Treaty, which set the western boundary as follows: north up the Sabine River from the Gulf of Mexico to its intersection with the 32nd parallel, due north to the Red River, up the Red River to the 100th meridian, north to the Arkansas River, up the Arkansas River to its headwaters, due north to the 42nd parallel and due west to its previous boundary.<br/>",7,When was the Anglo-American Convention?,,

The Reformation led to a series of religious wars that culminated in the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648), which devastated much of Germany, killing between 25 and 40% of its population.<br/>2. From 1618 to 1648 the Roman Catholic House of Habsburg and its allies fought against the Protestant princes of Germany, supported at various times by Denmark, Sweden and France.<br/>3. The Habsburgs, who ruled Spain, Austria, Slovene Lands, the Spanish Netherlands and much of Germany and Italy, were staunch defenders of the Roman Catholic Church.<br/>4. Some historians believe that the era of the Reformation came to a close when Roman Catholic France allied itself, first in secret and later on the battlefields, with Protestant states against the Habsburg dynasty.<br/>5. For the first time since the days of Luther, political and national convictions again outweighed religious convictions in Europe.The main tenets of the Peace of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years' War, were:<br/>6. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strike> All parties would now recognise the Peace of Augsburg of 1555, by which each prince would have the right to determine the religion of his own state, the options being Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism, and now Calvinism (the principle of ""cuius regio, eius religio"")</strike><br/>7. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christians living in principalities where their denomination was ""not"" the established church were guaranteed the right to practice their faith in public during allotted hours and in private at their will.<br/><br/>8. The treaty also effectively ended the papacy's pan-European political power.</br>9. Fully aware of the loss, Pope Innocent X declared the treaty ""null, void, invalid, iniquitous, unjust, damnable, reprobate, inane, empty of meaning and effect for all times.""<br/>10. European sovereigns, Roman Catholic and Protestant alike, ignored his verdict.However, this treaty did not mean that the Reformation concluded.<br/>11. It would be about another century (ca.<br/>12. 1750) before the Reformation could truly be considered to have ended.<br/>13. Meanwhile, other reform movements continued to spring up, even within the Reformation churches.<br/>14. One such movement was Pietism, which impacted the Low Countries (hence the Reformed churches), Germany (hence also Lutheranism), and Great Britain, which led to a split in Lutheranism and which brought about the creation of some new churches (most notably the Moravian Church and Methodism).<br/>15. In turn, Pietism would branch out into a ""normative"" form and Radical Pietism.The Reformation had a wide-ranging influence on personal life.<br/>16. In fashion, for instance, it led to a more sober and dignified, less wasteful esthetics.Further impact on the Reformation came from the Age of Enlightenment, and its preponderance of Rationalism.<br/>17. This would lead to redefined roles for religion, eventually relegating it to second-class status.In ""The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism"", Max Weber first suggested that cultural values could affect economic success, arguing that the Protestant Reformation led to values that drove people toward worldly achievements, a hard work ethic, and saving to accumulate wealth for investment.<br/>18. The new religions (in particular, Calvinism and other more austere Protestant groups) effectively forbade wastefully using hard earned money and identified the purchase of luxuries a sin.<br/>",3,What countries did the Habsburgs rule?,,

As Europeans developed a taste for tea in the 17th century, rival companies were formed to import the product from China.<br/>2. In England, Parliament gave the East India Company a monopoly on the importation of tea in 1698.<br/>3. When tea became popular in the British colonies, Parliament sought to eliminate foreign competition by passing an act in 1721 that required colonists to import their tea only from Great Britain.<br/>4. The East India Company did not export tea to the colonies; by law, the company was required to sell its tea wholesale at auctions in England.<br/>5. British firms bought this tea and exported it to the colonies, where they resold it to merchants in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston.Until 1767, the East India Company paid an ""ad valorem"" tax of about 25% on tea that it imported into Great Britain.<br/>6. Parliament laid additional taxes on tea sold for consumption in Britain.<br/>7. These high taxes, combined with the fact that tea imported into Holland was not taxed by the Dutch government, meant that Britons and British Americans could buy smuggled Dutch tea at much cheaper prices.<br/>8. <strike>The biggest market for illicit tea was England—by the 1760s the East India Company was losing £400,000 per year to smugglers in Great Britain—but Dutch tea was also smuggled into British America in significant quantities.In 1767, to help the East India Company compete with smuggled Dutch tea, Parliament passed the Indemnity Act, which lowered the tax on tea consumed in Great Britain, and gave the East India Company a refund of the 25% duty on tea that was re-exported to the colonies.</strike><br/>9. To help offset this loss of government revenue, Parliament also passed the Townshend Revenue Act of 1767, which levied new taxes, including one on tea, in the colonies.<br/>10. Instead of solving the smuggling problem, however, the Townshend duties renewed a controversy about Parliament's right to tax the colonies.<br/>",1,When the Europeans develop a taste for Tea?,,

Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of a cell's genome.<br/>2. When mutations occur, they can either have no effect, alter the product of a gene, or prevent the gene from functioning.<br/>3. Based on studies in the fly ""Drosophila melanogaster"", it has been suggested that if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene, this will probably be harmful, with about 70% of these mutations having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial.Mutations can involve large sections of a chromosome becoming duplicated (usually by genetic recombination), which can introduce extra copies of a gene into a genome.<br/>4. Extra copies of genes are a major source of the raw material needed for new genes to evolve.<br/>5. This is important because most new genes evolve within gene families from pre-existing genes that share common ancestors.<br/>6. For example, the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light: three for colour vision and one for night vision; all four are descended from a single ancestral gene.New genes can be generated from an ancestral gene when a duplicate copy mutates and acquires a new function.<br/>7. This process is easier once a gene has been duplicated because it increases the redundancy of the system; one gene in the pair can acquire a new function while the other copy continues to perform its original function.<br/>8. Other types of mutations can even generate entirely new genes from previously noncoding DNA.The generation of new genes can also involve small parts of several genes being duplicated, with these fragments then recombining to form new combinations with new functions.<br/>9.

Galileo heard about the Dutch telescope in June 1609, built his own within a month, and greatly improved upon the design in the following year.The idea that the objective, or light-gathering element, could be a mirror instead of a lens was being investigated soon after the invention of the refracting telescope.<br/>4. The potential advantages of using parabolic mirrors—reduction of spherical aberration and no chromatic aberration—led to many proposed designs and several attempts to build reflecting telescopes.<br/>5. In 1668, Isaac Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope, of a design which now bears his name, the Newtonian reflector.The invention of the achromatic lens in 1733 partially corrected color aberrations present in the simple lens and enabled the construction of shorter, more functional refracting telescopes.<br/>6. Reflecting telescopes, though not limited by the color problems seen in refractors, were hampered by the use of fast tarnishing speculum metal mirrors employed during the 18th and early 19th century—a problem alleviated by the introduction of silver coated glass mirrors in 1857, and aluminized mirrors in 1932.<br/>7. <strike>The maximum physical size limit for refracting telescopes is about 1 meter (40 inches), dictating that the vast majority of large optical researching telescopes built since the turn of the 20th century have been reflectors.</strike><br/>8.

Open questions.Entropy and thermodynamics.In 1971, Hawking showed under general conditions that the total area of the event horizons of any collection of classical black holes can never decrease, even if they collide and merge.<br/>2. This result, now known as the second law of black hole mechanics, is remarkably similar to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy of a system can never decrease.<br/>3. As with classical objects at absolute zero temperature, it was assumed that black holes had zero entropy.<br/>4. If this were the case, the second law of thermodynamics would be violated by entropy-laden matter entering a black hole, resulting in a decrease of the total entropy of the universe.<br/>5. <strike>Therefore, Bekenstein proposed that a black hole should have an entropy, and that it should be proportional to its horizon area.The link with the laws of thermodynamics was further strengthened by Hawking's discovery that quantum field theory predicts that a black hole radiates blackbody radiation at a constant temperature.</strike><br/>6. This seemingly causes a violation of the second law of black hole mechanics, since the radiation will carry away energy from the black hole causing it to shrink.<br/>7. The radiation, however also carries away entropy, and it can be proven under general assumptions that the sum of the entropy of the matter surrounding a black hole and one quarter of the area of the horizon as measured in Planck units is in fact always increasing.<br/>8. This allows the formulation of the first law of black hole mechanics as an analogue of the first law of thermodynamics, with the mass acting as energy, the surface gravity as temperature and the area as entropy.One puzzling feature is that the entropy of a black hole scales with its area rather than with its volume, since entropy is normally an extensive quantity that scales linearly with the volume of the system.<br/>9. This odd property led Gerard 't Hooft and Leonard Susskind to propose the holographic principle, which suggests that anything that happens in a volume of spacetime can be described by data on the boundary of that volume.Although general relativity can be used to perform a semi-classical calculation of black hole entropy, this situation is theoretically unsatisfying.<br/>10. In statistical mechanics, entropy is understood as counting the number of microscopic configurations of a system that have the same macroscopic qualities (such as mass, charge, pressure, etc.).<br/>11. Without a satisfactory theory of quantum gravity, one cannot perform such a computation for black holes.<br/>12. Some progress has been made in various approaches to quantum gravity.<br/>13. In 1995, Andrew Strominger and Cumrun Vafa showed that counting the microstates of a specific supersymmetric black hole in string theory reproduced the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy.<br/>14. Since then, similar results have been reported for different black holes both in string theory and in other approaches to quantum gravity like loop quantum gravity.<br/>",13,In what year did Strominger and Vafa show their black hle theory?,,

The Earth is constantly immersed in the solar wind, a rarefied flow of hot plasma (gas of free electrons and positive ions) emitted by the Sun in all directions, a result of the two-million-degree heat of the Sun's outermost layer, the corona.<br/>2. The solar wind usually reaches Earth with a velocity around 400 km/s, density around 5 ions/cm3 and magnetic field intensity around 2–5 nT (nanoteslas; Earth's surface field is typically 30,000–50,000 nT).<br/>3. These are typical values.<br/>4. During magnetic storms, in particular, flows can be several times faster; the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) may also be much stronger.The IMF originates on the Sun, related to the field of sunspots, and its field lines (lines of force) are dragged out by the solar wind.<br/>5. That alone would tend to line them up in the Sun-Earth direction, but the rotation of the Sun skews them (at Earth) by about 45 degrees, so that field lines passing Earth may actually start near the western edge (""limb"") of the visible Sun.Earth's magnetosphere is formed by the impact of the solar wind on the Earth's magnetic field.<br/>6. It forms an obstacle to the solar wind, diverting it, at an average distance of about 70,000 km (11 Earth radii or Re), forming a bow shock 12,000 km to 15,000 km (1.9 to 2.4 Re) further upstream.<br/>7. <strike>The width of the magnetosphere abreast of Earth, is typically 190,000 km (30 Re), and on the night side a long ""magnetotail"" of stretched field lines extends to great distances (> 200 Re).The magnetosphere is full of trapped plasma as the solar wind passes the Earth.</strike><br/>8. The flow of plasma into the magnetosphere increases with increases in solar wind density and speed, with increase in the southward component of the IMF and with increases in turbulence in the solar wind flow.<br/>9. The flow pattern of magnetospheric plasma is from the magnetotail toward the Earth, around the Earth and back into the solar wind through the magnetopause on the day-side.<br/>10. In addition to moving perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field, some magnetospheric plasma travel down along the Earth's magnetic field lines and lose energy to the atmosphere in the auroral zones.<br/>11. Magnetospheric electrons accelerated downward by field-aligned electric fields cause the bright aurora features.<br/>12.

Sometimes ice cream is frozen to the sides of the container, and must be allowed to thaw.Making ice cream with liquid nitrogen has advantages over conventional freezing.<br/>8. Due to the rapid freezing, the crystal grains are smaller, giving the ice cream a creamier texture, and allowing one to get the same texture by using less milkfat.<br/>9. Such ice crystals will grow very quickly via the processes of recrystallization, thereby obviating the original benefits unless steps are taken to inhibit ice crystal growth.For similar reasons, good results can also be achieved with the more readily available ""dry ice"" and authors such as Heston Blumenthal have published recipes to produce ice cream and sorbet using a simple blender.<br/>",6,When is ice cream dangerous to eat?,,

There is no conclusive evidence indicating where cheesemaking originated, either in Europe, Central Asia or the Middle East, but the practice had spread within Europe prior to Roman times and, according to Pliny the Elder, had become a sophisticated enterprise by the time the Roman Empire came into being.The earliest evidence of cheese-making in the archaeological record dates back to 5,500 BCE, in what is now Kujawy, Poland, where strainers with milk fats molecules have been found.<br/>3. Earliest proposed dates for the origin of cheesemaking range from around 8000 BCE, when sheep were first domesticated.<br/>4. <strike>Since animal skins and inflated internal organs have, since ancient times, provided storage vessels for a range of foodstuffs, it is probable that the process of cheese making was discovered accidentally by storing milk in a container made from the stomach of an animal, resulting in the milk being turned to curd and whey by the rennet from the stomach.</strike><br/>5. There is a legend – with variations – about the discovery of cheese by an Arab trader who used this method of storing milk.Cheesemaking may have begun independently of this by the pressing and salting of curdled milk to preserve it.<br/>6. Observation that the effect of making milk in an animal stomach gave more solid and better-textured curds may have led to the deliberate addition of rennet.Early archeological evidence of Egyptian cheese has been found in Egyptian tomb murals, dating to about 2000 BCE.<br/>7. The earliest cheeses were likely to have been quite sour and salty, similar in texture to rustic cottage cheese or feta, a crumbly, flavorful Greek cheese.Cheese produced in Europe, where climates are cooler than the Middle East, required less salt for preservation.<br/>8. With less salt and acidity, the cheese became a suitable environment for useful microbes and molds, giving aged cheeses their respective flavors.<br/>",2,Where were the earliest evidence of cheesemaking found?,,

Originally, coffee farming was done in the shade of trees that provided a habitat for many animals and insects.<br/>2. Remnant forest trees were used for this purpose, but many species have been planted as well.<br/>3. These include leguminous trees of the genera ""Acacia"", ""Albizia"", ""Cassia"", ""Erythrina"", ""Gliricidia"", ""Inga"", and ""Leucaena"", as well as the nitrogen-fixing non-legume sheoaks of the genus ""Casuarina"", and the silky oak ""Grevillea robusta"".This method commonly referred to as the traditional shaded method, or ""shade-grown"".<br/>4. <strike>Starting in the 1970s, many farmers switched their production method to sun cultivation, in which coffee is grown in rows under full sun with little or no forest canopy.</strike><br/>5. This causes berries to ripen more rapidly and bushes to produce higher yields, but requires the clearing of trees and increased use of fertilizer and pesticides, which damage the environment and cause health problems.Unshaded coffee plants grown with fertilizer yield the most coffee, although unfertilized shaded crops generally yield more than unfertilized unshaded crops: the response to fertilizer is much greater in full sun.<br/>6. Although traditional coffee production causes berries to ripen more slowly and produce lower yields, the quality of the coffee is allegedly superior.<br/>7. In addition, the traditional shaded method provides living space for many wildlife species.<br/>8. Proponents of shade cultivation say environmental problems such as deforestation, pesticide pollution, habitat destruction, and soil and water degradation are the side effects of the practices employed in sun cultivation.The American Birding Association, Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center, National Arbor Day Foundation, and the Rainforest Alliance have led a campaign for 'shade-grown' and organic coffees, which can be sustainably harvested.<br/>9. Shaded coffee cultivation systems show greater biodiversity than full-sun systems, and those more distant from continuous forest compare rather poorly to undisturbed native forest in terms of habitat value for some bird species.Another issue concerning coffee is its use of water.<br/>10. According to ""New Scientist"", using industrial farming practices, it takes about of water to grow the coffee seeds needed to produce one cup of coffee, and the coffee is often grown in countries where there is a water shortage, such as Ethiopia.By using sustainable agriculture methods, the amount of water usage can be dramatically reduced, while retaining comparable yields.<br/>11. For comparison, the United States Geological Survey reports that one egg requires an input of of water; one serving of milk requires an input of of water; one serving of rice requires an input of of water; and one glass of wine requires an input of of water.Coffee grounds may be used for composting or as a mulch.<br/>12. They are especially appreciated by worms and acid-loving plants such as blueberries.<br/>13. Some commercial coffee shops run initiatives to make better use of these grounds, including Starbucks' ""Grounds for your Garden"" project, and community sponsored initiatives such as ""Ground to Ground"".Starbucks sustainability chief Jim Hanna has warned that Climate change may significantly impact coffee yields within a few decades.<br/>",1,Was coffee farming done to shade other trees?,,
