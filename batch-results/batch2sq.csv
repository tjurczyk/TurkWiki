Multiple Bob Dylan songs were also played, including ""Positively 4th Street"", ""All Along the Watchtower"" and ""I Shall Be Released"".<br/>15.

Doctor Who is a British science-fiction television programme produced by the BBC.<br/>2. The programme depicts the adventures of the Doctor, a Time Lord—a time-travelling humanoid alien.<br/>3. <strike>He explores the universe in his TARDIS, a sentient time-travelling space ship.</strike><br/>4. Its exterior appears as a blue British police box, which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series first aired.<br/>5. Along with a succession of companions, the Doctor faces a variety of foes while working to save civilisations, help ordinary people, and right wrongs.The show has received recognition as one of Britain's finest television programmes, winning the 2006 British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series and five consecutive (2005–2010) awards at the National Television Awards during Russell T Davies's tenure as executive producer.<br/>6. In 2011, Matt Smith became the first Doctor to be nominated for a BAFTA Television Award for Best Actor.<br/>7. In 2013, the Peabody Awards honoured ""Doctor Who"" with an Institutional Peabody ""for evolving with technology and the times like nothing else in the known television universe.""<br/>8. The programme is listed in ""Guinness World Records"" as the longest-running science fiction television show in the world, the ""most successful"" science fiction series of all time—based on its over-all broadcast ratings, DVD and book sales, and iTunes traffic— and for the largest ever simulcast of a TV drama with its 50th anniversary special.<br/>9. During its original run, it was recognised for its imaginative stories, creative low-budget special effects, and pioneering use of electronic music (originally produced by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop).The show is a significant part of British popular culture,</ref> and elsewhere it has become a cult television favourite.<br/>10. The show has influenced generations of British television professionals, many of whom grew up watching the series.<br/>11. The programme originally ran from 1963 to 1989.<br/>12. After an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a backdoor pilot in the form of a television film, the programme was relaunched in 2005 by Russell T Davies who was showrunner and head writer for the first five years of its revival, produced in-house by BBC Wales in Cardiff.<br/>13. The first series of the 21st century, featuring Christopher Eccleston in the title role, was produced by the BBC.<br/>14. Series two and three had some development money contributed by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), which was credited as a co-producer.<br/>15. ""Doctor Who"" also spawned spin-offs in multiple media, including ""Torchwood"" (2006–11) and ""The Sarah Jane Adventures"" (2007–11), both created by Russell T Davies; ""K-9"" (2009–10); and a single pilot episode of ""K-9 and Company"" (1981).<br/>16. There also have been many spoofs and cultural references of the character in other media.Eleven actors have headlined the series as the Doctor.<br/>17. The transition from one actor to another, and the differing approach to the role that they bring, is written into the plot of the show as regeneration into a new incarnation, a life process of Time Lords through which the character of the Doctor takes on a new body and, to some extent, new personality, which occurs after sustaining injury which would be fatal to most other species.<br/>18. While each actor's portrayal differs, they are all intended to be aspects of the same character, and form part of the same storyline.<br/>19. The time-travelling nature of the plot means that on occasion, story arcs have involved different Doctors meeting each other.<br/>20. The Doctor is currently portrayed by Peter Capaldi, who took on the role after Matt Smith's final appearance in the 2013 Christmas special ""The Time of the Doctor"".<br/>",1,Who is Doctor Who produced by?,,

Human habitation of Stone Mountain and its surroundings date back into prehistory.<br/>2. When the mountain was first encountered by European explorers, its summit was encircled by a rock wall, similar to that still to be found on Georgia's Fort Mountain.<br/>3. The wall is believed to have been built by early Native American inhabitants of the area, although its purpose remains unclear.<br/>4. By the beginning of the 20th century the wall had disappeared, the rocks having been taken away by early visitors as souvenirs, rolled down the rockface, or removed by the commercial quarrying operation.<br/>5. The mountain was as well the eastern end of the Campbelton Trail, a Native American path that ran through what is now the Atlanta area.Europeans first learned of the mountain in 1597, when Spanish explorers were told of a mountain further inland which was ""very high, shining when the sun set like a fire.""<br/>6. By this time, the Stone Mountain area was inhabited by the Creek and (to a lesser extent) Cherokee peoples.<br/>7. In 1790 the mountain was the site of a meeting initiated by President George Washington in hopes of negotiating a peace treaty with the Creek.<br/>8. Instead a series of wars ensued, and the Creek were forced to cede the land to the state of Georgia in 1821.In the early 19th century, the area was known as Rock Mountain.<br/>9. After the founding of DeKalb County and the county seat of Decatur in 1822 Stone Mountain was a natural recreation area; it was common for young men to take their dates on horseback from Decatur to the mountain.Entrepreneur Aaron Cloud built a 165 foot (50 m) wooden observation tower at the summit of the mountain in 1838, but it was destroyed by a storm and replaced by a much smaller tower in 1851.<br/>10. Visitors to the mountain would travel to the area by rail and road, and then walk up the 1.1 mile mountaintop trail to the top, where Cloud also had a restaurant and club.Granite quarrying started at Stone Mountain in the 1830s, but became a major industry following the completion of a railroad spur to the quarry site in 1847.<br/>11. This line was rebuilt by the Georgia Railroad in 1869.<br/>12. Over the years, Stone Mountain granite was used in many buildings and structures, including the locks of the Panama Canal, the steps to the East Wing of the United States Capitol and the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo.<br/>13. In recent years, granite suppliers in Georgia sent stone samples cut from Stone Mountain to the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Foundation to be considered for use in a planned monument in King's honor; the Foundation later chose to use granite imported from China.<br/>14. Unfortunately, quarrying during earlier periods also destroyed several spectacular geological features on Stone Mountain, such as the Devil's Crossroads, which was located on top of the mountain.In 1887 Stone Mountain was purchased for $45,000 by the Venable Brothers of Atlanta, who quarried the mountain for 24 more years, and descendents of the Venable family would retain ownership of the mountain until it was purchased by the State of Georgia in the 1950s.Martin Luther King, Jr. mentioned the monument in his 1963 ""I Have a Dream"" speech in Washington, D.C., when he said ""let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia!""<br/>15. <strike>During the 1996 Summer Olympics, Stone Mountain Park provided venues for Olympic events in tennis, archery and track cycling.</strike><br/>16.

NASA claims that it is barely visible, and only under nearly perfect conditions; it is no more conspicuous than many other man-made objects.<br/>3. Other authors have argued that due to limitations of the optics of the eye and the spacing of photoreceptors on the retina, it is impossible to see the wall with the naked eye, even from low orbit, and would require visual acuity of 20/3 (7.7 times better than normal).Astronaut William Pogue thought he had seen it from Skylab but discovered he was actually looking at the Grand Canal of China near Beijing.<br/>4.

It was so indistinct that the photographer was not certain he had actually captured it.<br/>18. Based on the photograph, the ""China Daily"" later reported that the Great Wall can be seen from space with the naked eye, under favorable viewing conditions, if one knows exactly where to look.<br/>19. However, the resolution of a camera can be much higher than the human visual system, and the optics much better, rendering photographic evidence irrelevant to the issue of whether it is visible to the naked eye.<br/>",6,Who claimed to see the Great Wall from the space shuttle?,,

The park contains the largest active geyser in the world—Steamboat Geyser in the Norris Geyser Basin.<br/>4. A study that was completed in 2011 found that at least 1283 geysers have erupted in Yellowstone.<br/>5. Of these, an average of 465 are active in a given year.<br/>6. Yellowstone contains at least 10,000 geothermal features altogether.<br/>7. Half the geothermal features and two-thirds of the world's geysers are concentrated in Yellowstone.In May 2001, the U.S. Geological Survey, Yellowstone National Park, and the University of Utah created the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory (YVO), a partnership for long-term monitoring of the geological processes of the Yellowstone Plateau volcanic field, for disseminating information concerning the potential hazards of this geologically active region.In 2003, changes at the Norris Geyser Basin resulted in the temporary closure of some trails in the basin.<br/>8. New fumaroles were observed, and several geysers showed enhanced activity and increasing water temperatures.<br/>9. Several geysers became so hot that they were transformed into purely steaming features; the water had become superheated and they could no longer erupt normally.<br/>10. This coincided with the release of reports of a multiple year United States Geological Survey research project which mapped the bottom of Yellowstone Lake and identified a structural dome that had uplifted at some time in the past.<br/>11. Research indicated that these uplifts posed no immediate threat of a volcanic eruption, since they may have developed long ago, and there had been no temperature increase found near the uplifts.<br/>12. On March 10, 2004, a biologist discovered 5 dead bison which apparently had inhaled toxic geothermal gases trapped in the Norris Geyser Basin by a seasonal atmospheric inversion.<br/>13. This was closely followed by an upsurge of earthquake activity in April 2004.<br/>14. In 2006, it was reported that the Mallard Lake Dome and the Sour Creek Dome— areas that have long been known to show significant changes in their ground movement— had risen at a rate of per year from mid–2004 through 2006.<br/>15. As of late 2007, the uplift has continued at a reduced rate.<br/>16. These events inspired a great deal of media attention and speculation about the geologic future of the region.<br/>17. Experts responded to the conjecture by informing the public that there was no increased risk of a volcanic eruption in the near future.<br/>18. However, these changes demonstrate the dynamic nature of the Yellowstone hydrothermal system.<br/>",12,"How many dead bison did biologists discovered on March 10, 2004?",,

Biology.Habitats.With its scrubby sun-baked chaparral, stately groves of pine, fir, and sequoia, and expanses of alpine woodlands and meadows, Yosemite National Park preserves a Sierra Nevada landscape as it prevailed before Euro-American settlement.<br/>2. In contrast to surrounding lands, which have been significantly altered by logging, the park still contains some of old-growth forest.<br/>3. <strike>Taken together, the park's varied habitats support over 250 species of vertebrates, which include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.Along much of Yosemite's western boundary, habitats are dominated by mixed coniferous forests of Ponderosa Pine, Sugar Pine, Incense-cedar, White Fir, Douglas Fir, and a few stands of Giant Sequoia, interspersed by areas of Black Oak and Canyon Live Oak.</strike><br/>4. A relatively high diversity of wildlife species is supported by these habitats, because of relatively mild, lower-elevation climate and the mixture of habitat types and plant species.<br/>5. Wildlife species typically found in these habitats include American black bear, Bobcat, Cougar, Gray fox, Mule deer, Mountain kingsnake, Gilbert's skink, White-headed Woodpecker, Brown Creeper, Spotted Owl, and a wide variety of bat species.<br/>6. In the case of bats, large snags are important as roost sites.Going higher in elevation, the coniferous forests become purer stands of Red Fir, Western White Pine, Jeffrey Pine, Lodgepole Pine, and the occasional Foxtail pine.<br/>7. Fewer wildlife species tend to be found in these habitats, because of their higher elevation and lower complexity.<br/>8. Species likely to be found include Golden-mantled Ground Squirrel, Chickaree, Fisher, Steller's Jay, Hermit Thrush, and Northern Goshawk.<br/>9. Reptiles are not common, but include Rubber Boa, western fence lizard, and Northern Alligator Lizard.As the landscape rises, trees become smaller and more sparse, with stands broken by areas of exposed granite.<br/>10. These include Lodgepole Pine, Whitebark Pine, and Mountain Hemlock that, at highest elevations, give way to vast expanses of granite as treeline is reached.<br/>11. The climate in these habitats is harsh and the growing season is short, but species such as Pika, Yellow-bellied Marmot, White-tailed Jackrabbit, Clark's Nutcracker, and Black Rosy Finch are adapted to these conditions.<br/>12. Also, the treeless alpine habitats are the areas favored by Sierra Nevada Bighorn Sheep.<br/>13. This species, however, is now found in the Yosemite area only around Tioga Pass, where a small, reintroduced population exists.At a variety of elevations, meadows provide important, productive habitat for wildlife.<br/>14. Animals come to feed on the green grasses and use the flowing and standing water found in many meadows.<br/>15. Predators, in turn, are attracted to these areas.<br/>16. The interface between meadow and forest is also favored by many animal species because of the proximity of open areas for foraging and cover for protection.<br/>17. Species that are highly dependent upon meadow habitat include Great Grey Owl, Willow Flycatcher, Yosemite Toad, and Mountain Beaver.<br/>",4,Why is a relatively high diversity of wildlife species supported in Yosemite?,,

Called the Legacy Light or Skybeam, it is powered by lamps that total 85 million candela shining skyward from the top of the Space Needle to honor national holidays and special occasions in Seattle.<br/>13. The concept of this beam was derived from the official 1962 World's Fair poster, which depicted such a light source although none was incorporated into the original design.<br/>14. It is somewhat controversial because of the light pollution it creates.<br/>15. Originally planned to be turned on 75 nights per year, it has generally been used fewer than a dozen times per year.<br/>16. It did remain lit for eleven days in a row from September 11, 2001, to September 22, 2001, in response to the September 11, 2001 attacks.The same 1962 World's Fair original poster showed a grand spiral entryway leading to the elevator, but this, too, was omitted from the final building plans.<br/>17.

After his death, memorial exhibitions were mounted in Brussels, Paris, The Hague and Antwerp.<br/>3. In the early 20th century, there were retrospectives in Paris (1901 and 1905), and Amsterdam (1905), and important group exhibitions in Cologne (1912), New York (1913) and Berlin (1914).<br/>4.

The well-known surrealist piece introduced the image of the soft melting pocket watch.<br/>2. It epitomizes Dalí's theory of ""softness"" and ""hardness"", which was central to his thinking at the time.<br/>3. As Dawn Ades wrote, ""The soft watches are an unconscious symbol of the relativity of space and time, a Surrealist meditation on the collapse of our notions of a fixed cosmic order"".<br/>4. This interpretation suggests that Dalí was incorporating an understanding of the world introduced by Albert Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity.<br/>5. Asked by Ilya Prigogine whether this was in fact the case, Dalí replied that the soft watches were not inspired by the theory of relativity, but by the surrealist perception of a Camembert cheese melting in the sun.Although fundamentally part of Dalí's Freudian phase, the imagery precedes his transition to his scientific phase by fourteen years, which occurred after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.It is possible to recognize a human figure in the middle of the composition, in the strange ""monster"" that Dalí used in several contemporary pieces to represent himself – the abstract form becoming something of a self-portrait, reappearing frequently in his work.<br/>6.

From September 1513 to 1516, under Pope Leo X, Leonardo spent much of his time living in the Belvedere in the Vatican in Rome, where Raphael and Michelangelo were both active at the time.<br/>2. In October 1515, Francis I of France recaptured Milan.<br/>3. On December 19, Leonardo was present at the meeting of Francis I and Pope Leo X, which took place in Bologna.<br/>4. Leonardo was commissioned to make for Francis a mechanical lion which could walk forward, then open its chest to reveal a cluster of lilies.<br/>5. In 1516, he entered François' service, being given the use of the manor house Clos Lucé near the king's residence at the royal Château d'Amboise.<br/>6.

In Florence, Donatello assisted Lorenzo Ghiberti with the statues of prophets for the north door of the Florence Baptistery, for which he received payment in November 1406 and early 1408.<br/>2. In 1409–1411 he executed the colossal seated figure of ""Saint John the Evangelist"", which until 1588 occupied a niche of the old cathedral façade, and is now placed in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo.<br/>3. This work marks a decisive step forward from late Gothic Mannerism in the search for naturalism and the rendering of human feelings.<br/>4. The face, the shoulders and the bust are still idealized, while the hands and the fold of cloth over the legs are more realistic.In 1411–1413, Donatello worked on a statue of St. Mark for the guild church of Orsanmichele.<br/>5. <strike>In 1417 he completed the ""Saint George"" for the Confraternity of the Cuirass-makers.</strike><br/>6.

Donatello had also sculpted the classical frame for this work, which remains, while the statue was moved in 1460 and replaced by ""Incredulity of Saint Thomas"" by Verrocchio.Between 1415 and 1426, Donatello created five statues for the campanile of Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence, also known as the Duomo.<br/>9. These works are the ""Beardless Prophet""; ""Bearded Prophet"" (both from 1415); the ""Sacrifice of Isaac"" (1421); ""Habbakuk"" (1423–1425); and ""Jeremiah"" (1423–1426); which follow the classical models for orators and are characterized by strong portrait details.<br/>10. From the late teens is the ""Pazzi Madonna"" relief in Berlin.<br/>11. In 1425, he executed the notable ""Crucifix"" for Santa Croce; this work portrays Christ in a moment of the agony, eyes and mouth partially opened, the body contracted in an ungraceful posture.From 1425–1427, Donatello collaborated with Michelozzo on the funerary monument of the Antipope John XXIII for the Battistero in Florence.<br/>12. Donatello made the recumbent bronze figure of the deceased, under a shell.<br/>13. In 1427, he completed in Pisa a marble relief for the funerary monument of Cardinal Rainaldo Brancacci at the church of Sant'Angelo a Nilo in Naples.<br/>14. In the same period, he executed the relief of the ""Feast of Herod"" and the statues of ""Faith"" and ""Hope"" for the Baptistery of San Giovanni in Siena.<br/>15.

At the outbreak of the Second World War the Chelsea School of Art was evacuated to Northampton and Moore resigned his teaching post.<br/>2. During the war, Moore produced powerful drawings of Londoners sleeping in the London Underground while sheltering from the Blitz.<br/>3. Kenneth Clark, the chairman of the War Artists' Advisory Committee,WAAC, had previously tried to recruit Moore as a full-time salaried war artist and now agreed to purchase some of the shelter drewings and issued contracts for further examples.<br/>4. The shelter drawings WAAC acquired were completed between the autumn of 1940 and the spring of 1941 and are regarded as among the finest products of the WAAC scheme.<br/>5. In August 1941 WAAC commissioned Moore to drew miners working underground at the Wheldale Colliery in Yorkshire, where his father had worked at the start of the century.<br/>6. Whereas Moore drew the people in the shelters as passively waiting the all-clear he shows the miners aggressively working the coal-faces.<br/>7. These drawings helped to boost Moore's international reputation, particularly in America where examples were included in the WAAC ""Britain at War"" exhibition which toured North America throughout the war.After their Hampstead home was hit by bomb shrapnel in September 1940, Moore and Irina moved out of London to live in a farmhouse called Hoglands in the hamlet of Perry Green near Much Hadham, Hertfordshire.<br/>8.

Shooting is the act of attempting to score points by throwing the ball through the basket, methods varying with players and situations.Typically, a player faces the basket with both feet facing the basket.<br/>2. A player will rest the ball on the fingertips of the dominant hand (the shooting arm) slightly above the head, with the other hand supporting the side of the ball.<br/>3. The ball is usually shot by jumping (though not always) and extending the shooting arm.<br/>4. The shooting arm, fully extended with the wrist fully bent, is held stationary for a moment following the release of the ball, known as a ""follow-through"".<br/>5. Players often try to put a steady backspin on the ball to absorb its impact with the rim.<br/>6. The ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat controversial, but generally a proper arc is recommended.<br/>7. Players may shoot directly into the basket or may use the backboard to redirect the ball into the basket.The two most common shots that use the above described setup are the ""set-shot"" and the ""jump-shot"".<br/>8. The set-shot is taken from a standing position, with neither foot leaving the floor, typically used for free throws, and in other circumstances whilst the jump-shot is taken in mid-air, the ball released near the top of the jump.<br/>9. This provides much greater power and range, and it also allows the player to elevate over the defender.<br/>10. <strike>Failure to release the ball before the feet return to the floor is considered a traveling violation.Another common shot is called the ""lay-up"".</strike><br/>11. This shot requires the player to be in motion toward the basket, and to ""lay"" the ball ""up"" and into the basket, typically off the backboard (the backboard-free, underhand version is called a ""finger roll"").<br/>12. The most crowd-pleasing and typically highest-percentage accuracy shot is the ""slam dunk"", in which the player jumps very high and throws the ball downward, through the basket whilst touching it.Another shot that is becoming common is the ""circus shot"".<br/>13. The circus shot is a low-percentage shot that is flipped, heaved, scooped, or flung toward the hoop while the shooter is off-balance, airborne, falling down, and/or facing away from the basket.<br/>14. A back-shot is a shot taken when the player is facing away from the basket, and may be shot with the dominant hand, or both; but there is a very low chance that the shot will be successful.A shot that misses both the rim and the backboard completely is referred to as an ""air-ball"".<br/>15. A particularly bad shot, or one that only hits the backboard, is jocularly called a brick.<br/>",15,What is a brick?,,

Some juniors, however, such as Australian Lleyton Hewitt and Frenchman Gaël Monfils, have catapulted directly from the junior tour to the ATP tour by dominating the junior scene or by taking advantage of opportunities given to them to participate in professional tournaments.In 2004, the ITF implemented a new rankings scheme to encourage greater participation in doubles, by combining two rankings (singles and doubles) into one combined tally.<br/>7. <strike>Junior tournaments do not offer prize money except for the Grand Slam tournaments, which are the most prestigious junior events.</strike><br/>8.

The lightness of the shuttlecock and of badminton rackets allow badminton players to make use of the wrist and fingers much more than tennis players; in tennis the wrist is normally held stable, and playing with a mobile wrist may lead to injury.<br/>3. For the same reasons, badminton players can generate power from a short racket swing: for some strokes such as net kills, an elite player's swing may be less than .<br/>4. For strokes that require more power, a longer swing will typically be used, but the badminton racket swing will rarely be as long as a typical tennis swing.It is often asserted that power in badminton strokes comes mainly from the wrist.<br/>5. This is a misconception and may be criticised for two reasons.<br/>6. First, it is strictly speaking a category error: the wrist is a joint, not a muscle; the forearm muscles control its movement.<br/>7. Second, wrist movements are weak when compared to forearm or upper arm movements.<br/>8.

The country lies between latitudes 41° and 84°N, and longitudes 52° and 141°W.Since 1925, Canada has claimed the portion of the Arctic between 60° and 141°W longitude, but this claim is not universally recognized.<br/>7. Canada is home to the world's northernmost settlement, Canadian Forces Station Alert, on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island – latitude 82.5°N – which lies from the North Pole.<br/>8. Much of the Canadian Arctic is covered by ice and permafrost.<br/>9. Canada has the longest coastline in the world, with a total length of ; additionally, its border with the United States is the world's longest land border, stretching .Since the end of the last glacial period, Canada has consisted of eight distinct forest regions, including extensive boreal forest on the Canadian Shield.<br/>10. Canada has around 31,700 large lakes, more than any other country, containing much of the world's fresh water.There are also fresh-water glaciers in the Canadian Rockies and the Coast Mountains.Canada is geologically active, having many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes, notably Mount Meager, Mount Garibaldi, Mount Cayley, and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.<br/>11. The volcanic eruption of the Tseax Cone in 1775 was among Canada's worst natural disasters, killing 2,000 Nisga'a people and destroying their village in the Nass River valley of northern British Columbia.<br/>12.

""""The Lord of the Rings"" developed as a personal exploration by Tolkien of his interests in philology, religion (particularly Roman Catholicism), fairy tales, Norse and general Germanic mythology, and also Celtic, Slavic, Persian, Greek, and Finnish mythology.<br/>5. Tolkien acknowledged, and external critics have verified, the influences of George MacDonald and William Morris and the Anglo-Saxon poem ""Beowulf"".<br/>6. The question of a direct influence of Wagner's ""The Nibelung's Ring"" on Tolkien's work is debated by critics.Tolkien included neither any explicit religion nor cult in his work.<br/>7. Rather the themes, moral philosophy, and cosmology of the Lord of the Rings reflect his Catholic worldview.<br/>8.

Some critics argue that the setting of a criminal counterculture allows for unapologetic gender stereotyping, and is an important part of the film's appeal (""You can act like a man!<br/>12. "", Don Vito tells a weepy Johnny Fontane).Real-life gangsters responded enthusiastically to the film, with many of them feeling it was a portrayal of how they were supposed to act.<br/>13. <strike>Salvatore ""Sammy the Bull"" Gravano, the former underboss in the Gambino crime family, stated: ""I left the movie stunned ...</strike><br/>14.

According to Anthony Fiato after seeing the film, Patriarca crime family members Paulie Intiso and Nicky Giso altered their speech patterns closer to that of Vito Corleone's.<br/>19. Intiso would frequently swear and use poor grammar; but after the movie came out, he started to articulate and philosophize more.Remarking on the 40th anniversary of the film's release, film critic John Podhoretz praised ""The Godfather"" as ""arguably ""the"" great American work of popular art"" and ""the summa of all great moviemaking before it"".<br/>20. Two years before, Roger Ebert wrote in his journal that it ""comes closest to being a film everyone agrees... is unquestionably great.""<br/>",2,What percentage of critics from Rotten Tomatoes gave The Godfather a positive review?,,

Screenwriter Jim Uhls started working on an early draft of the adapted screenplay, which excluded a voice-over because the industry perceived at the time that the technique was ""hackneyed and trite"".<br/>2. When Fincher joined the film, he thought that the film should have a voice-over, believing that the film's humor came from the narrator's voice.<br/>3. The director described the film without a voice-over as seemingly ""sad and pathetic"".<br/>4. Fincher and Uhls revised the script for six to seven months and by 1997 had a third draft that reordered the story and left out several major elements.<br/>5. <strike>When Pitt was cast, he was concerned that his character, Tyler Durden, was too one-dimensional.</strike><br/>6. Fincher sought the advice of writer-director Cameron Crowe, who suggested giving the character more ambiguity.<br/>7. Fincher also hired screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker for assistance.<br/>8. The director invited Pitt and Norton to help revise the script, and the group drafted five revisions in the course of a year.Chuck Palahniuk praised the faithful film adaptation of his novel and applauded how the film's plot was more streamlined than the book's.<br/>9. Palahniuk recalled how the writers debated if film audiences would believe the plot twist from the novel.<br/>10. Fincher supported including the twist, arguing, ""If they accept everything up to this point, they'll accept the plot twist.<br/>11. If they're still in the theater, they'll stay with it.""<br/>12. Palahniuk's novel also contained homoerotic overtones, which the director included in the film to make audiences uncomfortable and accentuate the surprise of the film's twists.<br/>13. The bathroom scene where Tyler Durden bathes next to the narrator is an example of the overtones; the line, ""I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need,"" was meant to suggest personal responsibility rather than homosexuality.<br/>14. Another example is the scene at the beginning of the film in which Tyler Durden puts a gun barrel down the narrator's mouth.The narrator finds redemption at the end of the film by rejecting Tyler Durden's dialectic, a path that diverged from the novel's ending in which the narrator is placed in a mental institution.<br/>15. Norton drew parallels between redemption in the film and redemption in ""The Graduate"", indicating that the protagonists of both films find a middle ground between two divisions of self.<br/>16. Fincher considered the novel too infatuated with Tyler Durden and changed the ending to move away from him: ""I wanted people to love Tyler, but I also wanted them to be OK with his vanquishing.""<br/>",8,Who did the director invite to revise the script?,,

The Matrix is a 1999 American–Australian science fiction action film written and directed by The Wachowski Brothers, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano.<br/>2. It depicts a dystopian future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called ""the Matrix"", created by sentient machines to subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source.<br/>3. Computer programmer ""Neo"" learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, which involves other people who have been freed from the ""dream world"".<br/>4. ""The Matrix"" is known for popularizing a visual effect known as ""bullet time"", in which the heightened perception of certain characters is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow-motion while the camera's viewpoint appears to move through the scene at normal speed.<br/>5. The film is an example of the cyberpunk science fiction genre.<br/>6. It contains numerous references to philosophical and religious ideas, and prominently pays homage to works such as Plato's Allegory of the Cave, Jean Baudrillard's ""Simulacra and Simulation"" and Lewis Carroll's ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"".<br/>7. The Wachowskis' approach to action scenes drew upon their admiration for Japanese animation and martial arts films, and the film's use of fight choreographers and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema was influential upon subsequent Hollywood action film productions.<br/>8.

The success of the film led to the release of two feature film sequels, both written and directed by the Wachowski Brothers, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""The Matrix Revolutions"".<br/>14.

Previous film incarnations of the Batsuit had been stiff and especially restricted full head movement.<br/>3. Costume designer Lindy Hemming and her crew worked on the Batsuit at an FX workshop codenamed ""Cape Town"", a secured compound located at Shepperton Studios in London.<br/>4. The Batsuit's basic design was a neoprene undersuit, which was shaped by attaching molded cream latex sections.<br/>5. Christian Bale was molded and sculpted prior to his physical training so the team could work on a full body cast.<br/>6. To avoid imperfections picked up by sculpting with clay, plastiline was used to smooth the surface.<br/>7. In addition, the team brewed different mixtures of foam to find the mixture that would be the most flexible, light, durable, and black.<br/>8. <strike>The latter presented a problem, since the process to make the foam black reduced the foam's durability.For the cape, director Christopher Nolan wanted to have a ""flowing cloak... that blows and flows as in so many great graphic novels"".</strike><br/>9. Hemming's team created the cape out of their own version of parachute nylon that had electrostatic flocking, a process shared with the team by the British Ministry of Defence.<br/>10. The process was used by the London police force to minimize night vision detection.<br/>11. The cape was topped by a cowl, which was designed by Nolan, Hemming, and costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard.<br/>12. The cowl was created to be thin enough to allow motion but thick enough to avoid wrinkling when Bale turned his head in the Batsuit.<br/>13. Churchyard explained the cowl had been designed to show ""a man who has angst"", so his character would be revealed through the mask.<br/>",3,Who created the new Batsuit?,,

These advances allowed for impressive defence systems, which out-of-date military tactics could not break through for most of the war.<br/>3. Barbed wire was a significant hindrance to massed infantry advances.<br/>4. Artillery, vastly more lethal than in the 1870s, coupled with machine guns, made crossing open ground extremely difficult.<br/>5. Commanders on both sides failed to develop tactics for breaching entrenched positions without heavy casualties.<br/>6. In time, however, technology began to produce new offensive weapons, such as gas warfare and the tank.Just after the First Battle of the Marne (5–12 September 1914), both Entente and German forces each continually sought to outflank the other by manoeuvering to the north: this series of manoeuvres became known as the ""Race to the Sea"".<br/>7. When these outflanking efforts failed, Britain and France soon found themselves facing an uninterrupted line of entrenched German forces from Lorraine to Belgium's coast.<br/>8. Britain and France sought to take the offensive, while Germany defended the occupied territories.<br/>9. Consequently, German trenches were much better constructed than those of their enemy; Anglo-French trenches were only intended to be ""temporary"" before their forces broke through German defences.Both sides tried to break the stalemate using scientific and technological advances.<br/>10. <strike>On 22 April 1915, at the Second Battle of Ypres, the Germans (violating the Hague Convention) used chlorine gas for the first time on the Western Front.</strike><br/>11. Several types of gas soon became widely used by both sides, and though it never proved a decisive, battle-winning weapon, poison gas became one of the most-feared and best-remembered horrors of the war.<br/>12. Tanks were first used in combat by the British during the Battle of Flers-Courcelette (part of the wider Somme offensive) on 15 September 1916, with only partial success.<br/>13. However, their effectiveness would grow as the war progressed; the Germans employed only very small numbers of their own design, supplemented by captured Allied tanks.<br/>",7,"Where did Britain and France face an uninterrupted line of entrenched German forces, from Lorraine to where?",,

In October 1940, Italy started the Greco-Italian War due to Mussolini's jealousy of Hitler's success but within days was repulsed and pushed back into Albania, where a stalemate soon occurred.<br/>3. The United Kingdom responded to Greek requests for assistance by sending troops to Crete and providing air support to Greece.<br/>4. Hitler decided to take action against Greece when the weather improved to assist the Italians and prevent the British from gaining a foothold in the Balkans, to strike against the British naval dominance of the Mediterranean, and to secure his hold on Romanian oil.In December 1940, British Commonwealth forces began counter-offensives against Italian forces in Egypt and Italian East Africa.<br/>5. The offensive in North Africa was highly successful and by early February 1941 Italy had lost control of eastern Libya and large numbers of Italian troops had been taken prisoner.<br/>6. The Italian Navy also suffered significant defeats, with the Royal Navy putting three Italian battleships out of commission by a carrier attack at Taranto, and neutralising several more warships at the Battle of Cape Matapan.The Germans soon intervened to assist Italy.<br/>7. Hitler sent German forces to Libya in February, and by the end of March they had launched an offensive which drove back the Commonwealth forces who had been weakened to support Greece.<br/>8. In under a month, Commonwealth forces were pushed back into Egypt with the exception of the besieged port of Tobruk.<br/>9. The Commonwealth attempted to dislodge Axis forces in May and again in June, but failed on both occasions.By late March 1941, following Bulgaria's signing of the Tripartite Pact, the Germans were in position to intervene in Greece.<br/>10. Plans were changed, however, due to developments in neighbouring Yugoslavia.<br/>11.

The centrifuge process was regarded as the only promising separation method in April 1942.<br/>2. Jesse Beams had developed such a process at the University of Virginia during the 1930s, but had encountered technical difficulties.<br/>3. The process required high rotational speeds, but at certain speeds harmonic vibrations developed that threatened to tear the machinery apart.<br/>4. It was therefore necessary to accelerate quickly through these speeds.<br/>5. In 1941 he began working with uranium hexafluoride, the only known gaseous compound of uranium, and was able to separate uranium-235.<br/>6. At Columbia, Urey had Cohen investigate the process, and he produced a body of mathematical theory making it possible to design a centrifugal separation unit, which Westinghouse undertook to construct.Scaling this up to a production plant presented a formidable technical challenge.<br/>7. Urey and Cohen estimated that producing a kilogram (2.2 lb) of uranium-235 per day would require up to 50,000 centrifuges with rotors, or 10,000 centrifuges with rotors, assuming that 4-meter rotors could be built.<br/>8. The prospect of keeping so many rotors operating continuously at high speed appeared daunting, and when Beams ran his experimental apparatus, he obtained only 60% of the predicted yield, indicating that more centrifuges would be required.<br/>9.

The success of the Counter-Reformation on the Continent and the growth of a Puritan party dedicated to further Protestant reform polarised the Elizabethan Age, although it was not until the '40s that England underwent religious strife comparable to what its neighbours had suffered some generations before.The early ""Puritan movement"" (late 16th–17th centuries) was Reformed or Calvinist and was a movement for reform in the Church of England.<br/>2. Its origins lay in the discontent with the Elizabethan Religious Settlement.<br/>3. The desire was for the Church of England to resemble more closely the Protestant churches of Europe, especially Geneva.<br/>4. The Puritans objected to ornaments and ritual in the churches as idolatrous (vestments, surplices, organs, genuflection), which they castigated as ""popish pomp and rags"".<br/>5. (See Vestments controversy.)<br/>6. They also objected to ecclesiastical courts.<br/>7. They refused to endorse completely all of the ritual directions and formulas of the ""Book of Common Prayer""; the imposition of its liturgical order by legal force and inspection sharpened Puritanism into a definite opposition movement.The later Puritan movement were often referred to as dissenters and nonconformists and eventually led to the formation of various reformed denominations.The most famous and well-known emigration to America was the migration of the Puritan separatists from the Anglican Church of England, who fled first to Holland, and then later to America, to establish the English colony of Massachusetts in New England, which later became one of the original United States.These Puritan separatists were also known as ""the Pilgrims"".<br/>8. After establishing a colony at Plymouth (which became part of the colony of Massachusetts) in 1620, the Puritan pilgrims received a charter from the King of England that legitimised their colony, allowing them to do trade and commerce with merchants in England, in accordance with the principles of mercantilism.<br/>9. This successful, though initially quite difficult, colony marked the beginning of the Protestant presence in America (the earlier French, Spanish and Portuguese settlements had been Roman Catholic), and became a kind of oasis of spiritual and economic freedom, to which persecuted Protestants and other minorities from the British Isles and Europe (and later, from all over the world) fled to for peace, freedom and opportunity.<br/>10. <strike>The Pilgrims of New England disapproved of Christmas and celebration was outlawed in Boston from 1659 to 1681.</strike><br/>11. The ban was revoked in 1681 by Sir Edmund Andros, who also revoked a Puritan ban against festivities on Saturday night.<br/>12. Despite the removal of the ban, it wouldn't be until the middle of the 19th century that Christmas would become a popular holiday in the Boston region.The original intent of the colonists was to establish spiritual Puritanism, which had been denied to them in England and the rest of Europe, to engage in peaceful commerce with England and the native American Indians, and to Christianize the peoples of the Americas.<br/>",6,Did they object to ecclesiastical courts?,,

According to Whigs, colonists could only be taxed by their own colonial assemblies.<br/>7.

Smuggling continued apace, especially in New York and Philadelphia, where tea smuggling had always been more extensive than in Boston.<br/>10. Dutied British tea continued to be imported into Boston, however, especially by Richard Clarke and the sons of Massachusetts Governor Thomas Hutchinson, until pressure from Massachusetts Whigs compelled them to abide by the non-importation agreement.Parliament finally responded to the protests by repealing the Townshend taxes in 1770, except for the tea duty, which Prime Minister Lord North kept to assert ""the right of taxing the Americans"".<br/>11. This partial repeal of the taxes was enough to bring an end to the non-importation movement by October 1770.<br/>12. From 1771 to 1773, British tea was once again imported into the colonies in significant amounts, with merchants paying the Townshend duty of three pence per pound.<br/>13. Boston was the largest colonial importer of legal tea; smugglers still dominated the market in New York and Philadelphia.<br/>",5,Why did the American Whigs believe Parliament couldn't tax the colonies?,,

There were multiple causes for the first downturn in 1929.<br/>2. These include the structural weaknesses and specific events that turned it into a major depression and the manner in which the downturn spread from country to country.<br/>3. In relation to the 1929 downturn, historians emphasize structural factors like major bank failures and the stock market crash.<br/>4. In contrast, monetarist economists (such as Barry Eichengreen, Milton Friedman and Peter Temin) point to monetary factors such as actions by the US Federal Reserve that contracted the money supply, as well as Britain's decision to return to the gold standard at pre–World War I parities (US$4.86:£1).Recessions and business cycles are thought to be a normal part of living in a world of inexact balances between supply and demand.<br/>5. What turns a normal recession or 'ordinary' business cycle into a depression is a subject of much debate and concern.<br/>6. Scholars have not agreed on the exact causes and their relative importance.<br/>7. <strike>The search for causes is closely connected to the issue of avoiding future depressions.</strike><br/>8. A related question is whether the Great Depression was primarily a failure on the part of free markets or a failure of government efforts to regulate interest rates, curtail widespread bank failures, and control the money supply.Current theories may be broadly classified into two main points of view and several heterodox points of view.<br/>9. There are demand-driven theories, most importantly Keynesian economics, but also including those who point to the breakdown of international trade, and Institutional economists who point to underconsumption and over-investment (causing an economic bubble), malfeasance by bankers and industrialists, or incompetence by government officials.<br/>10. The consensus among demand-driven theories is that a large-scale loss of confidence led to a sudden reduction in consumption and investment spending.<br/>11. Once panic and deflation set in, many people believed they could avoid further losses by keeping clear of the markets.<br/>12. Holding money became profitable as prices dropped lower and a given amount of money bought ever more goods, exacerbating the drop in demand.There are the monetarists, who believe that the Great Depression started as an ordinary recession, but that significant policy mistakes by monetary authorities (especially the Federal Reserve), caused a shrinking of the money supply which greatly exacerbated the economic situation, causing a recession to descend into the Great Depression.<br/>13. Related to this explanation are those who point to debt deflation causing those who borrow to owe ever more in real terms.There are also various heterodox theories that downplay or reject the explanations of the Keynesians and monetarists.<br/>14. For example, some new classical macroeconomists have argued that various labor market policies imposed at the start caused the length and severity of the Great Depression.<br/>15. The Austrian school of economics focuses on the macroeconomic effects of money supply, and how central banking decisions can lead to over-investment (economic bubble).<br/>",10,What does the consensus think led to a sudden reduction in consumption and investment spending?,,

In mammals, there are two broad types of stem cells: embryonic stem cells, which are isolated from the inner cell mass of blastocysts, and adult stem cells, which are found in various tissues.<br/>4.

In a developing embryo, stem cells can differentiate into all the specialized cells—ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm (see induced pluripotent stem cells)—but also maintain the normal turnover of regenerative organs, such as blood, skin, or intestinal tissues.There are three accessible sources of autologous adult stem cells in humans:<br/>6. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bone marrow, which requires extraction by ""harvesting"", that is, drilling into bone (typically the femur or iliac crest),<br/>7. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adipose tissue (lipid cells), which requires extraction by liposuction, and<br/>8. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blood, which requires extraction through apheresis, wherein blood is drawn from the donor (similar to a blood donation), and passed through a machine that extracts the stem cells and returns other portions of the blood to the donor.<br/><br/>9.

One reason that biological systems can be difficult to study is that so many different interactions with other organisms and the environment are possible, even on small scales.<br/>4. A microscopic bacterium in a local sugar gradient is responding to its environment as much as a lion searching for food in the African savanna.<br/>5.

In addition to being a major source of variation, mutation may also function as a mechanism of evolution when there are different probabilities at the molecular level for different mutations to occur, a process known as mutation bias.<br/>2. If two genotypes, for example one with the nucleotide G and another with the nucleotide A in the same position, have the same fitness, but mutation from G to A happens more often than mutation from A to G, then genotypes with A will tend to evolve.<br/>3. Different insertion vs. deletion mutation biases in different taxa can lead to the evolution of different genome sizes.<br/>4. Developmental or mutational biases have also been observed in morphological evolution.<br/>5. For example, according to the phenotype-first theory of evolution, mutations can eventually cause the genetic assimilation of traits that were previously induced by the environment.Mutation bias effects are superimposed on other processes.<br/>6. If selection would favor either one out of two mutations, but there is no extra advantage to having both, then the mutation that occurs the most frequently is the one that is most likely to become fixed in a population.<br/>7. Mutations leading to the loss of function of a gene are much more common than mutations that produce a new, fully functional gene.<br/>8. <strike>Most loss of function mutations are selected against.</strike><br/>9. But when selection is weak, mutation bias towards loss of function can affect evolution.<br/>10. For example, pigments are no longer useful when animals live in the darkness of caves, and tend to be lost.<br/>11. This kind of loss of function can occur because of mutation bias, and/or because the function had a cost, and once the benefit of the function disappeared, natural selection leads to the loss.<br/>12. Loss of sporulation ability in a bacterium during laboratory evolution appears to have been caused by mutation bias, rather than natural selection against the cost of maintaining sporulation ability.<br/>13. When there is no selection for loss of function, the speed at which loss evolves depends more on the mutation rate than it does on the effective population size, indicating that it is driven more by mutation bias than by genetic drift.<br/>",9,What happens what selection is weak?,,

Conjugation, in the much-studied E. coli system is determined by plasmid genes, and is an adaptation for transferring copies of the plasmid from one bacterial host to another.<br/>7. It is seldom that a conjugative plasmid integrates into the host bacterial chromosome, and subsequently transfers part of the host bacterial DNA to another bacterium.<br/>8. Plasmid-mediated transfer of host bacterial DNA also appears to be an accidental process rather than a bacterial adaptation.Transformation, unlike transduction or conjugation, depends on numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact to perform this complex process, and thus transformation is clearly a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer.<br/>9. In order for a bacterium to bind, take up and recombine donor DNA into its own chromosome, it must first enter a special physiological state termed competence (see Natural competence).<br/>10. In ""Bacillus subtilis"" about 40 genes are required for the development of competence.<br/>11. The length of DNA transferred during ""B. subtilis"" transformation can be between a third of a chromosome up to the whole chromosome.<br/>12. Transformation appears to be common among bacterial species, and thus far at least 60 species are known to have the natural ability to become competent for transformation.<br/>13. The development of competence in nature is usually associated with stressful environmental conditions, and seems to be an adaptation for facilitating repair of DNA damage in recipient cells.In ordinary circumstances, transduction, conjugation, and transformation involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria of the same species, but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences, such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance.<br/>14. In such cases, gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called horizontal gene transfer and may be common under natural conditions.<br/>15. <strike>Gene transfer is particularly important in antibiotic resistance as it allows the rapid transfer of resistance genes between different pathogens.</strike><br/>","1, 2",How many ways can some bacteria be transfered between cells?,,

These X-ray emissions are generally thought to be caused by one of the component stars being a compact object accreting matter from the other (regular) star.<br/>3. The presence of an ordinary star in such a system provides a unique opportunity for studying the central object and determining if it might be a black hole.If such a system emits signals that can be directly traced back to the compact object, it cannot be a black hole.<br/>4. The absence of such a signal does, however, not exclude the possibility that the compact object is a neutron star.<br/>5. By studying the companion star it is often possible to obtain the orbital parameters of the system and obtain an estimate for the mass of the compact object.<br/>6. If this is much larger than the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit (that is, the maximum mass a neutron star can have before collapsing) then the object cannot be a neutron star and is generally expected to be a black hole.The first strong candidate for a black hole, Cygnus X-1, was discovered in this way by Charles Thomas Bolton, Louise Webster and Paul Murdin in 1972.<br/>7. Some doubt, however, remained due to the uncertainties resultant from the companion star being much heavier than the candidate black hole.<br/>8. Currently, better candidates for black holes are found in a class of X-ray binaries called soft X-ray transients.<br/>9. In this class of system the companion star is relatively low mass allowing for more accurate estimates in the black hole mass.<br/>10. Moreover, these systems are only active in X-ray for several months once every 10–50 years.<br/>11.

Typically the aurora appears either as a diffuse glow or as ""curtains"" that approximately extend in the east-west direction.<br/>2. At some times, they form ""quiet arcs""; at others (""active aurora""), they evolve and change constantly.<br/>3. Each curtain consists of many parallel rays, each lined up with the local direction of the magnetic field lines, suggesting that auroras are shaped by Earth's magnetic field.<br/>4. Indeed, satellites show that electrons are guided by magnetic field lines, spiraling around them while moving toward Earth.The similarity to curtains is often enhanced by folds called ""striations"".<br/>5. When the field line guiding a bright auroral patch leads to a point directly above the observer, the aurora may appear as a ""corona"" of diverging rays, an effect of perspective.Although it was first mentioned by Ancient Greek explorer/geographer Pytheas, Hiorter and Celsius first described in 1741 evidence for magnetic control, namely, large magnetic fluctuations occurred whenever the aurora was observed overhead.<br/>6. This indicates (it was later realized) that large electric currents were associated with the aurora, flowing in the region where auroral light originated.<br/>7. Kristian Birkeland (1908) deduced that the currents flowed in the east-west directions along the auroral arc, and such currents, flowing from the dayside toward (approximately) midnight were later named ""auroral electrojets"" (see also Birkeland currents).Still more evidence for a magnetic connection are the statistics of auroral observations.<br/>8. <strike>Elias Loomis (1860) and later in more detail Hermann Fritz (1881) and S.

The instantaneous distribution of auroras (""auroral oval"") is slightly different, centered about 3–5 degrees nightward of the magnetic pole, so that auroral arcs reach furthest toward the equator about an hour before midnight.<br/>11. The aurora can be seen best at this time, called magnetic midnight, which occurs when an observer, the magnetic pole in question and the Sun are in alignment.In the 1970s, astrophysicist Joan Feynman deduced that auroras are a product of the interaction between the Earth's magnetosphere and the magnetic field of the solar wind.<br/>12. Her work resulted from data collected by the Explorer 33 spacecraft.On 26 February 2008, THEMIS probes were able to determine, for the first time, the triggering event for the onset of magnetospheric substorms.<br/>13. Two of the five probes, positioned approximately one third the distance to the moon, measured events suggesting a magnetic reconnection event 96 seconds prior to auroral intensification.<br/>14. Dr. Vassilis Angelopoulos of the University of California, Los Angeles, the principal investigator for the THEMIS mission, claimed, ""Our data show clearly and for the first time that magnetic reconnection is the trigger.""<br/>",1,Does the aurora typically extend from east-west or north-south?,,
