We_Are_Young-Composition_and_lyrical_interpretation,8,"Category: Music<br/>Title: We Are Young<br/>Section: Composition and lyrical interpretation<br/><br/>1. <br/>2. ""We Are Young"" is a power ballad that combines the genres of indie pop, alternative rock, and power pop.<br/>3. The song is written in the key of F major, based almost entirely on the 50s progression (I vi IV V) with the exception of its bridge, and follows a tempo of 116 beats per minute, changing to 92 bpm from the pre chorus to the end.<br/>4. The song has a slow hip hop groove from the first chorus onward, and the song in its entirety is in common time.<br/>5. The instrumentation of the original mix session consists of drums, bass guitar, synth bass, electric guitars, synths, piano, horns and other brass, and a hugh amount of vocal tracks, as well as the rough mix and two reference tracks, by Queen and Kanye West, that are both muted in the final master.In the song, ""careful arrangements layer sharp, bright piano melodies with big, booming drums and multiple vocal harmonies.""<br/>6. Ruess shifts from ""vulnerable verbal tumbling in the song's sonically sparse intro to the grandiose declaration, 'Tonight, we are young / So let's set the world on fire / We can burn brighter than the sun' in the massive chorus.""<br/>7. According to ""Spin"", the song incorporates a ""marrying fist-pump stadium rock to the prim indie-pop of Grizzly Bear's ""Two Weeks,"" keeping the deliberate beats and soaring melodies but replacing choirboy primness with a percussive whomp.""<br/>8. <strike>Andrew Unterberger of ""Popdust"" compared the song's chorus to that of Pat Benatar's ""Love Is a Battlefield"" and Supergrass' ""Alright,"" and noted that nearly every word in the chorus is imbued with maximum passion and importance.</strike><br/>9. Tim Jonze Guardian.co.uk described the chorus as anthemic and compared it to work done by Arcade Fire and stated that the lyrics were ""life-affirming and fit for a teen movie soundtrack.<br/>10. ""Lead singer Nate Ruess says the lyrics were inspired by one specific night, after ""my worst drinking night of all time.""<br/>11. Ruess told ""Rolling Stone"" that he was kicked out of a taxi cab for puking all over it.<br/>12. ""The cabbie was demanding all this money, and all I could do was stand on the corner with my head against the wall.<br/>13. It took me another day before I was a functioning adult and could actually write down the verses,"" he said.<br/>"
Payphone_(song)-Synopsis,4,"Category: Music<br/>Title: Payphone (song)<br/>Section: Synopsis<br/><br/>1. The video begins with a flashforward that starts with a beleaguered Levine torching his ride and dialing (possibly) his lost love's telephone number at a payphone.<br/>2. Another typical day at a Las Vegas (seen from the decals on the police cars) bank for Levine is shown next, which turns into chaos when some bandits enter and take charge (one of them is played by the band's lead guitarist – James Valentine – and some of the other bank robbers are probably played by drummer Matt Flynn, bassist Mickey Madden and current keyboardist, originally a touring-only band member, PJ Morton) – all of this happens while the song plays in the background.<br/>3. Levine grabs a gun from one of the robbers and threatens to get rid of them.<br/>4. <strike>He and his female co-worker (played by Dutch model Bregje Heinen) escape though Levine is shot in the arm, but when some cops mistake him for one of the robbers, Levine tells the female co-worker to hide in a car and steals an AC Cobra 427 that belongs to Wiz Khalifa to get away from them.</strike><br/>5. A car chase follows and when Levine is almost caught by the police, he steers the stolen convertible onto the wrong side of the road and causes a huge explosion, which destroys one of the police cars.<br/>6. When he finally reaches his destination in Los Angeles, he passes by a place where Wiz, the owner of the car, performed his rap earlier.<br/>7. After Levine gets out of the convertible, it also explodes and he enters a booth, injured, with the titular payphone, probably to call for help (It is also likely that he is calling Heinen) – this connects to the beginning of the video.<br/>"

Ann Powers of NPR felt that ""the artfulness of this music allows me an in to that experience.<br/>12. I can make that leap and identify with Drake, or at least be intrigued by multiple characters in the little dramas he designs.""<br/>13. Jon Caramanica of ""The New York Times"" called it ""an album of eccentric black pop that takes"" hip hop and R&B ""as starting points, asks what they can do but haven’t been doing, then attempts those things.<br/>14.

According to Katherine St Asaph of PopDust, the song was probably the closest to his and Colbie Caillat collaboration “Lucky.” She added that it was ""a gentle acoustic ballad with a hint of speak-singing a ways in but otherwise straightforward and straight-faced soft-rocks its way through sentiments like “when I look into your eyes, it’s like watching the night sky or a beautiful sunrise–there’s just so much they hold”–still earnest, but joke-free.""<br/>6. Amy Dawson of Metro UK called it ""a delicate, countrified guitar ballad that drives into a power-chorus singalong conclusion.""<br/>7. Colin McGuire of PopMatters was mixed in his review, writing that ""'I Won’t Give Up', for instance, is acoustic guitar-laden folky pop that falls at least a little bit flat with its predictably bland approach.<br/>8.

The show displays the growth of relationships between the doctors, either friendly or sexual, often stemming to a clash between their personal and professional lives.<br/>14. Emotional scenes are often accompanied by an indie rock background song, something that has become a hallmark of the series.<br/>15. At the conclusion of each episode, Meredith delivers another voice-over, typically contrasting or following up on her initial one.<br/>"

Dancing_with_the_Stars_(U.S._TV_series)-Success_of_athletes,21,"Category: Tv<br/>Title: Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)<br/>Section: Success of athletes<br/><br/>1. Athletes have historically been far more successful as a group than other celebrities on the show.<br/>2. At the end of the spring 2011 season, 28 athletes have competed on the show, representing 20% of the contestants.<br/>3. They've won six competitions and placed second four times; a collective success (win or runner-up) rate of 36%.<br/>4. In other words, better than one third of the athletes who have appeared on the show have finished either first or second.<br/>5. This is far better than the rate for reality-show contestants, supermodels, actors, politicians and other celebrities.<br/>6. Musicians/singers, at 27%, are the second most successful group.It is speculated by the cast and staff on the show as well as the athletes themselves, that they have several advantages in some key areas:<br/>7. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical ability – Many of the physical abilities associated with gifted athleticism such as strength, agility, quickness, balance, stamina and more generally, body control and muscle coordination, are also considered useful and advantageous qualities in competitive dancing.<br/>8. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training and coaching – Athletes are familiar with effective and efficient training techniques.<br/>9. Professional dancer Cheryl Burke states, ""They are used to being coached and they respond to criticism better than, say, actors"".<br/>10. Casting director Deena Katz says, ""They know their limits and don't overtrain like some others do"", and so they avoid injuries, which hamper many of the contestants.<br/>11. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competitive instinct – Successful athletes are competitive individuals and therefore comfortable in an environment which encourages ""bettering"" an opponent.<br/>12. In addition, they are familiar with performing under pressure and in some cases, thrive on it.<br/>13. Highly successful, elite athletes are capable of performing at their highest level when it is most important.<br/>14. They are able to focus and possibly even ""raise"" the quality of their performance during the biggest of competitions, whereas other contestants may falter under the same pressure.<br/><br/>15. There are disadvantages as well, particularly with the larger athletes such as football and basketball players.</br>16. Some of these athletes have difficulty making their over-sized frames look graceful on the dance floor.<br/>17. However, this can also be an advantage: since this struggle with their large size is often plainly apparent during their performances, voters will tend to give them more leeway in this area, while an actor or singer with known dance background or training may be held to a higher standard in the voters' minds.In every season finale in which an athlete was present, and was either tied for the top of the leader board or one point behind the leader said athlete went on to win the season.<br/>18. This has happened on five occasions:<br/>19. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Season 3: Emmitt Smith and Mario Lopez tied in the finale, with both scoring 89/90<br/>20. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Season 5: Helio Castroneves scored one point behind Mel B in the finale, scoring 84/90 to her 85/90 (Castroneves is the only, male, non-NFL player for this to occur to)<br/>21. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strike>Season 8: Shawn Johnson and Gilles Marini tied in the finale, with both scoring 88/90 (Johnson is the only female athlete for this to occur to)</strike><br/>22. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Season 12: Hines Ward and Chelsea Kane tied in the finale, with both scoring 89/90 (Kane, however, landed in third place)<br/>23. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Season 14: Donald Driver scored one point behind Katherine Jenkins in the finale, scoring 89/90 to her 90/90<br/>"

Ochs moved the newspaper's operations to a new skyscraper on 42nd Street at Longacre Square.</strike><br/>2. Ochs persuaded Mayor George B. McClellan, Jr. to construct a subway station there, and the area was renamed ""Times Square"" on April 8, 1904.<br/>3. Just three weeks later, the first electrified advertisement appeared on the side of a bank at the corner of 46th Street and Broadway.<br/>4. ""The New York Times"", according to Nolan, moved to more spacious offices west of the square in 1913.<br/>5. The old Times Building was later named the Allied Chemical Building.<br/>6. Now known simply as One Times Square, it is famed for the Times Square Ball drop on its roof every New Year's Eve.In 1913, the Lincoln Highway Association, headed by entrepreneur Carl G. Fisher, chose the intersection of 42nd Street and Broadway, at the southeast corner of Times Square, to be the Eastern Terminus of the Lincoln Highway, the first road across the United States, which originally spanned coast-to-coast through 13 states to its Western Terminus in Lincoln Park in San Francisco, California.As the growth in New York City continued, Times Square quickly became a cultural hub full of theaters, music halls, and upscale hotels.Celebrities such as Irving Berlin, Fred Astaire, and Charlie Chaplin were closely associated with Times Square in the 1910s and 1920s.<br/>7. During this period, the area was nicknamed ""The Tenderloin"" because it was supposedly the most desirable location in Manhattan.<br/>8. However, it was during this period that the area was besieged by crime and corruption, in the form of gambling and prostitution; one case that garnered huge attention was the arrest and subsequent execution of police officer Charles Becker.The general atmosphere changed with the onset of the Great Depression in the 1930s.<br/>9. Times Square acquired a reputation as a dangerous neighborhood in the following decades.<br/>10. From the 1960s to the early 1990s, the seediness of the area, especially due its go-go bars, sex shops, and adult theaters, became an infamous symbol of the city's decline.<br/>"
Las_Vegas_Strip-Boundaries,2,"Category: Travel<br/>Title: Las Vegas Strip<br/>Section: Boundaries<br/><br/>1. Historically, the casinos that were not in Downtown Las Vegas along Fremont Street were restricted to outside of the city limits on Las Vegas Boulevard.<br/>2. <strike>In 1959 the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign was constructed exactly outside of the city limits.</strike><br/>3. The sign is today about south of the southernmost entrance to Mandalay Bay (the southernmost casino).In the strictest sense, ""the Strip"" refers only to the stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard that is roughly between Sahara Avenue and Russell Road, a distance of .<br/>4. However, the term is often used to refer not only to the road but also to the various casinos and resorts that line the road, and even to properties which are not on the road but in proximity.<br/>5. Phrases such as ""Strip Area"", ""Resort Corridor"" or ""Resort District"" are sometimes used to indicate a larger geographical area, including properties or more away from Las Vegas Boulevard, such as the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino.The traditional definition considers the Strip's northern terminus as the now-defunct Sahara Casino, though travel guides typically extend it to include the Stratosphere, to the north.<br/>6. At one time, the southern end of the Strip was Tropicana Avenue, but continuing construction has extended this boundary to Russell Road.<br/>7. Mandalay Bay is located just north of Russell Road and is the southernmost resort considered to be on the Strip.Because of the number and size of the resorts, the Resort Corridor can be quite wide.<br/>8. Interstate 15 runs roughly parallel and to the west of Las Vegas Boulevard for the entire length of the Strip.<br/>9. Paradise Road runs to the east in a similar fashion, and ends at St. Louis Avenue.<br/>10. The eastern side of the Strip is bounded by McCarran International Airport south of Tropicana Avenue.<br/>11. North of this point, the Resort Corridor can be considered to extend as far east as Paradise Road, although some consider Koval Lane as a less inclusive boundary.<br/>12. Interstate 15 is sometimes considered the western edge of the Resort Corridor from Interstate 215 to Spring Mountain Road.<br/>13. North of this point, Industrial Road serves as the western edge.The famous Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign is located in the median just south of Russell Road, across from the now-demolished Klondike Hotel & Casino; another similar sign is in the median at the north end of the Strip near the intersection of East St. Louis and South Main Streets.Newer resorts such as South Point and the M Resort are on Las Vegas Boulevard South as distant as 8 miles south of the Welcome to Las Vegas sign.<br/>14.

When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced in 1901 that they planned to build a new union terminal, the city had two reasons to celebrate.<br/>2. The decision meant that both railroads would soon remove their trackwork and terminals from the National Mall.<br/>3. Though changes there appeared only gradually, the consolidation of the depots allowed the creation of the Mall as it appears today.<br/>4. <strike>Secondly, the plan to bring all the city's railroads under one roof promised that Washington would finally have a station both large enough to handle large crowds and impressive enough to befit the city's role as the federal capital.Union Station opened on October 27, 1907, with the arrival of a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad passenger train from Pittsburgh.</strike><br/>5. The terminal quickly became the portal to the Capitol.<br/>6. At no time was it busier than during World War II, when as many as 200,000 people passed through in a single day.For most of its existence, Union Station served as a hub, with service of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Pennsylvania Railroad, and Southern Railway.<br/>7. The Richmond, Fredericksburg & Potomac Railroad provided a link to Richmond, Virginia, about to the south, where major north-south lines of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad and Seaboard Air Line Railroad provided service to the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida.<br/>"

As a result of the Redevelopment Act of 1981, Union Station was closed for restoration and refurbishing.<br/>2. Mold was growing in the leaking ceiling of the Main Hall, and the carpet laid out for an Inauguration Day celebration was full of cigarette-burned holes.<br/>3. In 1988, Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Dole awarded $70 million to the restoration effort.<br/>4. ""The Pit"" was transformed into a new basement level, and the Main Hall floor was refitted with marble.<br/>5. While installing new HVAC systems, crews discovered antique items in shafts that had not been opened since the building's creation.The station reopened in its present form on September 29, 1988.<br/>6. <strike>The former “Pit” area was replaced with an AMC movie theater (later Phoenix Theatres), closed October 12, 2009, to be replaced with additional restaurants and a large food court in the former baggage-mail level.</strike><br/>7.

A variety of shops opened along the Concourse and Main Hall, and a new Amtrak terminal at the back behind the original Concourse.<br/>9. Trains no longer enter the original Concourse but the original, decorative gates were relocated to the new passenger concourse.<br/>10. In 1994, this new passenger concourse was renamed to honor W. Graham Claytor, Jr., who served as Amtrak's president from 1982 to 1993.<br/>11. The decorative elements of the station were also restored.<br/>12.

Central_Park-1857–1900,8,"Category: Travel<br/>Title: Central Park<br/>Section: 1857–1900<br/><br/>1. History.1857–1900.Central Park was not a part of the Commissioners' Plan of 1811; however, between 1821 and 1855, New York City nearly quadrupled in population.<br/>2. Since it was not part of the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, John Randel, Jr., surveyed the park and the only remaining surveying bolt from his survey is still visible.<br/>3. The bolt is in a rock just north of the Dairy and the 65th Street Transverse and south of Center Drive.<br/>4. As the city expanded, people were drawn to the few existing open spaces, mainly cemeteries, to get away from the noise and chaotic life in the city.New York City's need for a great public park was voiced by the poet and editor of the ""Evening Post"" (now the ""New York Post""), William Cullen Bryant, and by the first American landscape architect, Andrew Jackson Downing, who began to publicize the city's need for a public park in 1844.<br/>5. A stylish place for open-air driving, similar to the Bois de Boulogne in Paris or London's Hyde Park, was felt to be needed by many influential New Yorkers, and, after an abortive attempt in 1850-51 to designate Jones's Wood, in 1853 the New York legislature settled upon a area from 59th to 106th Streets for the creation of the park, at a cost of more than US$5 million for the land alone.The state appointed a Central Park Commission to oversee the development of the park, and in 1857 the commission held a landscape design contest.<br/>6. Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux developed what came to be known as the ""Greensward Plan"", which was selected as the winning design.According to Olmsted, the park was """"of great importance as the first real Park made in this country—a democratic development of the highest significance…,"""" a view probably inspired by his stay and various trips in Europe during 1850.He visited several parks during these trips and was particularly impressed by Birkenhead Park and Derby Arboretum in England.Several influences came together in the design.<br/>7. Landscaped cemeteries, such as Mount Auburn (Cambridge, Massachusetts) and Green-Wood (Brooklyn, New York) had set examples of idyllic, naturalistic landscapes.<br/>8. <strike>The most influential innovations in the Central Park design were the ""separate circulation"" systems for pedestrians, horseback riders, and pleasure vehicles.</strike><br/>9. The ""crosstown"" commercial traffic was entirely concealed in sunken roadways, (today called ""transverses""), screened with densely planted shrub belts so as to maintain a rustic ambiance.The Greensward plan called for some 36 bridges, all designed by Vaux, ranging from rugged spans of Manhattan schist or granite, to lacy neo-gothic cast iron; no two are alike.<br/>10. The ensemble of the formal line of the Mall's doubled allées of elms culminating at Bethesda Terrace, whose centerpiece is the Bethesda Fountain, with a composed view beyond of lake and woodland, was at the heart of the larger design.Execution of the ""Greensward Plan"" was the responsibility of a number of individuals, including Jacob Wrey Mould (architect), Ignaz Anton Pilat (master gardener), George Waring (engineer), and Andrew Haswell Green (politician), in addition to Olmsted and Vaux.Before the construction of the park could start, the area had to be cleared of its inhabitants,most of whom were quite poor and either free African Americans or residents of English or Irish origin.<br/>11. Most of them lived in small villages, such as Seneca Village, Harsenville, or the Piggery District; or in the school and convent at Mount St. Vincent's Academy.<br/>12. Around 1,600 residents occupying the area at the time, were evicted under the rule of eminent domain during 1857.<br/>13. Seneca Village and parts of the other communities were razed to make room for the park.During the construction of the park, Olmsted fought constant battles with the park commissioners, many of whom were appointees of the city's Democratic machine.<br/>14. In 1860, he was forced out for the first of many times as Central Park's superintendent, and Andrew Haswell Green, the former president of New York City's board of education took over as the chairman of the commission.<br/>15. Despite the fact that he had relatively little experience, he still managed to accelerate the construction, as well as to finalize the negotiations for the purchase of an additional at the north end of the park, between 106th and 110th Streets, which would be used as the ""rugged"" part of the park, its swampy northeast corner dredged, and reconstructed as the Harlem Meer.Between 1860 and 1873, most of the major hurdles to construction were overcome, and the park was substantially completed.<br/>16. Construction combined the modern with the ageless: up-to-date steam-powered equipment and custom-designed wheeled tree moving machines augmented massive numbers of unskilled laborers wielding shovels.<br/>17. The work was extensively documented with technical drawings and photographs.<br/>18. During this period, more than 18,500 cubic yards (14,000 m³) of topsoil had been transported in from New Jersey, because the original soil was not fertile or substantial enough to sustain the various trees, shrubs, and plants called for by the Greensward Plan.<br/>19. When the park was officially completed in 1873, more than ten million cartloads of material had been transported out of the park, including soil and rocks.<br/>20. More than four million trees, shrubs and plants representing approximately 1,500 species were transplanted to the park.More gunpowder was used to clear the area than was used at the battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War.Sheep grazed on the Sheep Meadow from the 1860s until 1934, when they were moved to Prospect Park in Brooklyn,and were soon moved to a farm near Otisville, New York as it was feared they would be used for food by impoverished Depression-era New Yorkers.<br/>21.

Central_Park-1900–1960,2,"Category: Travel<br/>Title: Central Park<br/>Section: 1900–1960<br/><br/>1. Following completion, the park quickly slipped into decline.<br/>2. <strike>One of the main reasons for this was the lack of interest of the Tammany Hall political machine, which was the largest political force in New York at the time.Around the turn of the 20th century, the park faced several new challenges.</strike><br/>3. Cars were becoming commonplace, bringing with them their burden of pollution, and people's attitudes were beginning to change.<br/>4. No longer were parks to be used only for walks and picnics in an idyllic environment, but now also for sports, and similar recreation.<br/>5. Following the dissolution of the Central Park Commission in 1870 and Andrew Green's departure from the project, and the death of Vaux in 1895, the maintenance effort gradually declined, and there were few, if any, attempts to replace dead trees, bushes and plants, or worn-out lawn.<br/>6. For several decades, authorities did little or nothing to prevent vandalism and the littering of the park.All of this changed in 1934, when Republican Fiorello La Guardia was elected mayor of New York City and unified the five park-related departments then in existence.<br/>7. Robert Moses was given the task of cleaning up the park.<br/>8. Moses, about to become one of the mightiest men in New York City, took over what was essentially a relic, a leftover from a bygone era.According to historian Robert Caro in his 1974 book ""The Power Broker"":<br/>9. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Lawns, unseeded, were expanses of bare earth, decorated with scraggly patches of grass and weeds, that became dust holes in dry weather and mud holes in wet….<br/>10. The once beautiful Mall looked like a scene of a wild party the morning after.<br/>11. Benches lay on their backs, their legs jabbing at the sky...""<br/><br/>12. In a single year, Moses managed to clean up Central Park and other parks in New York City.</br>13. Lawns and flowers were replanted, dead trees and bushes were replaced, walls were sandblasted, and bridges repaired.<br/>14. Another dramatic change was Moses's removal of the ""Hoover Valley"" shantytown, whose site was transformed into the Great Lawn.Major redesigning and construction also was carried out: for instance, the Croton Lower Reservoir was filled in so the Great Lawn could be created.<br/>15. The Greensward Plan's purpose of creating an idyllic landscape was combined with Moses' vision of a park to be used for recreational purposes—19 playgrounds, 12 ball fields, and handball courts were constructed.<br/>16. Moses also managed to secure funds from the New Deal program, as well as donations from the public.<br/>"

Reed & Stem were responsible for the overall design of the station, Warren and Wetmore added architectural details and the Beaux-Arts style.<br/>3. Charles Reed was appointed the chief executive for the collaboration between the two firms, and promptly appointed Alfred T. Fellheimer as head of the combined design team.<br/>4. This work was accompanied by the ""electrification"" of the three railroads using the station and the burial of the approach in the Park Avenue tunnel.<br/>5. The result of this was the creation of several blocks worth of prime real estate in Manhattan, which were then sold for a large sum of money.<br/>6.

The construction of Grand Central created a mini-city within New York, including the Commodore Hotel and various office buildings.<br/>2. It spurred construction throughout the neighborhood in the 1920s including the Chrysler Building.In 1928, the New York Central built its headquarters in a 34-story building (now called the Helmsley Building) straddling Park Avenue on the north side of the Terminal.There is a ""secret"" platform, number 61, under the station.<br/>3. This was once used to convey President Franklin D. Roosevelt directly into the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.<br/>4. This platform was part of the original design of the Waldorf Astoria.<br/>5. It was mentioned in ""The New York Times"" in 1929 but was first used by General Pershing in 1938.From 1939 to 1964 CBS Television occupied a large portion of the terminal building, particularly above the main waiting room.<br/>6. The space contained two production studios (41 and 42), two ""program control"" facilities (43 and 44), network master control, and facilities for local station WCBS-TV.<br/>7. In 1958, the first major videotape operations facility in the world opened in a former rehearsal room on the seventh floor of the main terminal building.<br/>8. The facility used fourteen Ampex VR-1000 videotape recorders.<br/>9. <strike>The ""CBS Evening News"" began its broadcasts there with Douglas Edwards.</strike><br/>10. Many historic news events were broadcast from this location, such as John Glenn's Mercury-Atlas 6 space mission and Walter Cronkite's coverage of the assassination of John F. Kennedy.<br/>11. Edward R. Murrow's ""See It Now"" originated from Grand Central, including his famous broadcasts on Senator Joseph McCarthy.<br/>12. The Murrow broadcasts were recreated in George Clooney's movie ""Good Night, and Good Luck"", although the CBS News and corporate offices were not actually in the same building as the film implies.<br/>13. The long-running panel show ""What's My Line?""<br/>14. was first broadcast from the GCT studios, as were ""The Goldbergs"" and ""Mama"".<br/>15. The facility's operations were later moved to the CBS Broadcast Center.<br/>16.

"Magic_Kingdom-Main_Street,_U.S.A.",16,"Category: Travel<br/>Title: Magic Kingdom<br/>Section: Main Street, U.S.A.<br/><br/>1. Symbolically, Main Street, U.S.A. represents the park's ""opening credits,"" where guests pass under the train station (the opening curtain,) then view the names of key personnel along the windows of the buildings' upper floors.<br/>2. Many windows bear the name of a fictional business, such as ""Seven Summits Expeditions, Frank G. Wells President"", with each representing a tribute to significant people connected to the Disney company and the development of the Walt Disney World Resort.<br/>3. It features stylistic influences from around the country.<br/>4. Taking its inspiration from New England to Missouri, this design is most noticeable in the four corners in the middle of Main Street, where each of the four corner buildings represents a different architectural style.<br/>5. There is no opera house as there is at Disneyland; instead, there is the Town Square Theater.<br/>6. Also, this is where Christopher George Weaver, the ""mayor"" of Main Street U.S.A., and one of the park's most important figures, resides.Main Street is lined with shops selling merchandise and food.<br/>7. The decor is early-20th century small-town America, inspired by Walt Disney's childhood and the film ""Lady and the Tramp"".<br/>8. City Hall contains the Guest Relations lobby, where cast members provide information and assistance.<br/>9. A working barber shop gives haircuts for a fee.<br/>10. The Emporium carries a wide variety of Disney souvenirs such as plush toys, collectible pins and Mickey-ear hats.<br/>11. Tony’s Town Square Restaurant and The Plaza Restaurant are table-service locations.<br/>12. At the end of Main Street is Casey's Corner, where guests enjoy traditional American ballpark fare including hot dogs and fries while watching old cartoons on the bleachers.<br/>13. The Main Street Confectionary sells sweets priced by their weight, such as candied apples, crisped rice treats, chocolates, cookies and fudge.<br/>14. Most windows bear the name of people who were influential at Disney parks.<br/>15. An example of a classic Main Street, U.S.A. attraction is the narrow gauge Walt Disney World Railroad, which transports guest throughout the park, making stops at Main Street, U.S.A., Fantasyland, and Frontierland.<br/>16. <strike>The railroad's previous stop at Mickey's Toontown Fair was replaced by the Fantasyland stop in 2012.</strike><br/>17. Main Street, U.S.A. also has the Main Street Vehicles attraction, which includes a narrow gauge tramway with horse-drawn streetcars, and several old-fashioned motor vehicles.In the distance beyond the end of Main Street stands Cinderella Castle.<br/>18. Though only 189 feet (55m) tall, it benefits from a technique known as forced perspective.<br/>19. The second stories of all the buildings along Main Street are shorter than the first stories, and the third stories are even shorter than the second, and the top windows of the castle are much smaller than they appear.<br/>20. The resulting visual effect is that the buildings appear to be larger and taller than they really are.The park contains two additional tributes: the ""Partners"" statue of Walt Disney and Mickey Mouse in front of Cinderella Castle and the ""Sharing the Magic"" statue of Roy O. Disney sitting with Minnie Mouse in the Town Square section of Main Street, U.S.A.<br/>21. Both were sculpted by veteran Imagineer Blaine Gibson.<br/>22.

I took notes and had no problem filling a book with all the ideas that this concept offered, even on first blush.<br/>4. ""Marc Abraham and Eric Newman of Strike Entertainment were scheduled to produce the film.<br/>5. Writer-producer Ronald D. Moore had previously written an original script for the project, which the studio eventually declined to use, stating that Favreau and a new screenwriter would develop a new script.<br/>6. <strike>On June 20, 2011, novelist Michael Chabon signed on to write the film's script.</strike><br/>"

These walls served as both defensive walls and retaining walls for the palace.<br/>4. They were constructed with a rammed earth core, and surfaced with three layers of specially baked bricks on both sides, with the interstices filled with mortar.At the four corners of the wall sit towers (E) with intricate roofs boasting 72 ridges, reproducing the Pavilion of Prince Teng and the Yellow Crane Pavilion as they appeared in Song dynasty paintings.<br/>5. These towers are the most visible parts of the palace to commoners outside the walls, and much folklore is attached to them.<br/>6. According to one legend, artisans could not put a corner tower back together after it was dismantled for renovations in the early Qing dynasty, and it was only rebuilt after the intervention of carpenter-immortal Lu Ban.The wall is pierced by a gate on each side.<br/>7. At the southern end is the main Meridian Gate (A).<br/>8. To the north is the Gate of Divine Might (B), which faces Jingshan Park.<br/>9. <strike>The east and west gates are called the ""East Glorious Gate"" (D) and ""West Glorious Gate"" (C).</strike><br/>10.

The gate has five gateways.<br/>12. The central gateway is part of the Imperial Way, a stone flagged path that forms the central axis of the Forbidden City and the ancient city of Beijing itself, and leads all the way from the Gate of China in the south to Jingshan in the north.<br/>13.

The Forbidden City, the culmination of the two-thousand-year development of classical Chinese and East Asian architecture, has been influential in the subsequent development of Chinese architecture, as well as providing inspiration for many artistic works.<br/>2. Some specific examples include:<br/>3. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depiction in art, film, literature and popular culture<br/><br/>4. The Forbidden City has served as the scene to many works of fiction.</br>5. In recent years, it has been depicted in films and television series.<br/>6.

The sunlight in Bedesten comes from rectangular windows placed right under the roof: they can be accessed through a wooden ambulatory.<br/>6. Due to the scarce illumination, the edifice was kept open only some hours each day, and was devoted to the trade of luxury goods, above all textiles.<br/>7. Moreover, the Bedesten's Mahzen were also used as safes.<br/>8. The building can be accessed through four gates: <br/>9. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Second-hand Book Sellers’ Gate” () in the north, <br/>10. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Skullcap Sellers’ Gate” () in the south,<br/>11. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Jewellers’ Gate” () in the east, and;<br/>12. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Women’s Clothiers’ Gate” () in the west.<br/><br/>13.

Both buildings were closed by Iron gates.Aside the Bedesten, originally the Grand Bazaar structures were built with wood, and only after the 1700 fire, they were rebuilt in stone and brickwork, and covered.<br/>17. All the bazaar edifices, except the fur dealers market (), a later addition which is two-story, are one story.<br/>18. The roofs are mainly covered with tiles, while the part burnt in 1954 uses now tarmac.<br/>19. In the bazaar no artificial light was foreseen, also to prevent fires, and smoking was strictly prohibited.<br/>20. The roads outside the inner Bedesten are roughly parallel to it.<br/>21.

This project should finally solve the big problems of the market: for example, in the whole Bazaar there is no proper toilet facility.<br/>7. Moreover, the lacks of controls in the past years allowed many dealers to remove columns and skive walls in their shops to gain space: This, together with the substitution of lead (stolen in the last years) with concrete on the market's roof, has created a great hazard when the earthquake expected in Istanbul in the next years will occur.The Grand Bazaar is opened each day except Sundays and bank holidays from 9:00 until 19:00.<br/>"

By 1994, over 140 million people had entered through the gates of Tokyo Disneyland (the population of Japan is only 127.6 million) and the popularity has only increased.<br/>3. Just two years later, it employed 12,390 people, marking Disneyland Tokyo as the biggest workplace in Japan’s diversionary outings.<br/>4. Though the attendance is similar to that of other Japanese theme parks, the revenue produced by Tokyo Disney is larger than all other national theme parks combined, thus greatly profiting the Japanese economy.<br/>5. Many speculate that Disney Tokyo is such an economic success due to timing and location; the theme park lies in a metropolitan area with a population of 30 million and opened at the height of a booming economy where hard-working citizens desired a fun escape from reality.<br/>6. One of the main goals of Tokyo Japan is to ever improve the park and grow away from the restrictions of American Disney.<br/>7. Recently Japan has been merging their national identity with the Disneyland Park by adding attractions with distinctly Japanese qualities.<br/>8. Cinderella Castle displays the classic Disney character and story plot yet presents the story through the eyes of the Japanese.<br/>9. Meet the World, located in World Bazaar, shows true national identity and pride as it embodies Japanese history; instead of classic Disney characters, Meet the world characters wear the traditional Japanese Kimono.<br/>10. Once nominated by Disney Legends, Masatomo Takahashi, the former president of The Oriental Land Company, states this growth and development as one as their primary goals: “We must not just repeat what we receive from Disney.<br/>11.

It is located in the Streeterville neighborhood of the Near North Side community area.<br/>3. <strike>The pier was built in 1916 at a cost of $4.5 million.</strike><br/>4. It was a part of the Plan of Chicago developed by architect and city planner Daniel Burnham and his associates.<br/>5. As Municipal Pier #2 (Municipal Pier #1 was never built), Navy Pier was planned and built to serve as a mixed-purpose piece of public infrastructure.<br/>6. Its primary purpose was as a cargo facility for lake freighters, and warehouses were built up and down the Pier.<br/>7. However, the Pier was also designed to provide docking space for passenger excursion steamers, and in the pre–air conditioning era parts of the Pier, especially its outermost tip, were designed to serve as cool places for public gathering and entertainment.<br/>8.

Palace_of_Versailles-History,9,"Category: Travel<br/>Title: Palace of Versailles<br/>Section: History<br/><br/>1. The earliest mention of the name of Versailles is in a document dated 1038, relating to the village of Versailles.<br/>2. In 1575, the seigneury of Versailles was bought by Albert de Gondi, a naturalized Florentine, who invited Louis XIII on several hunting trips in the forests surrounding Versailles.<br/>3. Pleased with the location, Louis ordered the construction of a hunting lodge in 1624.<br/>4. Eight years later, Louis obtained the seigneury of Versailles from the Gondi family and began to make enlargements to the château.<br/>5. This structure would become the core of the new palace.<br/>6. Louis XIII's successor, Louis XIV, had it expanded into one of the largest palaces in the world.<br/>7. Following the Treaties of Nijmegen in 1678, he began to gradually move the court to Versailles.<br/>8. The court was officially established there on 6 May 1682.After the disgrace of Nicolas Fouquet in 1661, Louis confiscated Fouquet's estate and employed the talents of Le Vau, Le Nôtre, and Le Brun, who all had worked on Fouquet's grand château Vaux-le-Vicomte, for his building campaigns at Versailles and elsewhere.<br/>9. <strike>For Versailles, there were four distinct building campaigns.</strike><br/>"
Palace_of_Versailles-Costs_of_restoration_programmes,2,"Category: Travel<br/>Title: Palace of Versailles<br/>Section: Costs of restoration programmes<br/><br/>1. The restoration initiatives launched by the Fifth Republic have proven to be perhaps more costly than the expenditures of the palace in the Ancien Régime.<br/>2. <strike>Starting in the 1950s, when the museum of Versailles was under the directorship of Gérald van der Kemp, the objective was to restore the palace to its state – or as close to it as possible – in 1789 when the royal family left the palace.</strike><br/>3. Among the early projects was the repair of the roof over the Hall of Mirrors; the publicity campaign brought international attention to the plight of post-war Versailles and garnered much foreign money including a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation.<br/>4. Concurrently, in Russia, the restoration of the Pavlovsk Palace located outside of Leningrad – today's Saint Petersburg – brought the attention of French museum authorities, including the curators of Versailles (Massie, 1990).Pavlovsk Palace was built by Catherine the Great's son Paul.<br/>5. The czarevitch and his wife, Marie Feodorovna, were avid francophiles, who, on a visit to France and Versailles in the 1780s, purchased great quantities of silk, which they later used to upholster furniture in Pavlosk.<br/>6. The palace survived the Russian Revolution intact – descendants of Paul I were living in the palace at the time the communists evicted them – however, during the Second World War, the furniture and artifacts housed in the palace, which had been transformed into a museum, were removed.<br/>7. In the process of evacuation the museum collections, remnants of the silks purchased by Paul I of Russia and Marie Feodorovna were found and conserved.<br/>8. After the war when Soviet authorities were restoring the palace, which had been gutted by the retreating Nazi forces, they recreated the silk fabrics by using the conserved 18th century remnants (Massie, 1990).When the French authorities saw the results of Russian efforts and the high quality they were able to achieve, the French revived 18th-century weaving techniques so as to reproduce the silks used in the decoration of Versailles (Massie, 1990).<br/>9. The two greatest achievements of this initiative are seen today in wall hangings used in the restoration of the ""chambre de la reine"" in the ""grand appartement de reine"" and the ""chambre du roi"" in the ""appartement du roi"".<br/>10. While the design used for the ""chambre du roi"" was, in fact, from a design that had been used during the ""Ancien Régime"" to decorate the ""chambre de la reine"", it nevertheless represents a great achievement in the on-going restoration at Versailles.<br/>11. Additionally, this project, which took over seven years to achieve, required several hundred kilograms of silver and gold to complete (Meyer, 1989).<br/>12. One of the more costly endeavors for the museum and the government of France's Fifth Republic has been to repurchase as much of the original furnishings as possible.<br/>13. However, because furniture with a royal provenance – and especially furniture that was made for Versailles – is a highly sought after commodity on the international market, the museum has spent considerable funds on retrieving much of the palace's original furnishings (Kemp, 1976).In 2003, a new restoration initiative – the ""Grand Versailles"" project – was started, which necessitated unexpected repair and replantation of the gardens.<br/>14. The project will be on-going for the next seventeen years, funded with a state endowment of €135 million allocated for the first seven years.<br/>15. The project will address such concerns as security for the palace, and continued restoration of the ""bosquet des trois fontaines"".<br/>16. VINCI underwrote the €12 million restoration project for the Hall of Mirrors, which was completed in 2006 (Leloup, 2006).We may never know the true amount spent on the creation of Versailles, and most current estimates are speculative.<br/>17. A recent estimate has placed the amount spent on Versailles during the ""Ancien régime"" as US$2 billion (Littell, 2000).<br/>18. This figure in all probability is an under-evaluation of the money spent on Versailles.<br/>19. France's Fifth Republic expenditures alone that have been directed to restoration and maintenance at Versailles undoubtedly surpass those of the Sun King.<br/>"

The north and south side chambers contain carved inscriptions of Lincoln's second inaugural address and his Gettysburg Address.<br/>5. Bordering these inscriptions are pilasters ornamented with fasces, eagles, and wreaths.<br/>6. The inscriptions and adjoining ornamentation were done by Evelyn Beatrice Longman.The Memorial is filled with symbolism: the 36 columns represent the states in the union at the time of Lincoln's death, the 48 stone festoons on the attic above the columns represent the 48 states in 1922.<br/>7. Above each of the inscriptions is a mural painted by Jules Guerin graphically portraying governing principles evident in Lincoln's life.<br/>8. On the south wall mural, Freedom, Liberty, Immortality, Justice, and the Law are pictured, while the north wall portrays Unity, Fraternity, and Charity.<br/>9. Both scenes contain a background of cypress trees, the emblem of Eternity.<br/>10. The murals were crafted with a special mixture of paint which included elements of kerosene and wax to protect the exposed artwork from fluctuations in temperature and moisture conditions.The ceiling of the Memorial, above the floor, is composed of bronze girders, ornamented with laurel and oak leaves.<br/>11. Between the girders are panels of Alabama marble, saturated with paraffin to increase their translucency.<br/>12. Despite the increased light from this device, Bacon and French felt the statue required even more light.<br/>13. They decided upon an artificial lighting system in which a louvered lighting panel would be set in the ceiling with metal slats to conceal the great floodlights.<br/>14. Custodians could adjust the lights from a control room, varying them according to the outside light.<br/>15. Funds for this expensive system were appropriated by Congress in 1926, and in 1929, seven years after the dedication, the statue was properly lighted.<br/>16.

The museum was originally called the National Air Museum when formed on August 12, 1946 by an act of Congress and signed into law by President Harry S. Truman.<br/>2. Some pieces in the National Air and Space Museum collection date back to the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia after which the Chinese Imperial Commission donated a group of kites to the Smithsonian after Smithsonian Secretary Spencer Fullerton Baird convinced exhibiters that shipping them home would be too costly.<br/>3. The Stringfellow steam engine intended for aircraft was added to the collection in 1889, the first piece actively acquired by the Smithsonian now in the current NASM collection.After the establishment of the museum, there was no one building that could hold all the items to be displayed, many obtained from the United States Army and United States Navy collections of domestic and captured aircraft from World War I.<br/>4. Some pieces were on display in the Arts and Industries Building, some were stored in the Aircraft Building (also known as the ""Tin Shed""), a large temporary metal shed in the Smithsonian Castle's south yard.<br/>5. <strike>Larger missiles and rockets were displayed outdoors in what was known as Rocket Row.</strike><br/>6. The shed housed at large Martin bomber, a LePere fighter-bomber, and an Aeromarine 39B floatplane.<br/>7. Still, much of the collection remained in storage due to a lack of display space.The combination of the large numbers of aircraft donated to the Smithsonian after World War II and the need for hangar and factory space for the Korean War drove the Smithsonian to look for its own facility to store and restore aircraft.<br/>8. The current Garber Facility was ceded to the Smithsonian by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission in 1952 after the curator Paul E. Garber spotted the wooded area from the air.<br/>9. Bulldozers from Fort Belvoir and prefabricated buildings from the United States Navy kept the initial costs low.The space race in the 1950s and 1960s led to the renaming of the museum to the National Air and Space Museum, and finally congressional passage of appropriations for the construction of the new exhibition hall, which opened July 1, 1976 at the height of the United States Bicentennial festivities under the leadership of Director Michael Collins, who had flown to the Moon on Apollo 11.<br/>10. The Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center opened in 2003, funded by a private donation.The museum received COSTAR, the corrective optics instrument installed in the Hubble Space Telescope during its first servicing mission (STS-61), when it was removed and returned to Earth after Space Shuttle mission STS-125.<br/>11. The museum also holds the backup mirror for the Hubble which, unlike the one that was launched, was ground to the correct shape.<br/>12. There were once plans for it to be installed to the Hubble itself, but plans to return the satellite to Earth were scrapped after the Space Shuttle ""Columbia"" disaster in 2003; the mission was re-considered as too risky.The Smithsonian has also been promised the International Cometary Explorer, which is currently in a solar orbit that occasionally brings it back to Earth, should NASA attempt to recover it.<br/>"

This limited development of the Peak until the opening of the Peak Tram funicular in 1888.The boost to accessibility caused by the opening of the Peak Tram created demand for residences on the Peak.<br/>6. Between 1904 and 1930, the Peak Reservation Ordinance designated the Peak as an exclusive residential area reserved for non-Chinese.<br/>7.

The viewing deck also has coin operated telescopes that the visitors can use to enjoy the cityscape.<br/>4. The number of visitors led to the construction of two major leisure and shopping centres, the Peak Tower and the Peak Galleria, situated adjacent to each other.<br/>5. The Peak Tower incorporates the upper station of the Peak Tram, the funicular railway that brings passengers up from the St. John's Cathedral in Hong Kong's Central district, whilst the Peak Galleria incorporates the bus station used by the Hong Kong public buses and green minibuses on the Peak.<br/>6. The Peak is also accessible by taxi and private car via the circuitous Peak Road, or by walking up the steep Old Peak Road from near the Zoological Botanical Gardens.Victoria Peak Garden is located on the site of Mountain Lodge, the Governor's old summer residence, and is the closest publicly accessible point to the summit.<br/>7. It can be reached from Victoria Gap by walking up Mount Austin Road, a climb of about .<br/>8. Another popular walk is the level loop along Lugard Road, giving good views of Hong Kong's Central district and Kowloon, and then returning via Harlech Road, encircling the summit at the level of the Peak Tower.There are several restaurants on Victoria Peak, most of which are located in the two shopping centres.<br/>9. <strike>However, the Peak Lookout Restaurant, is housed in an older and more traditional building which was originally a spacious house for engineers working on the Peak Tramway.</strike><br/>10.

Situated on Bennelong Point in Sydney Harbour, close to the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the facility is adjacent to the Sydney central business district and the Royal Botanic Gardens, between Sydney and Farm Coves.Designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon, the facility formally opened on 20 October 1973 after a gestation beginning with Utzon's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition.<br/>3. The NSW Government, led by Premier Joseph Cahill, authorised work to begin in 1958, with Utzon directing construction.<br/>4. The government's decision to build Utzon's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect's ultimate resignation.Though its name suggests a single venue, the project comprises multiple performance venues which together are among the busiest performing arts centres in the world — hosting over 1,500 performances each year attended by some 1.2 million people.<br/>5. <strike>The venues produce and present a wide range of in-house productions and accommodate numerous performing arts companies, including four key resident companies: Opera Australia, The Australian Ballet, the Sydney Theatre Company and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.</strike><br/>6.

Elevations in the park range from at the mouth of Abrams Creek to at the summit of Clingmans Dome.<br/>2. Within the park a total of sixteen mountains reach higher than 6,000 feet (1829 m).The wide range of elevations mimics the latitudinal changes found throughout the entire eastern United States.<br/>3. Indeed, ascending the mountains is comparable to a trip from Tennessee to Canada.<br/>4. Plants and animals common in the country's Northeast have found suitable ecological niches in the park's higher elevations, while southern species find homes in the balmier lower reaches.During the most recent ice age, the northeast-to-southwest orientation of the Appalachian mountains allowed species to migrate southward along the slopes rather than finding the mountains to be a barrier.<br/>5. As climate warms, many northern species are now retreating upward along the slopes and withdrawing northward, while southern species are expanding.The park normally has very high humidity and precipitation, averaging from 55 inches (1,400 mm) per year in the valleys to 85 inches (2,200 mm) per year on the peaks.<br/>6. This is more annual rainfall than anywhere in the United States outside the Pacific Northwest and parts of Alaska and Hawaii.<br/>7. It is also generally cooler than the lower elevations below, and most of the park has a humid continental climate more comparable to locations much farther north, as opposed to the humid subtropical climate in the lowlands.<br/>8. The park is almost 95 percent forested, and almost 36 percent of it, , is estimated by the Park Service to be old growth forest with many trees that predate European settlement of the area.<br/>9. It is one of the largest blocks of deciduous, temperate, old growth forest in North America.The variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of biota.<br/>10. <strike>About 10,000 species of plants and animals are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 90,000 undocumented species may also be present.Park officials count more than 200 species of birds, 66 species of mammals, 50 species of fish, 39 species of reptiles, and 43 species of amphibians, including many lungless salamanders.</strike><br/>11.

Two yellow books as well as the purple medicinal herb foxglove are displayed on the table.<br/>3. The foxglove in the painting is a plant from which digitalis is extracted for the treatment of certain heart complaints, perhaps an attribute of Gachet as a doctor.The doctor's ""sensitive face"", which Van Gogh famously wrote to Paul Gauguin carried ""the heartbroken expression of our time"", is described by Robert Wallace as the portrait's focus.<br/>4. Wallace described the ultramarine blue coat of Gachet, set against a background of hills painted a lighter blue, as highlighting the ""tired, pale features and transparent blue eyes that reflect the compassion and melancholy of the man.""<br/>5. Van Gogh himself claimed this expression of melancholy ""would seem to look like a grimace to many who saw the canvas"".With the ""Portrait of Dr. Gachet"", Van Gogh sought to create a ""modern portrait,"" which he wrote to his sister ""impassions me most - much, much more than all the rest of my ""métier"".""<br/>6. Elaborating on this quote, Van Gogh scholar Jan Hulsker noted ""...much later generations experience it not only as psychologically striking, but also as a very unconventional and 'modern' portrait.""<br/>7. He also wrote, ""My self-portrait is done in nearly the same way but the blue is the fine blue of the Midi, and the clothes are a light lilac,"" which would refer to one of his final self-portraits painted in September the year previous.Van Gogh also wrote to Wilhelmina regarding the Portraits of Madame Ginoux he painted first in Arles in 1888 and again in February 1890 while at the hospital in Saint-Rémy.<br/>8. The second set were styled after the portrait of the same figure by Gauguin, and Van Gogh described Gachet's enthusiasm upon viewing the version painted earlier that year, which the artist had carried with him to the home in Auvers.<br/>9.

The Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda confiscated the work in 1937 as part of its campaign to rid Germany of so-called degenerate art, leading to Hermann Göring hurriedly selling it to a dealer in Amsterdam.<br/>4. The dealer in turn sold it to collector Siegfried Kramarsky, who brought it with him when he fled to New York, where the work was often lent to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.Kramarsky's family put the painting up for auction at Christie's New York on May 15, 1990, where it became famous for Ryoei Saito, honorary chairman of Daishowa Paper Manufacturing Co., paying US$82.5 million for it, making it then the world's most expensive painting.<br/>5. Remarkably, two days later Saito would buy Renoir's Bal du moulin de la Galette for a nearly-as-much $78.1 million at Sotheby's.<br/>6. The 75-year old Japanese businessman briefly caused a scandal when he said he would have the Van Gogh painting cremated with him after his death, though his aides later claimed Saito threatening to torch the masterpiece was just an expression of intense affection for it.Though he later said he would consider giving the painting to the Japanese government or a museum, no information has been made public about the exact location and ownership of the portrait since his death in 1996.<br/>7.

Commonly called Sien Hoornik, Clasina Maria Hoornik (1850 - 1904) lived with van Gogh during much of his time in The Hague from 1881 to 1883.<br/>4. Van Gogh used Sien, a pregnant prostitute, as a model for his work and later took Sien and her daughter into his home.<br/>5. Van Gogh made drawings and paintings of Sien and her daughter, baby and mother over that period, which reflected the domestic life and hardships of the working poor.<br/>6. Their relationship was not accepted by his family or supporters, although his brother Theo did not withdraw his support over it.<br/>7. It did contribute undoubtedly, however, to a split with Anton Mauve, a cousin-in-law and noted painter of the Hague School, who had introduced van Gogh to painting as well as supporting him financially, and whom van Gogh revered.<br/>8. At his brother Theo's urging, van Gogh left Sien in 1883 to paint in Drenthe, putting an end to the only domestic relationship he was ever to have.Sien resumed her life as a seamstress, cleaning woman and likely prostitute before marrying in 1901.<br/>9. <strike>On 12 November 1904, aged 54, she threw herself into the Schelde river and drowned, fulfilling a prophecy she had made to van Gogh in 1883: ""Yes, I'm a whore ... it’s bound to end up with me jumping into the water.""</strike><br/>"

He had married van Gogh's cousin, Ariëtte (Jet) Carbentus, in 1874 while she was still very young and he was already established and successful, and as such was lionised by the van Gogh family.<br/>5. At the time, he was busy with his massive ""Fishing Boat on the Beach"" that he was preparing for the next year's Salon, but he nevertheless found time for van Gogh to advise him on his drawings, inviting him to return in a few months time to review progress.After a last, humiliating, effort to win Kee over, an episode that put an end to his religious faith for ever, Van Gogh returned to his parents' home in Etten in late 1881.<br/>6. On Christmas Day that year he refused to attend church, provoking a violent quarrel with his father, a pastor, which resulted in his leaving home the very same day.He returned to The Hague and studied further under Mauve.<br/>7. Mauve helped him to establish a modest studio on the Schenkweg on the outer fringes of The Hague, lending him money to purchase furniture, and introduced him to the Pulchri Studio, The Hague's most important art society in which he himself played a major role.<br/>8. He also introduced Van Gogh to painting, first in oils and then with watercolor.<br/>"

During the latter part of 1873, Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Camille Pissarro, and Alfred Sisley organized the Société anonyme des artistes peintres, sculpteurs et graveurs (Cooperative and Anonymous Association of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers) to exhibit their artworks independently.<br/>3. <strike>At their first exhibition, held in April 1874, Monet exhibited the work that was to give the group its lasting name.</strike><br/>4. ""Impression, Sunrise"" was painted in 1872, depicting a Le Havre port landscape.<br/>5. From the painting's title the art critic Louis Leroy, in his review, ""L'Exposition des Impressionnistes,"" which appeared in Le Charivari, coined the term ""Impressionism"".<br/>6.

The primary purpose of the participants was not so much to promote a new style, but to free themselves from the constraints of the Salon de Paris.<br/>3. The exhibition, open to anyone prepared to pay 60 francs, gave artists the opportunity to show their work without the interference of a jury.Renoir chaired the hanging committee and did most of the work himself, as others members failed to present themselves.In addition to """" (pictured above) Monet presented four oil paintings and seven pastels.<br/>4.

Pissarro was asking 1000 francs for ""The Orchard"" and Monet the same for ""Impression: Sunrise"", neither of which sold.<br/>11.

Les_Demoiselles_d'Avignon-Rivalry_with_Matisse,9,"Category: Art<br/>Title: Les Demoiselles d'Avignon<br/>Section: Rivalry with Matisse<br/><br/>1. The Salon d'Automne of 1905 brought notoriety and attention to the works of Henri Matisse and the Les Fauves group.<br/>2. The latter gained their name after critic Louis Vauxcelles described their work with the phrase ""Donatello au milieu des fauves!""<br/>3. (""Donatello among the wild beasts""), contrasting the paintings with a Renaissance-type sculpture that shared the room with them.<br/>4. Henri Rousseau (1844–1910), an artist that Picasso knew and admired and who was not a Fauve, had his large jungle scene ""The Hungry Lion Throws Itself on the Antelope"" also hanging near the works by Matisse and which may have had an influence on the particular sarcastic term used in the press.<br/>5. Vauxcelles' comment was printed on 17 October 1905 in the daily newspaper ""Gil Blas"", and passed into popular usage.<br/>6. Although the pictures were widely derided—""A pot of paint has been flung in the face of the public"", declared the critic Camille Mauclair (1872–1945)—they also attracted some favorable attention.<br/>7. The painting that was singled out for the most attacks was Matisse's ""Woman with a Hat""; the purchase of this work by Gertrude and Leo Stein had a very positive effect on Matisse, who was suffering demoralization from the bad reception of his work.Matisse's notoriety and preeminence as the leader of the new movement in modern painting continued to build throughout 1906 and 1907, and Matisse attracted a following of artists including Georges Braque (1880–1963), André Derain (1880–1954), Maurice de Vlaminck (1876–1958).<br/>8. Picasso's work had passed through his Blue period and his Rose period and while he had a considerable following his reputation was tame in comparison to his rival Matisse.<br/>9. <strike>To make matters worse Matisse shocked the French public again at the 1907 Société des Artistes Indépendants when he exhibited his painting ""Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra),"" completed in early 1907.</strike><br/>10. The ""Blue Nude"" was one of the paintings that would later create an international sensation at the Armory Show of 1913 in New York City.By the spring of 1907 when he began to paint ""Les Demoiselles d'Avignon"", until its completion later in the year, Picasso was vying with Matisse for the preeminent position of being the perceived new leader of Modern painting.<br/>11. Upon its completion the shock and the impact of the painting propelled Picasso into the center of controversy and all but knocked Matisse and Fauvism off the map, virtually ending the movement by the following year.<br/>12. In 1907 Picasso joined the art gallery that had recently been opened in Paris by Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler (1884–1979).<br/>13. Kahnweiler was a German art historian, art collector who became one of the premier French art dealers of the 20th century.<br/>14. He became prominent in Paris beginning in 1907 for being among the first champions of Pablo Picasso, and especially his painting ""Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.""<br/>15. Before 1910 Picasso was already being recognized as one of the important leaders of Modern art alongside Henri Matisse who had been the undisputed leader of Fauvism and who was more than ten years older than he was and his contemporaries the Fauvist André Derain and the former Fauvist and fellow Cubist, Georges Braque.In his 1992 essay ""Reflections on Matisse"", the art critic Hilton Kramer wrote, <br/>16. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the impact of ""Les Demoiselles d'Avignon"", however, Matisse was never again mistaken for an avant-garde incendiary.<br/>17. With the bizarre painting that appalled and electrified the cognoscenti, which understood the ""Les Demoiselles"" was at once a response to Matisse's ""Le bonheur de vivre"" (1905–1906) and an assault upon the tradition from which it derived, Picasso effectively appropriated the role of avant-garde ""wild beast""—a role that, as far as public opinion was concerned, he was never to relinquish.<br/><br/>18. Kramer goes on to say, </br>19. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas Matisse had drawn upon a long tradition of European painting—from Giorgione, Poussin, and Watteau to Ingres, Cézanne, and Gauguin—to create a modern version of a pastoral paradise in ""Le bonheur de vivre"", Picasso had turned to an alien tradition of primitive art to create in ""Les Demoiselles"" a netherworld of strange gods and violent emotions.<br/>20. As between the mythological nymphs of ""Le bonheur de vivre"" and the grotesque effigies of ""Les Demoiselles,"" there was no question as to which was the more shocking or more intended to be shocking.<br/>21. Picasso had unleashed a vein of feeling that was to have immense consequences for the art and culture of the modern era while Matisse's ambition came to seem, as he said in his ""Notes of a Painter,"" more ""limited""—limited that is, to the realm of aesthetic pleasure.<br/>22. There was thus opened up, in the very first decade of the century and in the work of its two greatest artists, the chasm that has continued to divide the art of the modern era down to our own time.<br/>23.

From 16 to 31 July 1916 ""Les Demoiselles"" was exhibited to the public for the first time at the Salon d'Antin, an exhibition organized by André Salmon titled ""L'Art moderne en France"".<br/>2. The exhibition space at 26 rue d'Antin was lent by the famous couturier and art collector Paul Poiret.<br/>3. The larger Salon d'Automne and Salon des Indépendants had been closed due to World War I, making this the only Cubists exhibition in France since 1914.<br/>4. A review was published in ""Le Cri de Paris"": The Cubists are not waiting for the war to end to recommence hostilities against good sense.<br/>5. They are exhibiting at the Galerie Poiret naked women whose scattered parts are represented in all four corners of the canvas: here an eye, there an ear, over there a hand, a foot on top, a mouth below.<br/>6. M. Picasso, their leader, is possibly the least disheveled of the lot.<br/>7. He has painted, or rather daubed, five women who are, if the truth be told, all hacked up, and yet their limbs somehow manage to hold together.<br/>8. They have, moreover, piggish faces with eyes wandering negligently above their ears.<br/>9. <strike>An enthusiastic art-lover offered the artist 20,000 francs for this masterpiece.</strike><br/>10. M. Picasso wanted more.<br/>11. The art-lover did not insist.Picasso referred to his only entry at the Salon d'Antin as his Brothel painting calling it ""Le Bordel d'Avignon"" but André Salmon retitled it ""Les Demoiselles d'Avignon"" so as to lessen its scandalous impact on the public.<br/>12. Picasso never liked the title, however, preferring ""las chicas de Avignon,"" but Salmon's title stuck.The only other time the painting might have been exhibited to the public prior to a 1937 showing in New York was in 1918, in an exhibition dedicated to Picasso and Matisse at Galerie Paul Guillaume in Paris, though very little information exists about this exhibition or the presence (if at all) of ""Les Demoiselles"".Afterwards, the painting was rolled up and remained with Picasso until 1924 when, with urging and help from Breton and Louis Aragon (1897–1982), he sold it to designer Jacques Doucet (1853–1929), for 25,000 francs. <br/>"
Johannes_Vermeer-Abstract,4,"Category: Art<br/>Title: Johannes Vermeer<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. Johannes, Jan or Johan Vermeer (; 1632 – December 1675) was a Dutch painter who specialized in domestic interior scenes of middle-class life.<br/>2. Vermeer was a moderately successful provincial genre painter in his lifetime.<br/>3. He seems never to have been particularly wealthy, leaving his wife and children in debt at his death, perhaps because he produced relatively few paintings.Vermeer worked slowly and with great care, using bright colours and sometimes expensive pigments, with a preference for lapis lazuli and Indian yellow.<br/>4. <strike>He is particularly renowned for his masterly treatment and use of light in his work.Vermeer painted mostly domestic interior scenes.</strike><br/>5. ""Almost all his paintings are apparently set in two smallish rooms in his house in Delft; they show the same furniture and decorations in various arrangements and they often portray the same people, mostly women.<br/>6. ""Recognized during his lifetime in Delft and The Hague, his modest celebrity gave way to obscurity after his death; he was barely mentioned in Arnold Houbraken's major source book on 17th-century Dutch painting (""Grand Theatre of Dutch Painters and Women Artists""), and was thus omitted from subsequent surveys of Dutch art for nearly two centuries.In the 19th century, Vermeer was rediscovered by Gustav Friedrich Waagen and Théophile Thoré-Bürger, who published an essay attributing sixty-six pictures to him, although only thirty-four paintings are universally attributed to him today.<br/>7. Since that time, Vermeer's reputation has grown, and he is now acknowledged as one of the greatest painters of the Dutch Golden Age.<br/>"
Johannes_Vermeer-Theories_of_mechanical_aid,1,"Category: Art<br/>Title: Johannes Vermeer<br/>Section: Theories of mechanical aid<br/><br/>1. <strike>Vermeer's painting techniques have long been a source of debate, given their almost photorealistic attention to detail, despite Vermeer having had no formal training, and despite only limited evidence that Vermeer had created any preparatory sketches or traces for his paintings.In 2001, British artist David Hockney published the book ""Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters"", in which he argued that Vermeer - among other Renaissance artists including Hans Holbein and Diego Velázquez - used optics, and specifically some combination of curved mirrors, camera obscura and camera lucida, to achieve precise positioning in their compositions.</strike><br/>2. This became known as the Hockney–Falco thesis, named after Hockney and Charles M. Falco, another proponent of the theory.Working independently, in 2001 British architecture professor Philip Steadman published the book ""Vermeer's Camera: Uncovering the Truth behind the Masterpieces"", which specifically claimed that Vermeer had used a camera obscura to create his paintings.<br/>3. Noting that many of Vermeer's paintings had been painted in the same room, Steadman found six of his paintings that are precisely the right size if they had been painted from inside a camera obscura in the room's back wall.Supporters of these theories have pointed to evidence in some of Vermeer's paintings, such as the often-discussed sparkling pearly highlights in Vermeer's paintings, which they argue are the result of the primitive lens of a camera obscura producing halation.<br/>4. It was also postulated that a camera obscura was the mechanical cause of the ""exaggerated"" perspective seen in ""Lady at the Virginals with a Gentleman"" (London, Royal Collection).In 2008, American entrepreneur and inventor Tim Jenison developed the theory that Vermeer had used a camera obscura along with a ""comparator mirror"", which is similar in concept to a camera lucida but much simpler, and allows for easily matching color values.<br/>5. He later modified the theory to simply involve a concave mirror and a comparator mirror.<br/>6. He spent the next five years testing his theory by attempting to re-create ""The Music Lesson"" himself using these tools, a process captured in the 2013 documentary film ""Tim's Vermeer"".This theory remains disputed.<br/>7. Aside from the accurately observed mirror reflection above the lady at the virginals, there is no historical evidence regarding Vermeer's interest in optics.<br/>8. The detailed inventory of the artist's belongings drawn up after his death does not include a camera obscura or any similar device.<br/>"

Dalí is quoted as saying the reason he included boiled beans was ""one could not imagine swallowing all that unconscious meat without the presence of some mealy and melancholy vegetable.""<br/>10.

Swans_Reflecting_Elephants-Abstract,1,"Category: Art<br/>Title: Swans Reflecting Elephants<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. <strike>Swans Reflecting Elephants (1937) is a painting by the Spanish surrealist Salvador Dalí.</strike><br/>2. This painting is from Dalí's Paranoiac-critical period.<br/>3. Painted using oil on canvas, it contains one of Dalí's famous double images.<br/>4. The double images were a major part of Dalí's ""paranoia-critical method,"" which he put forward in his 1935 essay ""The Conquest of the Irrational.""<br/>5. He explained his process as a ""spontaneous method of irrational understanding based upon the interpretative critical association of delirious phenomena.""<br/>6. Dalí used this method to bring forth the hallucinatory forms, double images and visual illusions that filled his paintings during the Thirties.<br/>7. As with earlier ""Metamorphosis of Narcissus"", ""Swans Reflecting Elephants"" uses the reflection in a lake to create the double image seen in the painting.<br/>8. In ""Metamorphosis"", the reflection of Narcissus is used to mirror the shape of the hand on the right of the picture.<br/>9. Here, the three swans in front of bleak, leafless trees are reflected in the lake so that the swans' heads become the elephants' heads and the trees become the bodies of the elephants.<br/>10. In the background of the painting is a Catalonian landscape depicted in fiery fall colors, the brushwork creating swirls in the cliffs that surround the lake, to contrast with the stillness of the water <br/>"

Prior to Michelangelo's involvement, the Overseers of the Office of Works of Florence Cathedral, consisting mostly of members of the influential woolen cloth guild, the Arte della Lana, had plans to commission a series of twelve large Old Testament sculptures for the buttresses of the cathedral of Santa Maria Del Fiore.<br/>3. In 1410 Donatello made the first of the statues, a figure of Joshua in terracotta.<br/>4. A figure of Hercules, also in terracotta, was commissioned from the Florentine sculptor Agostino di Duccio in 1463 and was made perhaps under Donatello's direction.<br/>5. Eager to continue their project, in 1464, the ""Operai"" contracted Agostino to create a sculpture of David.<br/>6. A block of marble was provided, from a quarry in Carrara, a town in the Apuan Alps in northern Tuscany.<br/>7. Agostino only got as far as beginning to shape the legs, feet and the torso, roughing out some drapery and probably gouging a hole between the legs.<br/>8. His association with the project ceased, for reasons unknown, with the death of Donatello in 1466, and ten years later Antonio Rossellino was commissioned to take up where Agostino had left off.Rossellino's contract was terminated soon thereafter, and the block of marble remained neglected for twenty-five years, all the while exposed to the elements in the yard of the cathedral workshop.<br/>9. This was of great concern to the ""Opera"" authorities, as such a large piece of marble not only was costly but also represented a large amount of labour and difficulty in its transportation to Florence.<br/>10. In 1500, an inventory of the cathedral workshops described the piece as ""a certain figure of marble called David, badly blocked out and supine.""<br/>11. A year later, documents showed that the ""Operai"" were determined to find an artist who could take this large piece of marble and turn it into a finished work of art.<br/>12. They ordered the block of stone, which they called ""The Giant"", ""raised on its feet"" so that a master experienced in this kind of work might examine it and express an opinion.<br/>13. Though Leonardo da Vinci and others were consulted, it was Michelangelo, only twenty-six years old, who convinced the ""Operai"" that he deserved the commission.<br/>14. On 16 August 1501, Michelangelo was given the official contract to undertake this challenging new task.<br/>15. He began carving the statue early in the morning on 13 September, a month after he was awarded the contract.<br/>16. He would work on the massive statue for more than two years.<br/>"

This picture, which has a large number of figures, conforms the most closely to the format of the paintings that had been done around the walls.The final scene is the story of Noah's drunkenness.<br/>7. After the Flood, Noah tills the soil and grows vines.<br/>8. He is shown doing so, in the background of the picture.<br/>9. He becomes drunk and inadvertently exposes himself.<br/>10. <strike>His youngest son, Ham, brings his two brothers Shem and Japheth to see the sight but they discreetly cover their father with a cloak.</strike><br/>11. Ham is later cursed by Noah and told that the descendants of Ham's son Canaan will serve Shem and Japheth's descendants forever.<br/>12. Taken together, these three pictures serve to show that Humankind had moved a long way from God's perfect creation.<br/>13. However, it is through Shem and his descendants, the Israelites, that Salvation will come to the world.Since Michelangelo executed the nine Biblical scenes in reverse chronological order, some analyses of the frescoes of the vault commence with the ""Drunkenness of Noah"".<br/>14. Tolnay's Neoplatonic interpretation sees the story of Noah at the beginning and the act of Creation by God as the conclusion of the process of ""deificatio"" and the return from physical to spiritual being.<br/>"

Diego_Rivera-Career_in_Mexico,4,"Category: Art<br/>Title: Diego Rivera<br/>Section: Career in Mexico<br/><br/>1. In 1920, urged by Alberto J. Pani, the Mexican ambassador to France, Rivera left France and traveled through Italy studying its art, including Renaissance frescoes.<br/>2. After José Vasconcelos became Minister of Education, Rivera returned to Mexico in 1921 to become involved in the government sponsored Mexican mural program planned by Vasconcelos.<br/>3. ""See also Mexican muralism.""<br/>4. <strike>The program included such Mexican artists as José Clemente Orozco, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and Rufino Tamayo, and the French artist Jean Charlot.</strike><br/>5. In January 1922, he painted – experimentally in encaustic – his first significant mural ""Creation"" in the Bolívar Auditorium of the National Preparatory School in Mexico City while guarding himself with a pistol against right-wing students.In the autumn of 1922, Rivera participated in the founding of the Revolutionary Union of Technical Workers, Painters and Sculptors, and later that year he joined the Mexican Communist Party (including its Central Committee).<br/>6. His murals, subsequently painted in fresco only, dealt with Mexican society and reflected the country's 1910 Revolution.<br/>7. Rivera developed his own native style based on large, simplified figures and bold colors with an Aztec influence clearly present in murals at the Secretariat of Public Education in Mexico City begun in September 1922, intended to consist of one hundred and twenty-four frescoes, and finished in 1928.His art, in a fashion similar to the steles of the Maya, tells stories.<br/>8. The mural ""En el Arsenal"" (In the Arsenal) shows on the right-hand side Tina Modotti holding an ammunition belt and facing Julio Antonio Mella, in a light hat, and Vittorio Vidali behind in a black hat.<br/>9. However, the ""En el Arsenal"" detail shown does not include the right-hand side described nor any of the three individuals mentioned; instead it shows the left-hand side with Frida Kahlo handing out munitions.<br/>10. Leon Trotsky lived with Rivera and Kahlo for several months while exiled in Mexico.<br/>11. Some of Rivera's most famous murals are featured at the National School of Agriculture at Chapingo near Texcoco (1925–27), in the Cortés Palace in Cuernavaca (1929–30), and the National Palace in Mexico City (1929–30, 1935).<br/>"

The Rockefellers wanted to have a mural put on the ground-floor wall of Rockefeller Center.<br/>2. <strike>Nelson Rockefeller wanted Henri Matisse or Pablo Picasso to do it because he favored their modern style, but neither was available.</strike><br/>3. Diego Rivera was one of Nelson Rockefeller's mother's favorite artists and therefore was commissioned to create the huge mural.<br/>4. He was given a theme: ""Man at the Crossroads Looking with Hope and High Vision to the Choosing of a New and Better Future.""<br/>5. Rockefeller wanted the painting to make people pause and think.<br/>6. Rivera was to be paid $21,000 for the work.<br/>7. He was officially commissioned by Todd-Robertson-Todd Engineering, the development agents for the building.<br/>8. The full commission envisaged three murals.<br/>9. ""Man at the Crossroads"" would be in the center.<br/>10. It would be flanked by ""The Frontier of Ethical Evolution"" and ""The Frontier of Material Development"".<br/>11. The central composition was intended to contrast Capitalism and Socialism.<br/>12. This basic compositional idea was approved by Rockefeller.<br/>"
Man_at_the_Crossroads-Work,12,"Category: Art<br/>Title: Man at the Crossroads<br/>Section: Work<br/><br/>1. Rivera's composition depicted many aspects of contemporary social and scientific culture.<br/>2. In the center, a workman was depicted controlling machinery.<br/>3. Before him, a giant fist emerged holding an orb depicting the recombination of atoms and dividing cells in acts of chemical and biological generation.<br/>4. From the central figure four propeller-like shapes stretched to the corner of the composition, depicting arcs of light created by giant lenses anchoring the left and right edges of the space.<br/>5. Rivera described these as ""elongated ellipses"".<br/>6. Within these, cosmological and biological forces such as exploding suns and cell-forms were depicted.<br/>7. These represented the discoveries made possible by the telescope and the microscope.<br/>8. Between and beyond the arcs were scenes of modern social life.<br/>9. Wealthy society women are seen playing cards and smoking at the left.<br/>10. Opposite, on the right, Lenin is seen holding hands with a multi-racial group of workers.<br/>11. Soldiers and war machinery occupied the top left above the society women, and a Russian May Day rally with red flags was seen at the right, above Lenin.<br/>12. <strike>For Rivera, this represented contrasting social visions: the ""debauched rich"" watched by the unemployed while war rages; and a socialist utopia ushered in by Lenin.</strike><br/>13. Beyond the giant lenses to left and right were depicted figures contemplating the central scene, behind which were gigantic classical statues.<br/>14. The one on the left depicted an angry Jupiter, whose raised hand holding a thunderbolt has been stuck off by a lightening strike.<br/>15. The one on the right was a headless seated Caesar.<br/>16. For Rivera these represented the replacement of superstition by scientific mastery of nature, and the overthrow of authoritarian rule by liberated workers.<br/>17. The bottom part of the painting was to depict the controlled growth of natural resources, in the form of a variety of plants emerging from their roots, visible in a cut-away view under the soil.<br/>18. However, this section was never completed.<br/>19. It exists only in the later recreation of the composition in Mexico.<br/>"
The_Creation_of_Adam-Anatomical_theories,4,"Category: Art<br/>Title: The Creation of Adam<br/>Section: Anatomical theories<br/><br/>1. Several hypotheses have been put forward about the meaning of ""The Creation of Adam""'s highly original composition, many of them taking Michelangelo's well-documented expertise in human anatomy as their starting point.<br/>2. In 1990, an Anderson, Indiana physician named Frank Lynn Meshberger, M.D.<br/>3. noted in the medical publication the ""Journal of the American Medical Association"" that the background figures and shapes portrayed behind the figure of God appeared to be an anatomically accurate picture of the human brain.<br/>4. <strike>Dr. Meshberger's interpretation has been discussed by Dr. Mark Lee Appler.</strike><br/>5. On close examination, borders in the painting correlate with major sulci of the cerebrum in the inner and outer surface of the brain, the brain stem, the frontal lobe, the basilar artery, the pituitary gland and the optic chiasm.Alternatively, it has been observed that the red cloth around God has the shape of a human uterus (one art historian has called it a ""uterine mantle""), and that the scarf hanging out, coloured green, could be a newly cut umbilical cord.<br/>6. ""This is an interesting hypothesis that presents the Creation scene as an idealised representation of the physical birth of man.<br/>7. It explains the navel that appears on Adam, which is at first perplexing because he was created, not born of a woman.""<br/>"

Rembrandt-Expert_assessments,"15, 16, 17","Category: Art<br/>Title: Rembrandt<br/>Section: Expert assessments<br/><br/>1. In 1968 the Rembrandt Research Project began under the sponsorship of the Netherlands Organization for the Advancement of Scientific Research; it was initially expected to last a highly optimistic ten years.<br/>2. Art historians teamed up with experts from other fields to reassess the authenticity of works attributed to Rembrandt, using all methods available, including state-of-the-art technical diagnostics, and to compile a complete new catalogue raisonné of his paintings.<br/>3. As a result of their findings, many paintings that were previously attributed to Rembrandt have been removed from their list, although others have been added back.<br/>4. Many of those removed are now thought to be the work of his students.One example of activity is ""The Polish Rider"", in New York's Frick Collection.<br/>5. Rembrandt's authorship had been questioned by at least one scholar, Alfred von Wurzbach, at the beginning of the twentieth century, but for many decades later most scholars, including the foremost authority writing in English, Julius S. Held, agreed that it was indeed by the master.<br/>6. In the 1980s, however, Dr. Josua Bruyn of the Foundation Rembrandt Research Project, cautiously and tentatively attributed the painting to one of Rembrandt's closest and most talented pupils, Willem Drost, about whom little is known.<br/>7. But Bruyn's remained a minority opinion, the suggestion of Drost's authorship is now generally rejected, and the Frick itself never changed its own attribution, the label still reading ""Rembrandt"" and not ""attributed to"" or ""school of"".<br/>8. More recent opinion has shifted even more decisively in favor of the Frick, with Simon Schama in his 1999 book ""Rembrandt's Eyes"", and a Rembrandt Project scholar, Ernst van de Wetering (Melbourne Symposium, 1997) both arguing for attribution to the master.<br/>9. Those few scholars who still question Rembrandt's authorship feel that the execution is uneven, and favour different attributions for different parts of the work.A similar issue was raised by Simon Schama in his book ""Rembrandt's Eye"" concerning the verification of titles associated with the subject matter depicted in Rembrandt's works.<br/>10. For example, the exact subject being portrayed in ""Aristotle with a Bust of Homer"" (recently retitled by curators at the Metropolitan Museum) has been directly challenged by Schama applying the scholarship of Paul Crenshaw.<br/>11. Schama presents a substantial argument that it was the famous ancient Greek painter Apelles who is depicted in contemplation by Rembrandt and not Aristotle.Another painting, ""Pilate Washing His Hands"", is also of questionable attribution.<br/>12. Critical opinion of this picture has varied since 1905, when Wilhelm von Bode described it as ""a somewhat abnormal work"" by Rembrandt.<br/>13. Scholars have since dated the painting to the 1660s and assigned it to an anonymous pupil, possibly Aert de Gelder.<br/>14. The composition bears superficial resemblance to mature works by Rembrandt but lacks the master's command of illumination and modeling.The attribution and re-attribution work is ongoing.<br/>15. <strike>In 2005 four oil paintings previously attributed to Rembrandt's students were reclassified as the work of Rembrandt himself: ""Study of an Old Man in Profile"" and ""Study of an Old Man with a Beard"" from a US private collection, ""Study of a Weeping Woman"", owned by the Detroit Institute of Arts, and ""Portrait of an Elderly Woman in a White Bonnet"", painted in 1640.Rembrandt's own studio practice is a major factor in the difficulty of attribution, since, like many masters before him, he encouraged his students to copy his paintings, sometimes finishing or retouching them to be sold as originals, and sometimes selling them as authorized copies.</strike><br/>16. <strike>Additionally, his style proved easy enough for his most talented students to emulate.</strike><br/>17. <strike>Further complicating matters is the uneven quality of some of Rembrandt's own work, and his frequent stylistic evolutions and experiments.</strike><br/>18. As well, there were later imitations of his work, and restorations which so seriously damaged the original works that they are no longer recognizable.<br/>19. It is highly likely that there will never be universal agreement as to what does and what does not constitute a genuine Rembrandt.<br/>"
Rembrandt-Name_and_signature,11,"Category: Art<br/>Title: Rembrandt<br/>Section: Name and signature<br/><br/>1. <br/>2. ""Rembrandt"" is a modification of the spelling of the artist's first name that he introduced in 1633.<br/>3. Roughly speaking, his earliest signatures (ca.<br/>4. 1625) consisted of an initial ""R"", or the monogram ""RH"" (for Rembrant Harmenszoon; i.e.<br/>5. ""Rembrant, the son of Harmen""), and starting in 1629, ""RHL"" (the ""L"" stood, presumably, for Leiden).<br/>6. In 1632, he used this monogram early in the year, then added his patronymic to it, ""RHL-van Rijn"", but replaced this form in that same year and began using his first name alone with its original spelling, ""Rembrant"".<br/>7. In 1633 he added a ""d"", and maintained this form consistently from then on, proving that this minor change had a meaning for him (whatever it might have been).<br/>8. This change is purely visual; it does not change the way his name is pronounced.<br/>9. Curiously enough, despite the large number of paintings and etchings signed with this modified first name, most of their documents that mentioned him during his lifetime retained the original ""Rembrant"" spelling.<br/>10. (Note: the rough chronology of signature forms above applies to the paintings, and to a lesser degree to the etchings; from 1632, presumably, there is only one etching signed ""RHL-v. Rijn,"" the large-format ""Raising of Lazarus,"" B 73).<br/>11. <strike>His practice of signing his work with his first name, later followed by Vincent van Gogh, was probably inspired by Raphael, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo who, then as now, were referred to by their first names alone.</strike><br/>"

Bathsheba-Biblical_narrative,17,"Category: Art<br/>Title: Bathsheba<br/>Section: Biblical narrative<br/><br/>1. The meaning of the Hebrew form of the name ""Bathsheba"" is ""daughter of the oath"", ""bat"" meaning daughter.<br/>2. The second part of the name appears in as ""shua"" (signifying ""wealth"") (compare ).Bathsheba was the daughter of Eliam (, who is called Ammiel in ).<br/>3. Her father is identified by some scholars with Eliam mentioned in as the son of Ahithophel, who is described as the Gilonite.<br/>4. (See King David's Warriors.<br/>5. )Bathsheba was the wife of Uriah the Hittite, and afterward of David, by whom she gave birth to Solomon, who succeeded David as king.<br/>6. (United Kingdom of Israel and Judah).<br/>7. The story of David's seduction of Bathsheba, told in , is omitted in Chronicles.<br/>8. The story is told that David, while walking on the roof of his palace, saw Bathsheba, who was then the wife of Uriah, having a bath.<br/>9. He immediately desired her and later made her pregnant.In an effort to conceal his sin, David summoned Uriah from the army (with whom he was on campaign) in the hope that Uriah would re-consummate his marriage and think that the child was his.<br/>10. Uriah was unwilling to violate the ancient kingdom rule applying to warriors in active service.<br/>11. Rather than go home to his own bed, he preferred to remain with the palace troops.<br/>12. After repeated efforts to convince Uriah to have sex with Bathsheba, the king gave the order to his general, Joab, that Uriah should be placed in the front lines of the battle, where it was the most dangerous, and left to the hands of the enemy (where he was more likely to die).<br/>13. David had Uriah himself carry the message that ordered his death.<br/>14. After Uriah was dead, David made the now widowed Bathsheba his wife.David's action was displeasing to the Lord, who accordingly sent Nathan the prophet to reprove the king.<br/>15. After relating the parable of the rich man who took away the one little ewe lamb of his poor neighbor (II Samuel 12:1-6), and exciting the king's anger against the unrighteous act, the prophet applied the case directly to David's action with regard to Bathsheba.<br/>16. The king at once confessed his sin and expressed sincere repentance.<br/>17. <strike>Bathsheba's child by David was struck with a severe illness and died a few days after birth, which the king accepted as his punishment.</strike><br/>18. Nathan also noted that David's house would be cursed with turmoil because of this murder.<br/>19. This came to pass years later when one of David's much-loved sons, Absalom, led an insurrection that plunged the kingdom into civil war.<br/>20. Moreover, to manifest his claim to be the new king, Absalom had sexual intercourse in public with ten of his father's concubines, which could be considered a direct, tenfold divine retribution for David's taking the woman of another man.<br/>21. (II Samuel 16:20–23) In David's old age, Bathsheba secured the succession to the throne of her son Solomon, instead of David's eldest surviving son Adonijah.<br/>22. ().Some commentators have written that Bathsheba may have written at least part of Proverbs 31 as suggested by the postulated connections between King Lemuel aka King Solomon.The story of David's adultery sets up the context for the penitential Psalm 51 (50), also known as ""Miserere"" (""Have mercy on me, O God"").<br/>"

He therefore induced Absalom to commit an unpardonable crime (II Sam.<br/>4. xvi.<br/>5. 21), which sooner or later would have brought with it, according to Jewish law, the penalty of death; the motive for this advice being to remove Absalom, and thus to make a way for himself to the throne.<br/>6. His astrological information had been, however, misunderstood by him; for in reality it only predicted that his granddaughter, Bathsheba, the daughter of his son Eliam, would become queen (Sanh.<br/>7. 101b, YalḲ.<br/>8. Sam.<br/>9. § 150).<br/>10. The Midrash portrays the influence of Satan bringing about the sinful relation of David and Bathsheba as follows: Bathsheba was bathing, perhaps behind a screen of wickerwork.<br/>11. Satan is depicted as coming in the disguise of a bird.<br/>12. David, shooting at the bird, strikes the screen, splitting it; thus Bathsheba is revealed in her beauty to David (Sanhedrin 107a).<br/>"

Offensive tactics include improving a team's position on the ice by advancing the puck out of one's zone towards the opponent's zone, progressively by gaining lines, first your own blue line, then the red line and finally the opponent's blue line.<br/>2. NHL rules instated for the 2006 season redefined offside to make the two-line pass legal; a player may pass the puck from behind his own blue line, past both that blue line and the centre red line, to a player on the near side of the opponents' blue line.<br/>3. Offensive tactics are designed ultimately to score a goal by taking a shot.<br/>4. When a player purposely directs the puck towards the opponent's goal, he or she is said to ""shoot"" the puck.A ""deflection"" is a shot that redirects a shot or a pass towards the goal from another player, by allowing the puck to strike the stick and carom towards the goal.<br/>5. A ""one-timer"" is a shot struck directly off a pass, without receiving the pass and shooting in two separate actions.<br/>6. <strike>""Headmanning the puck"", also known as ""cherry-picking"" or ""breaking out"", is the tactic of rapidly passing to the player farthest down the ice.A team that is losing by one or two goals in the last few minutes of play will often elect to ""pull the goalie""; that is, remove the goaltender and replace him or her with an ""extra attacker"" on the ice in the hope of gaining enough advantage to score a goal.</strike><br/>7. However, it is an act of desperation, as it sometimes leads to the opposing team extending their lead by scoring a goal in the empty net.A ""delayed penalty call"" occurs when a penalty offense is committed by the team that does not have possession of the puck.<br/>8. In this circumstance the team with possession of the puck is allowed to complete the play; that is, play continues until a goal is scored, a player on the opposing team gains control of the puck, or the team in possession commits an infraction or penalty of their own.<br/>9. Because the team on which the penalty was called cannot control the puck without stopping play, it is impossible for them to score a goal.<br/>10. However, it is possible for the controlling team to mishandle the puck into their own net.<br/>11. In these cases the team in possession of the puck can pull the goalie for an extra attacker without fear of being scored on.<br/>12. If a delayed penalty is signaled and the team in possession scores, the penalty is still assessed to the offending player, but not served.<br/>13. This rule was recently changed by the NCAA for college level hockey in the United States.<br/>14. In college games, the penalty is still enforced even if the team in possession scores.One of the most important strategies for a team is their ""forecheck"".<br/>15. Forechecking is the act of attacking the opposition in their defensive zone.<br/>16. Forechecking is an important part of the ""dump and chase"" strategy (i.e.<br/>17. shooting the puck into the offensive zone and then chasing after it).<br/>18. Each team will use their own unique system but the main ones are: 2–1–2, 1–2–2, and 1–4.<br/>19. The 2–1–2 is the most basic forecheck system where two forwards will go in deep and pressure the opposition's defencemen, the third forward stays high and the two defencemen stay at the blueline.<br/>20. The 1–2–2 is a bit more conservative system where one forward pressures the puck carrier and the other two forwards cover the oppositions' wingers, with the two defencemen staying at the blueline.<br/>21. The 1–4 is the most defensive forecheck system, referred to as the trap, where one forward will apply pressure to the puck carrier around the oppositions' blueline and the other 4 players stand basically in a line by their blueline in hopes the opposition will skate into one of them.There are many other little tactics used in the game of hockey.<br/>22. ""Pinching"" is the term used when a defencemen pressures the opposition's winger in the offensive zone when they are breaking out, attempting to stop their attack and keep the puck in the offensive zone.<br/>23. A ""saucer pass"" is a pass used when an opposition's stick or body is in the passing lane.<br/>24. It is the act of raising the puck over the obstruction and having it land on a teammate's stick.<br/>"

Cycling-Equipment,1,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Cycling<br/>Section: Equipment<br/><br/>1. <strike>In many countries, the most commonly used vehicle for road transport is a utility bicycle.</strike><br/>2. These have frames with relaxed geometry, protecting the rider from shocks of the road and easing steering at low speeds.<br/>3. Utility bicycles tend to be equipped with accessories such as mudguards, panier racks and lights which extends their usefulness on a daily basis.<br/>4. As the bicycle is so effective as a means of transportation various companies have developed methods of carrying anything from the weekly shop to children on bicycles.<br/>5. Certain countries around the world rely heavily on bicycles and their culture has developed around the bicycle as a primary form of transport.<br/>6. In Europe Belgium and Holland are two of the biggest advocates and users of bicycles as a method of day to day transportation.<br/>7. Road bikes tend to have a more upright shape and a shorter wheelbase, which make the bike more mobile but harder to ride slowly.<br/>8. The design, coupled with low or dropped handlebars, requires the rider to bend forward more, utilizing stronger muscles (particularly the gluteus maximus) and reducing air resistance at high speed.The price of a new bicycle can range from US$50 to more than US$20,000 (the highest priced bike in the world is the custom Madone by Damien Hirst, sold at $500,000 USD), depending on quality, type and weight (the most exotic road bicycles can weigh as little as 3.2 kg (7 lb)).<br/>9. However, UCI regulations stipulates a legal race bike cannot weigh less than 6.8 kg (14.99 lbs).<br/>10. Being measured for a bike and taking it for a test ride are recommended before buying.The drivetrain components of the bike should also be considered.<br/>11. A middle grade dérailleur is sufficient for a beginner, although many utility bikes come equipped with hub gears.<br/>12. If the rider plans a significant amount of hillclimbing, a triple-crank (three chainrings) front gear system may be preferred.<br/>13. Otherwise, the relatively lighter and less expensive two chainrings may be better.<br/>14. Much simpler fixed wheel bikes are also available.Many road bikes along with mountain bikes include clipless pedals to which special shoes attach, via a cleat, permitting the rider to pull on the pedals as well as push.<br/>15. Other possible accessories for the bicycle include front and rear lights, bells or horns, child carrying seats, cycling computers with GPS, locks, bar tape, fenders (mud-guards), baggage racks, baggage carriers and pannier bags, water bottles and bottle cages.For basic maintenance and repairs, cyclists can choose to carry a pump (or a CO2 cartridge), a puncture repair kit, a spare inner tube, and tire levers.<br/>16. Cycling can be more efficient and comfortable with special shoes, gloves, and shorts.<br/>17. In wet weather, riding can be more tolerable with waterproof clothes, such as cape, jacket, trousers (pants) and overshoes.Items legally required in some jurisdictions, or voluntarily adopted for safety reasons, include bicycle helmets, generator or battery operated lights, reflectors, and audible signalling devices such as a bell or horn.<br/>18. Extras include studded tires and a bicycle computer.Bikes can also be heavily customized, with different seat designs and handle bars, for example.<br/>"

Short corners begin with five defenders (usually including the keeper) positioned behind the back line and at least 5 m from the 'insert' position of the ball.</br>8. All other players in the defending team must be beyond the centre line, that is not in their 'own' half of the pitch, until the ball is in play.<br/>9. Attacking players begin the play standing outside the scoring circle, except for one attacker who starts the corner by playing the ball from a mark 10 m either side of the goal (the circle has a 14.63 m radius).<br/>10. This player puts the ball into play by pushing or hitting the ball to the other attackers outside the circle; the ball must pass outside the circle and then put back into the circle before the attackers may make a shot at the goal from which a goal can be scored.<br/>11. FIH rules do not forbid a shot at goal before the ball leaves the circle after being 'inserted', nor is a shot at the goal from outside the circle prohibited, but a goal cannot be scored at all if the ball has not gone out of the circle and cannot be scored from a shot from outside the circle if it is not again played by an attacking player before it enters the goal.For safety reasons, the first shot of a penalty corner must not exceed 460 mm high (the height of the ""backboard"" of the goal) at the point it crosses the goal line if it is hit.<br/>12. However, if the ball is deemed to be below backboard height, the ball can be subsequently deflected above this height by another player (defender or attacker), providing that this deflection does not lead to danger.<br/>13. Note that the ""Slap"" stroke (a sweeping motion towards the ball, where the stick is kept on or close to the ground when striking the ball) is classed as a hit, and so the first shot at goal must be below backboard height for this type of shot also.If the first shot at goal in a short corner situation is a push, flick or scoop, in particular the ""drag flick"" (which has become popular at international and national league standards), the shot is permitted to rise above the height of the backboard, as long as the shot is not deemed dangerous to any opponent.<br/>14. This form of shooting was developed because it is not height restricted in the same way as the first hit shot at the goal and players with good technique are able to drag-flick with as much power as many others can hit a ball.<br/>"
Handball-Abstract,7,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Handball<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. Handball (also known as team handball, Olympic handball, European team handball, European handball, or Borden ball) is a team sport in which two teams of seven players each (six outfield players and a goalkeeper on each team) pass a ball to throw it into the goal of the other team.<br/>2. A standard match consists of two periods of 30 minutes, and the team that scores more goals wins.Modern handball is played on a court 40 by 20 meters (131 by 66 ft), with a goal in the center of each end.<br/>3. The goals are surrounded by a 6-meter zone where only the defending goalkeeper is allowed; the goals must be scored by throwing the ball from outside the zone or while ""diving"" into it.<br/>4. The sport is usually played indoors, but outdoor variants exist in the forms of field handball and Czech handball (which were more common in the past) and beach handball (also called sandball).<br/>5. The game is quite fast and includes body contact, as the defenders try to stop the attackers from approaching the goal.<br/>6. Goals are scored quite frequently; usually both teams score at least 20 goals each, and it is not uncommon for both teams to score more than 30 goals.The game was codified at the end of the 19th century in northern Europe, chiefly in Scandinavia and Germany.<br/>7. <strike>The modern set of rules was published in 1917 in Germany, and had several revisions since.</strike><br/>8. The first international games were played under these rules for men in 1925 and for women in 1930.<br/>9.

Sailing-Heeling,23,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Sailing<br/>Section: Heeling<br/><br/>1. When a ship or boat leans over to one side, from the action of waves or from the centrifugal force of a turn or under wind pressure or from amount of exposed topsides, it is said to 'heel'.<br/>2. A sailing boat that is over-canvassed and therefore heeling, may sail less efficiently depending on fundamental or opportunistic factors such as temporary nature of the feature (e.g.<br/>3. wind gust), use (e.g.<br/>4. racing), crew ability, point of sail, hull size & design.When a vessel is subject to a heeling force (such as wind pressure), vessel buoyancy & beam of the hull will counter-act the heeling force.<br/>5. A weighted keel provides additional means to right the boat.<br/>6. In some high-performance racing yachts, water ballast or the angle of a canting keel can be changed to provide additional righting force to counteract heeling.<br/>7. The crew may move their personal weight to the high (upwind) side of the boat, this is called ""hiking"", which also changes the centre of gravity & produces a righting lever to reduce the degree of heeling.<br/>8. Incidental benefits include faster vessel speed caused by more efficient action of the hull & sails.<br/>9. Other options to reduce heeling include reducing exposed sail area & efficiency of the sail setting & a variant of hiking called ""trapezing"".<br/>10. This can only be done if the vessel is designed for this, as in dinghy sailing.<br/>11. A sailor can (usually involuntarily) try turning upwind in gusts (it is known as ""rounding up"").<br/>12. This can lead to difficulties in controlling the vessel if over-canvassed.<br/>13. Wind can be spilled from the sails by 'sheeting out', or loosening them.<br/>14. The number of sails, their size and shape can be altered.<br/>15. Raising the dinghy centreboard can reduce heeling by allowing more leeway.<br/>16. The increasingly asymmetric underwater shape of the hull matching the increasing angle of heel may generate an increasing directional turning force into the wind.<br/>17. The sails' centre of effort will also increase this turning effect or force on the vessel's motion due to increasing lever effect with increased heeling which shows itself as increased human effort required to steer a straight course.<br/>18. Increased heeling reduces exposed sail area relative to the wind direction, so leading to an equilibrium state.<br/>19. As more heeling force causes more heel, weather helm may be experienced.<br/>20. This condition has a braking effect on the vessel but has the safety effect in that an excessively hard pressed boat will try and turn into the wind therefore reducing the forces on the sail.<br/>21. Small amounts (≤5 degrees) of weather helm are generally considered desirable because of the consequent aerofoil lift effect from the rudder.<br/>22. This aerofoil lift produces helpful motion to windward & the corollary of the reason why lee helm is dangerous.<br/>23. <strike>Lee helm, the opposite of weather helm, is generally considered to be dangerous because the vessel turns away from the wind when the helm is released, thus increasing forces on the sail at a time when the helmsperson is not in control.</strike><br/>"

The 880 yard run, or half mile, was the forebear of the 800 m distance and it has its roots in competitions in the United Kingdom in the 1830s.<br/>3. The 1500 m came about as a result of running three laps of a 500 m track, which was commonplace in continental Europe in the 20th century.Runners start the race from a standing position along a curved starting line and after hearing the starter's pistol they head towards the innermost track to follow the quickest route to the finish.<br/>4. In 800 m races athletes begin at a staggered starting point before the turn in the track and they must remain in their lanes for the first 100 m of the race.<br/>5. This rule was introduced to reduce the amount of physical jostling between runners in the early stages of the race.<br/>6. Physiologically, these middle-distance events demand that athletes have good aerobic and anaerobic energy producing systems, and also that they have strong speed endurance.The 1500 m and mile run events have historically been some of the most prestigious track and field events.<br/>7. Swedish rivals Gunder Hägg and Arne Andersson broke each other's 1500 m and mile world records on a number of occasions in the 1940s.<br/>8. The prominence of the distances were maintained by Roger Bannister, who (in 1954) was the first to run the long-elusive four-minute mile, and Jim Ryun's exploits served to popularise interval training.<br/>9. Races between British rivals Sebastian Coe, Steve Ovett and Steve Cram characterised middle-distance running in 1980s.<br/>10. From the 1990s onwards, North Africans such as Noureddine Morceli of Algeria and Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco came to dominate the 1500 and mile events.Beyond the short distances of sprinting events, factors such as an athlete's reactions and top speed becomes less important, while qualities such as pace, race tactics and endurance become more so.<br/>"
Track_and_field-Javelin_throw,6,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Track and field<br/>Section: Javelin throw<br/><br/>1. As an implement of war and hunting, javelin throwing began in prehistoric times.<br/>2. Along with the discus, the javelin was the second throwing event in the ancient Olympic pentathlon.<br/>3. Records from 708 BC show two javelin competition types co-existing: throwing at a target and throwing the javelin for distance.<br/>4. It was the latter type from which the modern event derives.<br/>5. In ancient competitions, athletes would wrap an ""ankyle"" (thin leather strip) around the javelin that acted as a sling to facilitate extra distance.<br/>6. <strike>The javelin throw gained much popularity in Scandinavia in the late 18th century and athletes from the region are still among the most dominant throwers in men's competitions.</strike><br/>7. The modern event features a short run up on a track and then the thrower releases the javelin before the foul line.The first Olympic men's javelin throw contest was held in 1908 and a women's competition was introduced in 1932.<br/>8. The first javelins were made of various types of wood, but in the 1950s, former athlete Bud Held introduced a hollow javelin, then a metal javelin, both of which increased throwers performances.<br/>9. Another former athlete, Miklós Németh invented the rough-tailed javelin and throws reached in excess of 100 m – edging towards the limits of stadia.<br/>10. The distances and the increasing number of horizontal landings led the IAAF to redesign the men's javelin to reduce distance and increase the implement's downward pitching moment to allow for easier measurement.<br/>11. Rough-tailed designs were banned in 1991 and all marks achieved with such javelins were removed from the record books.<br/>12. The women's javelin underwent a similar redesign in 1999.<br/>13. The current javelin specifications are 2.6 to 2.7 m in length and 800 grams in weight for men, and between 2.2 to 2.3 m and 600 g for women.<br/>"
Olympic_weightlifting-History,20,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Olympic weightlifting<br/>Section: History<br/><br/>1. Competition among people concerning who can lift the heaviest weight has been recorded in diverse and ancient civilizations as early as the earliest known recordings of such human events, including those found in Egypt, China and in ancient Greece.<br/>2. Today, the modern sport of weightlifting traces its origins to the European competitions of the 19th century.<br/>3. The first male world champion was crowned in 1891.<br/>4. Women's competition did not exist, and the weightlifters were not categorised by height or weight.The first Olympic Games of 1896 included weightlifting in the Field event of the predecessor to today's Track and Field or Athletics event.<br/>5. During the 1900 Olympic Games, there was no weightlifting event.<br/>6. Weightlifting resumed as an event, again in Athletics, in 1904 but was omitted from the Games of 1908 and 1912.<br/>7. These were the last Games until after the First World War.<br/>8. In these early Games, a distinction was drawn between lifting with 'one hand' only and lifting with 'two hands'.<br/>9. The winner of the 'one hand' competition in 1896 was Launceston Elliot, while the winner of the 'two hands' event was Viggo Jensen of Denmark.<br/>10. In 1920, weightlifting returned to the Olympics and, for the first time, as an event in its own right.<br/>11. At these Games, which took place in Antwerp, Belgium, fourteen nations competed.<br/>12. The competition lifts were the 'one hand' snatch, the 'one hand' clean and jerk and the 'two hands' clean and jerk.<br/>13. At the next Olympic Games, in Paris, France, in 1924, the 'two hands' press and the 'two hands' snatch were added to the programme, making a total of five lifts.<br/>14. In the Olympic Games after 1920, instead of requiring all competitors to compete against each other regardless of size, weight classes were introduced and, by the 1932 Olympic Games, weightlifting was divided into five weight divisions.<br/>15. In 1928, the sport dropped the 'one hand' exercises altogether leaving only the three remaining exercises: the clean and press, the snatch and the clean and jerk.<br/>16. By 1972, the clean and press was discontinued because athletes started to push with legs and bend backwards instead of strictly pressing the weight overhead, and this left the sole elements of what is today's modern Olympic weightlifting programme – the snatch and the clean and jerk.<br/>17. The snatch entails pulling with a very wide grip the barbell overhead without pressing out with the arms.<br/>18. It is a very precise lift that can be nullified by a lack of balance of the athlete.<br/>19. The clean and jerk is more forgiving using a narrower grip pull the bar to the shoulders and then using the strength of the legs push until arms reach full extension without a press out.<br/>20. <strike>A competition for women was introduced at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.As early as 1987, there were official world championships awarded to women weightlifters such as Karyn Marshall and Judy Glenney.</strike><br/>21. In 2011 the International Weightlifting Federation ruled that athletes could wear a full-body ""unitard"" under the customary weightlifting uniform.<br/>22. Kulsoom Abdullah became the first woman to do so at the U.S. National Championships that year, and athletes are allowed to do so at the Olympics.<br/>23. IWF rules previously stated that an athlete's knees and elbows must be visible so officials can determine if a lift is correctly executed.<br/>"
Olympic_weightlifting-Equipment,4,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Olympic weightlifting<br/>Section: Equipment<br/><br/>1. Olympic weightlifting uses a steel bar with rotating sleeves (also known as a barbell) which hold rubber-coated discs of different weights.<br/>2. The weight plates, typically referred to as ""bumper plates"" because of their rubber design, weigh between 0.5kg and 25kg.<br/>3. These plates are secured to the bar using collars on each sleeve that weigh exactly 2.5kg each.<br/>4. <strike>Lifters typically wear a one-piece, close-fitting leotard often called a singlet.</strike><br/>5. The wearing of a t-shirt underneath the singlet is optional.<br/>6. A weightlifting belt of 120mm maximum width may also be worn to provide lower back support.<br/>7. Perhaps the piece of equipment most peculiar to Olympic weightlifting are the shoes worn by lifters.<br/>8. Weightlifting shoes are typically designed with a raised heel of 0.5"" to 1.5"" and one or two metatarsal straps that tighten across the instep of the shoe.<br/>9. The shoes are designed for maximum stability while remaining flexible in the toebox.<br/>10. This allows the lifter to come up on their toes and catch the weight on the ball of their back foot during the ""jerk"" movement of their lift.<br/>11. The raised heel helps the lifter maintain an upright torso while catching the bar and also allows for a deeper squat under the bar.<br/>"

It was systematically taught in Japan after the Taisho era.<br/>4. In 1922 the Japanese Ministry of Education invited Gichin Funakoshi to Tokyo to give a karate demonstration.<br/>5. In 1924 Keio University established the first university karate club in Japan and by 1932, major Japanese universities had karate clubs.<br/>6. In this era of escalating Japanese militarism, the name was changed from (""Chinese hand"" or ""Tang hand"") to (""empty hand"") – both of which are pronounced ""karate"" – to indicate that the Japanese wished to develop the combat form in Japanese style.<br/>7. After World War II, Okinawa became an important United States military site and karate became popular among servicemen stationed there.The martial arts movies of the 1960s and 1970s served to greatly increase the popularity of martial arts around the world, and in English the word ""karate"" began to be used in a generic way to refer to all striking-based Oriental martial arts.<br/>8. Karate schools began appearing across the world, catering to those with casual interest as well as those seeking a deeper study of the art.Shigeru Egami, Chief Instructor of Shotokan Dojo, opined ""that the majority of followers of karate in overseas countries pursue karate only for its fighting techniques ... Movies and television ... depict karate as a mysterious way of fighting capable of causing death or injury with a single blow ... the mass media present a pseudo art far from the real thing.""<br/>9.

Often referred to as a 'good length' shot.<br/>4. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boast: The ball is played off a side wall at an angle, or the back wall, before hitting the front wall.<br/>5. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Volley: The ball is hit 'on the full' (before it touches the floor), usually directly to the front wall<br/>6. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drop shot: The ball is hit gently against the front wall, to fall softly to the floor in the front corner.<br/>7. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lob: The ball is hit softly and high on the front wall and with a high arc, so that it falls in a back corner of the court.<br/>8. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cross Court: The ball is hit to the front wall from the right side to the left (or vice versa).<br/>9. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kill: The ball is hit hard and low on the front wall so that it travels no farther than half court.<br/>10. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strike> Trickle boast: A 'short' boast where the ball is hit to the side wall at the front of the court (often disguised as a drive or drop shot).</strike><br/>11. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Squeeze boast: A more difficult shot which is hit from the front of the court when the ball is very close to the side wall.<br/>12. Has the same effect as the trickle boast but is more deceptive because of its difficulty.<br/>13. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nick shot: the ball is 'volleyed' or hit off a bounce to strike the front wall then the junction of the side wall and floor (the 'nick') giving the ball little or no bounce.<br/>14. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rolling nick shot: When the nick shot is hit extremely well, the ball will roll along the floor (this is a more advanced shot that is a variation of the kill shot).<br/>15. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back wall boast: the ball is hit moderately hard and high off the back wall, so that it goes the length of the room and hits (usually low) off the front wall.<br/>16. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Philadelphia (or corkscrew): A shot played diagonally upwards into the front corner hitting the front wall first and then the side wall.<br/>17. The ball then lobs over the court with significant spin.<br/>18. Ideally it hits the opposite side wall at the back and travels parallel to the rear wall making a return very difficult.<br/>19.

Such setups are usually symmetrical in layout.<br/>7. New riders normally set up their boards to be comfortable to ride with their ""natural"" foot forward, which does not allow for riding Switch without modifications.For best results and easy wakeboarding, this sport is normally done in lakes, though the intercoastal waterways are also becoming popular.<br/>"

Long-based fins release better, give the wakeboard a loose, snowboard-like feel when riding flat through the water, and they hold up better on rails and ramps.Moulded finsThese are just big channels in the board that act like fins and hold up on rails and ramps.<br/>4. Moulded fins are slippery, but most boards have a removable centre fin.Multi-finned set-upsThese capture the maximum edge hold and aggressiveness into the wake and through the wake.Canted side finsThese are fins that lean out on an angle.<br/>5. These fins are not as active when the wakeboard is riding flat through the water, but the more the rider leans on edge, the more the wakeboard hooks up.<br/>6. The inside fin digs while the outside lifts, creating leverage to help the wakeboard edge hard.<br/>7. Great for 50-50 grinds, nose presses and tail presses.Cupped side finsThey have the same effect as canted fins but add more of a push-pull effect.<br/>8. The cupped fin allows for the use of a smaller fin but still gets the hold of a bigger fin due to the increased surface area of the cupped side of the fin.<br/>9. These fins are very deceiving – they look small and loose but really aren’t.No FinsSome riders prefer to ride finless, as some boards are specifically designed for cable parks or other uses, some uses of which can benefit from a finless design.<br/>"

Netball-Abstract,11,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Netball<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. Netball is a ball sport played by two teams of seven players.<br/>2. Its development, derived from early versions of basketball, began in England in the 1890s.<br/>3. By 1960, international playing rules had been standardised for the game, and the International Federation of Netball and Women's Basketball (later renamed the International Netball Federation (INF)) was formed.<br/>4. As of 2011, the INF comprises more than 60 national teams organized into five global regions.Games are played on a rectangular court with raised goal rings at each end.<br/>5. Each team attempts to score goals by passing a ball down the court and shooting it through its goal ring.<br/>6. Players are assigned specific positions, which define their roles within the team and restrict their movement to certain areas of the court.<br/>7. During general play, a player with the ball can hold onto it for only three seconds before shooting for a goal or passing to another player.<br/>8. The winning team is the one that scores the most goals.<br/>9. Netball games are 60 minutes long.<br/>10. Variations have been developed to increase the game's pace and appeal to a wider audience.Netball is most popular in Commonwealth nations, specifically in schools, and is predominantly played by women.<br/>11. <strike>According to the INF, netball is played by more than 20 million people in more than 80 countries.</strike><br/>12. Major transnational competitions take place, including the Netball Superleague in Great Britain and the ANZ Championship in Australia and New Zealand.<br/>13. Three major competitions take place internationally: the quadrennial World Netball Championships, the Commonwealth Games, and the yearly World Netball Series.<br/>14. In 1995, netball became an International Olympic Committee recognised sport.<br/>"
Netball-Description_and_rules,5,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Netball<br/>Section: Description and rules<br/><br/>1. The objective of a game is to score more goals than the opposition.<br/>2. Goals are scored when a team member positioned in the attacking shooting circle shoots the ball through the goal ring.<br/>3. The goal rings are in diameter and sit atop -high goal posts that have no backboards.<br/>4. A -radius semi-circular ""shooting circle"" is an area at each end of the court.<br/>5. <strike>The goal posts are located within the shooting circle.</strike><br/>6. Each team defends one shooting circle and attacks the other.<br/>7. The netball court is long, wide, and divided lengthwise into thirds.<br/>8. The ball is usually made of leather or rubber, measures in circumference, and weighs .<br/>9. A normal game consists of four 15-minute quarters and can be played outdoors or in a covered stadium.Each team is allowed seven players on the court.<br/>10. Each player is assigned a specific position, which limits their movement to a certain area of the court.<br/>11. A ""bib"" worn by each player contains a two letter abbreviation of indicating this position.<br/>12. Only two positions are permitted in the attacking shooting circle, and can therefore shoot for a goal.<br/>13. Similarly, only two positions are permitted in the defensive shooting circle; they try to prevent the opposition from shooting goals.<br/>14. Other players are restricted to two thirds of the court, with the exception of the Centre, who may move anywhere on the court except for a shooting circle.At the beginning of every quarter and after a goal has been scored, play starts with a player in the centre position passing the ball from the centre of the court.<br/>15. These ""centre passes"" alternate between the teams, regardless of which team scored the last goal.<br/>16. When the umpire blows the whistle to restart play, four players from each team can move into the centre third to receive the pass.<br/>17. The centre pass must be caught or touched in the centre third.<br/>18. The ball is then moved up and down the court through passing and must be touched by a player in each adjacent third of the court.<br/>19. Players can hold the ball for only three seconds at any time.<br/>20. It must be released before the foot they were standing on when they caught it touches the ground again.<br/>21. Contact between players is only permitted if it does not impede an opponent or the general play.<br/>22. When defending a pass or shot players must be at least away from the player with the ball.<br/>23. If illegal contact is made, the player who contacted cannot participate in play until the player taking the penalty has passed or shot the ball.<br/>24. If the ball is held in two hands and either dropped or a shot at goal is missed, the same player cannot be the first to touch it unless it first rebounds off the goal.<br/>"
Croquet-Association,15,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Croquet<br/>Section: Association<br/><br/>1. Variations.Association.Association croquet is the name of an advanced game of croquet, played at international level.<br/>2. It involves four balls teamed in pairs, with both balls going through every hoop for one pair to win.<br/>3. The game's distinguishing feature is the ""croquet"" shot: when certain balls hit other balls, extra shots are allowed.<br/>4. The six hoops are arranged three at each end of the court, with a centre peg.In association croquet one side takes the black and blue balls, the other takes red and yellow.At each turn, players can choose to play with either of their balls for that turn.At the start of a turn, the player plays a stroke.<br/>5. If the player either hits the ball through the correct hoop (""runs"" the hoop), or hits another ball (a ""roquet""), the turn continues.Following a roquet, the player picks up his or her own ball and puts it down next to the ball that it hit.<br/>6. The next shot is played with the two balls touching: this is the ""croquet stroke"" from which the game takes its name.After the croquet stroke, the player plays a ""continuation"" stroke, during which the player may again attempt to make a roquet or run a hoop.<br/>7. Each of the other three balls may be roqueted once in a turn before a hoop is run, after which they become available to be roqueted again.The winner of the game is the team who completes the set circuit of six hoops (and then back again the other way), with both balls, and then strikes the centre peg (making a total of 13 points per ball = 26).Good players may make ""breaks"" of several hoops in a single turn.<br/>8. The best players may take a ball round a full circuit in one turn.<br/>9. ""Advanced play"" (a variant of association play for expert players) gives penalties to a player who runs certain hoops in a turn, to allow the opponent a chance of getting back into the game; feats of skill such as triple peels or better, in which the partner ball (or occasionally an opponent ball) is caused to run a number of hoops in a turn by the striker's ball help avoid these penalties.A handicap system ('bisques') provides less experienced players a chance of winning against more formidable opponents.<br/>10. Players of all ages and both sexes compete on level terms.The World Championships are organised by the World Croquet Federation (WCF) and usually take place every 2 or 3 years.<br/>11. The New Zealand team won the last MacRobertson International Croquet Shield tournament, which is the major international test tour trophy in association croquet.<br/>12. It is contested every three to four years between Australia, Great Britain, the United States and New Zealand.<br/>13. Historically the British have been the dominant force, winning 14 times out of the 20 times the event has been held.<br/>14. In individual competition, the UK is often divided by subnational country (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales).<br/>15. <strike>Unlike most sports, men and women compete and are ranked together.</strike><br/>16. As of 2013, the Association Croquet World Champion is Robert Fletcher of Australia and the Women's Association Croquet World Champion is Jenny Clarke of New Zealand.The world's top 10 association croquet players as of February 2014 are Robert Fletcher (Australia), Chris Clarke (New Zealand), Reg Bamford (South Africa), Paddy Chapman (New Zealand), Aaron Westerby (New Zealand), Greg Bryant (New Zealand), Toby Garrison (New Zealand), Robert Fulford (England), David Maugham (England), and Jamie Burch (England).Three women have won the British Open Championship: Lily Gower in 1905, Dorothy Steel in 1925, 1933, 1935 and 1936, and Hope Rotherham in 1960.<br/>17. While male players are in the majority at club level in the UK, the opposite is the case in Australia and New Zealand.The governing body in England is The Croquet Association, which has been the driving force of the development of the game.<br/>18. The rules and tournament regulations are now maintained by the International Laws Committee, established by the croquet associations of England and Wales (CA), Australia (ACA), New Zealand (CNZ) and the United States (USCA).<br/>"
Croquet-Garden,1,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Croquet<br/>Section: Garden<br/><br/>1. <strike>Garden croquet is widely played in the UK.</strike><br/>2.

The rules are similar to those described above for Association Croquet with three major differences:<br/>4. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The starting point for all balls is a spot three feet in from the boundary directly in front of hoop1.<br/>5. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a strikers ball goes off, there is no penalty, it comes back on three feet and the turn continues.<br/>6. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a croquet stroke the croqueted ball does not have to move when the strikers ball is struck.<br/><br/>7. This version of the game is easy for beginners to learn.</br>8. The main Garden Croquet Club in the UK is the Bygrave Croquet Club which is a private club with five lawns.<br/>9. Other clubs also use garden croquet as an introduction to the game, notably the Hampstead Heath Croquet Club and the Watford Croquet Club.<br/>"
Tug_of_war-Origins,1,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Tug of war<br/>Section: Origins<br/><br/>1. <strike>The origins of tug of war are uncertain, but it is beyond dispute that this once royal sport was practised in ancient Egypt, Greece and China, where it was held in legend that the Sun and Moon played Tug of War over the light and darkness.</strike><br/>2. It is also widely believed the sport was made popular in Great Britain by Lord Elliott Simpson, in the 16th Century.<br/>3. Simpson was a keen tugger.According to a Tang dynasty book, The Notes of Feng, tug of war, under the name ""hook pulling""(牵钩), was used by the military commander of the State of Chu during the Spring and Autumn Period (8th century BC to 5th century BC) to train warriors.<br/>4. During the Tang dynasty, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang promoted large-scale tug of war games, using ropes of up to 167 meters or (547.9 feet) with shorter ropes attached and more than 500 people on each end of the rope.<br/>5. Each side also had its own team of drummers to encourage the participants.In ancient Greece the sport was called ""helkustinda"" (Greek: ἑλκυστίνδα), ""efelkustinda"" (ἐφελκυστίνδα) and ""dielkustinda"" (διελκυστίνδα), which derives from ""dielkō"" (διέλκω), meaning amongst others ""I pull through"", all deriving from the verb ""helkō"" (ἕλκω), ""I draw, I pull"".<br/>6. ""Helkustinda"" and ""efelkustinda"" seem to have been ordinary versions of tug of war, while ""dielkustinda"" had no rope, according to Julius Pollux.<br/>7. It is possible that the teams held hands when pulling, which would have increased difficulty, since handgrips are more difficult to sustain than a grip of a rope.<br/>8. Tug of war games in ancient Greece were among the most popular games used for strength and would help build strength needed for battle in full armor.<br/>9. Archeological evidence shows that tug of war was also popular in India in 12th century AD:Tug of war stories about heroic champions from Scandinavia and Germany circulate Western Europe where Viking warriors pull animal skins over open pits of fire in tests of strength and endurance in preparation for battle and plunder.1500 and 1600 – tug of war is popularised during tournaments in French châteaux gardens and later in Great Britain1800 – tug of war begins a new tradition among seafaring men who were required to tug on lines to adjust sails while ships were under way and even in battle.The Mohave Indians occasionally used tug-of-war matches as means of settling disputes.The ""Oxford English Dictionary"" says that the phrase ""tug of war"" originally meant ""the decisive contest; the real struggle or tussle; a severe contest for supremacy"".<br/>10. Only in the 19th century was it used as a term for an athletic contest between two teams who haul at the opposite ends of a rope.<br/>"
Tug_of_war-Risk_of_Injury,14,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Tug of war<br/>Section: Risk of Injury<br/><br/>1. In addition to injuries from falling and back strains, (some of which may be serious), catastrophic injuries may result in the form of finger, hand or even arm amputations.<br/>2. Amputations or avulsions may result from two causes: looping or wrapping the rope around a hand or wrist, and from the elastic recoil of the broken rope if the rope breaks.<br/>3. Amateur organizers of tugs of war may underestimate the forces generated, or overestimate the breaking strength of common ropes, and may thus be unaware of the possible consequences if a rope parts in peoples' hands under tons of tension.<br/>4. The broken ends of an elastic polymer such as common nylon reach high speeds and can easily sever fingers.<br/>5. For this reason, specially engineered tug of war ropes exist that can withstand the forces generated.<br/>6. Some notable tug of war accidents include:<br/>7. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, June 13, 1978, rope parted, five teenagers lost fingers or fingertips, 200 other injuries.<br/>8. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chattanooga, Tennessee, June 9, 1995, a man had his hand torn off (avulsion) by sudden pull (his hand was in a loop).<br/>9. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taipei, Taiwan, October 25, 1997, rope parted, two men suffered arm amputations (details below).<br/>10. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Australia, September, 2002, 11-year-old boy had several fingers cut to the bone and nearly severed.<br/>11. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denver, Colorado, October 12, 2007, two teenage boys, rope looped around hands, suffered hand amputations.<br/>12. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Digby, Nova Scotia, October 25, 2010, rope looped around hand, man lost four fingers.<br/>13. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;El Monte, California, February 4, 2013, rope parted, teenage boy and girl each suffered multi-finger amputations.<br/>14. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strike>Budapest, Hungary, September 17, 2013, rope parted, seven student injured, three of them severely.</strike><br/>"
Scuba_diving-Diver_propulsion,4,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Scuba diving<br/>Section: Diver propulsion<br/><br/>1. Personal mobility is enhanced by fins and optionally diver propulsion vehicles.<br/>2. Fins have a large blade area and use the more powerful leg muscles, so are much more efficient for propulsion and manoeuvring thrust than arm and hand movements, but require skill to provide fine control.Streamlining dive gear will reduce drag and improve mobility.<br/>3. Balanced trim which allows the diver to align in any desired direction also improves streamlining by presenting the smallest section area to the direction of movement and allows propulsion thrust to be used more efficiently.Occasionally a diver may be towed using a ""sled"", an unpowered device towed behind a surface vessel which conserves the diver's energy and allows more distance to be covered for a given air consumption and bottom time.<br/>4. <strike>The depth is usually controlled by the diver by using diving planes or by tilting the whole sled.</strike><br/>5.

Scuba_diving-Nitrogen_narcosis,4,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Scuba diving<br/>Section: Nitrogen narcosis<br/><br/>1. Nitrogen narcosis or inert gas narcosis is a reversible alteration in consciousness producing a state similar to alcohol intoxication in divers who breathe high pressure gas at depth.<br/>2. The mechanism is similar to that of nitrous oxide, or ""laughing gas,"" administered as anesthesia.<br/>3. Being ""narced"" can impair judgment and make diving very dangerous.<br/>4. <strike>Narcosis starts to affect some divers at 66 feet (20 m).</strike><br/>5. At this depth, narcosis manifests itself as a slight giddiness.<br/>6. The effects increase drastically with the increase in depth.<br/>7. Almost all divers are able to notice the effects by 132 feet (40 meters).<br/>8. At these depths divers may feel euphoria, anxiety, loss of coordination and lack of concentration.<br/>9. At extreme depths, hallucinogenic reaction and tunnel vision can occur.<br/>10. Jacques Cousteau famously described it as the ""rapture of the deep"".<br/>11. Nitrogen narcosis occurs quickly and the symptoms typically disappear during the ascent, so that divers often fail to realize they were ever affected.<br/>12. It affects individual divers at varying depths and conditions, and can even vary from dive to dive under identical conditions.<br/>13. However, diving with trimix or heliox dramatically reduces the effects of inert gas narcosis.<br/>"
Snorkeling-The_snorkel,1,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Snorkeling<br/>Section: The snorkel<br/><br/>1. <strike>A swimmer's snorkel is a tube typically about long and with an inside diameter of between , usually L- or J-shaped and fitted with a mouthpiece at the lower end, and constructed of rubber or plastic.</strike><br/>2. It is used for breathing air from above the water surface when the wearer's mouth and nose are submerged.<br/>3. The snorkel usually has a piece of rubber that attaches the snorkel to the outside of the strap of the diving mask.<br/>4. An older technique is pushing the snorkel between the mask-strap and the head, but this practice increases the chances the mask will leak.The optimum design length of the snorkel tube is at most 40 centimeters (about 16 inches).<br/>5. A longer tube would not allow breathing when snorkelling deeper, since it would place the lungs in deeper water where the surrounding water pressure is higher.<br/>6. The lungs would then be unable to inflate when the snorkeler inhales, because the muscles that expand the lungs are not strong enough to operate against the higher pressure.Snorkels also constitute respiratory dead space.<br/>7. When the user takes in a fresh breath, some of the previously exhaled air which remains in the snorkel is recycled into the lungs, reducing breathing efficiency and causing a build up of carbon dioxide in the blood, which can result in hypercapnia.<br/>8. The greater the volume of the tube, and the smaller the tidal volume of breathing, the more this problem is exacerbated.<br/>9. A smaller diameter tube reduces the dead volume, but also increases resistance to airflow and so increases the work of breathing.<br/>10. Occasional exhalation through the nose while snorkeling will reduce the build up of carbon dioxide, and help in keeping the mask clear of water.<br/>"

One of them is the wicket-keeper ""aka"" ""keeper"" who operates behind the wicket being defended by the batsman on strike.<br/>3. <strike>Wicket-keeping is normally a specialist occupation and his primary job is to gather deliveries that the batsman does not hit, so that the batsmen cannot run byes.</strike><br/>4. He wears special gloves (he is the only fielder allowed to do so), a box over the groin, and pads to cover his lower legs.<br/>5. Owing to his position directly behind the striker, the wicket-keeper has a good chance of getting a batsman out caught off a fine edge from the bat.<br/>6. He is the only player who can get a batsman out stumped.Apart from the one currently bowling, the other nine fielders are tactically deployed by the team captain in chosen positions around the field.<br/>7. These positions are not fixed but they are known by specific and sometimes colourful names such as ""slip"", ""third man"", ""silly mid on"" and ""long leg"".<br/>8. There are always many unprotected areas.The captain is the most important member of the fielding side as he determines all the tactics including who should bowl (and how); and he is responsible for ""setting the field"", though usually in consultation with the bowler.In all forms of cricket, if a fielder gets injured or becomes ill during a match, a substitute is allowed to field instead of him.<br/>9.

Racquetballs are manufactured in a variety of colors such as blue, green, purple, black, red, and pink, and some are for specific purposes (e.g., outdoor play and indoor play), but the differences are unlikely to make much difference for recreational play.<br/>2. Beginners are recommended to use a blue ball by Penn, Ektelon, or Wilson.<br/>3. The blue ball is the most commonly used and it is the most neutral ball for average speed and accuracy of contact.<br/>4. Green balls are similar to blue balls.<br/>5. In the USA the main choices of ball are blue and green for tournament play.<br/>6. In some cases the International Pro Racquetball Tour (IRT) will use a purple Penn HD ball as the official ball.<br/>7. A black ball is often used in tournaments for senior players because the ball is designed to be slower moving and allows for longer rallies.<br/>8. <strike>The red ball is the fastest in production and they are known as Red Ektelon Fireballs.</strike><br/>9. This ball is heavier and allows for a quicker pace.<br/>10. The pink ball tends to be the favorite of most recreational players and even some pro level players.<br/>11. This pink ball allows for the highest level of visibility due to the bright pink color.<br/>12. Also, the speed and durability of the ball is very close to that of the blue and green.<br/>13. Finally, the pink ball was created to support breast cancer research and the manufacturers of the ball Wilson, donate $1.00 to the breast cancer awareness association every time a package is sold.Balls do break occasionally, and will lose their bounce over time even without breaking.<br/>14. To keep balls around for a long time it is best to keep them in a room temperature setting and keep them out of extreme cold or heat because this will cause the balls to become less effective and lose their bounce.<br/>"
Racquetball-Service,15,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Racquetball<br/>Section: Service<br/><br/>1. Shots of the game.Service.Serve style varies drastically from player to player.<br/>2. Generally, they are divided into two types: offensive and defensive.<br/>3. Most players use an offensive serve for the first serve, and a defensive serve if they need to hit a second serve.<br/>4. Of the offensive serves, the most common is the drive.<br/>5. The intention with this serve is for the ball to travel low and fast towards either back corner, and to bounce twice before striking either side wall or the back wall.<br/>6. If the opponent is adjusting to the drive serve, the server will throw in any variety of jam serves.A ""jam serve"" is an offensive serve which attempts to catch the opponent off balance by making use of difficult angles and unfrequented play space.<br/>7. The most common jam serve is the Z-serve, which strikes the front wall close to a side wall.<br/>8. The ball bounces quickly off the side wall, then strikes the floor and then the opposite side wall about 30–35 feet back.<br/>9. Depending upon the spin the server gives the Z-serve, the resulting carom may prove unpredictable and difficult to return.<br/>10. Side spin may cause the ball to bounce parallel to the back wall.A ""pinch serve"" is similar to a drive serve; however, the ball strikes a side wall very low and close to the serving box.<br/>11. With the appropriate spin, the ball has little bounce, and is difficult to return.<br/>12. It is possible that a successful serve would strike the sidewall before the short line, and land on the floor after the short line.If the player faults on the first serve, they will usually hit a defensive serve.<br/>13. Defensive serves do not usually garner aces, but they are designed to generate a weak return by the opponent, thereby setting up the server to win the point.<br/>14. Most defensive serves are any variety of lob serves.<br/>15. <strike>A plain lob serve is a ball hit with a long, high arch into either back corner.</strike><br/>16. The goal is to hit the ball so that it lands as close as possible to the back wall, giving the opponent very little room to hit a solid return.<br/>17. A junk lob takes a shallower arch, and lands close to the side wall somewhere between the dotted line and the back wall.<br/>18. This lob is intended to deceive the opponent into thinking he has an easy kill.<br/>19. However, since the ball is in the deep zone, it will more likely set up the server for an offensive shot.<br/>"
Ski_jumping-History,"2, 3","Category: Sport<br/>Title: Ski jumping<br/>Section: History<br/><br/>1. Ski jumping as a sport originated in Norway.<br/>2. <strike>Norwegian lieutenant Olaf Rye was the first known ski jumper.</strike><br/>3. <strike>In 1809, he launched himself 9.5 meters in the air as a show of courage to his fellow soldiers.</strike><br/>4. By 1862, ski jumpers were facing much larger jumps and traveling longer.<br/>5. The very first recorded public competition was held at Trysil, Norway, on 22 January 1862.<br/>6. At this first competition, judges already awarded points for style (""elegance and smoothness""), participants had to complete three jumps without falling and rules were agreed upon in advance.<br/>7. It is clear from the news report published in Morgenbladet that the ski jumping in Trysild was entertainment, but also a national, competitive sports event.<br/>8. The first known female ski jumper participated at the Trysil competition in 1863.<br/>9. Norway's Sondre Norheim jumped 30 meters without the benefit of poles.<br/>10. In 1866, the first skiing event held in Christiania near Old Aker Church was a combined cross country, slalom and jumping competition, and attracted an audience of some 2,000 people.<br/>11. Sondre Norheim won his first competition in Christiania in 1868.<br/>12. The first widely known ski jumping competition was the Husebyrennene, held in Oslo in 1879, with Olaf Haugann of Norway setting the first world record for the longest ski jump at 20 meters.<br/>13. Explorer Fridtjof Nansen was a skilled skier and was number 7 in the 1881 competition at Huseby.<br/>14. Until 1884–1886 jumping and cross-country was a single integrated competition: In 1886 at Huseby cross-country and jumping were held on separate days, and final results were calculated from the combined achievements (similar to present nordic combined).<br/>15. The annual event was moved to Holmenkollen from 1892, and Holmenkollen has remained the pinnacle of ski jumping venues.<br/>16. To distinguish ski jumping competition only from Nordic combined, it is still referred to as ""spesielt hopprenn"" in Norwegian (ski jumping only).According to the International Olympic Committee's site:Ski jumping has been part of the Olympic Winter Games since the first Games in Chamonix Mont-Blanc in 1924.<br/>17. The Large Hill competition was included on the Olympic programme for the 1964 Olympic Games in Innsbruck.In 1929, Norwegian instructors arrived in Sapporo to train the Japanese in ski jumping.<br/>"

In 1936, the FIS started to regulate the construction of the jumping hills and issued international standards for their construction and maintenance.<br/>4. Back then, it was forbidden to build a ski jumping hill which made it possible to make jumps longer than 80 meters.<br/>5. Nevertheless the first-ever ski flying hill was built in Planica, Slovenia.<br/>6. It took several more years before competitions on this hill were approved by FIS.<br/>7. The ""father"" of ski flying is Janez Gorišek, an engineer, sportsman and enthusiastic sport-promoter who designed the Planica ski-jump.There are five ski flying hills in the world today: Vikersundbakken in Vikersund, Norway; Oberstdorf, Germany; Kulm Austria; Letalnica, Planica, Slovenia; and Harrachov, Czech Republic.<br/>8. A sixth hill, Copper Peak in the western Upper Peninsula of Michigan, is currently disused, although there are plans to rebuild it to FIS standards.<br/>9. There are plans for more ski flying hills, even for an indoor ski flying hill in Ylitornio, Finland.<br/>10.

"Equestrianism-""Western""_riding",8,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Equestrianism<br/>Section: ""Western"" riding<br/><br/>1. Western riding evolved from the cattle-working and warfare traditions brought to the Americas by the Spanish Conquistadors, and both equipment and riding style evolved to meet the working needs of the cowboy on ranches in the American West.Though the differences between English and Western riding appear dramatic, there are more similarities than most people think.<br/>2. Both styles require riders to have a solid seat, with the hips and shoulders balanced over the feet, with hands independent of the seat so as to avoid disturbing the balance of the horse and interfering with its performance.The most noticeable feature of western style riding is in the saddle, which has a substantial tree that provides greater support to horse and rider when working long hours in the saddle.<br/>3. The western saddle features a prominent pommel topped by a horn (a knob used for dallying a lariat after roping an animal), a deep seat and a high cantle.<br/>4. The stirrups are wider and the saddle has rings and ties that allow objects to be attached to the saddle.Western horses are asked to perform with a loose rein, controlled by one hand.<br/>5. The standard western bridle lacks a noseband and usually consists of a single set of reins attached to a curb bit that has somewhat longer and looser shanks than the curb of an English Weymouth bridle or a pelham bit.<br/>6. Two styles of Western reins developed: The long split reins of the Texas tradition, which are completely separated, or the closed-end ""Romal"" reins of the California tradition, which have a long single attachment on the ends that can be used as a quirt.<br/>7. Modern rodeo competitors in timed events sometimes use a closed rein without a ""romal"".Western riders wear a long-sleeved shirt, denim jeans, boots, and a wide-brimmed cowboy hat.<br/>8. <strike>Cowboy boots, which have pointed toes and higher heels than a traditional riding boot, are designed to prevent the rider's foot from slipping through the stirrup during a fall, preventing the rider from being dragged—most western saddles have no safety bars for the leathers or automatic stirrup release mechanism.</strike><br/>9. A rider may wear protective leather leggings called chaps.<br/>10. Clean, well-fitting work clothing is the usual outfit seen in rodeo, cutting and reining competitions, especially for men, though sometimes both men and women wear brighter colors or finer fabrics for competition than for work.Show events such as Western pleasure use much flashier equipment, unlike the English traditions where clothing and tack is quiet and unobtrusive.<br/>11. Saddles, bits and bridles are ornamented with substantial amounts of silver.<br/>12. The rider may add a jacket or vest, and women's clothing in particular features vivid colors and even, depending on current fads, rhinestones or sequins.Western horses are asked to have a brisk, ground-covering walk, but a slow, relaxed jog trot that allows the rider to sit the saddle and not post.<br/>13. The Western version of the canter is called a ""lope"" and while collected and balanced, is expected to be slow and relaxed.<br/>14. Working western horses seldom use a sustained hand gallop, but must be able to accelerate quickly to high speed when chasing cattle or competing in rodeo speed events, must be able to stop quickly from a dead run and ""turn on a dime.""<br/>"
Curling-Abstract,4,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Curling<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. Curling is a sport in which players slide stones on a sheet of ice towards a target area which is segmented into four concentric rings.<br/>2. It is related to bowls, boules and shuffleboard.<br/>3. Two teams, each of four players, take turns sliding heavy, polished granite stones, also called ""rocks"", across the ice ""curling sheet"" towards the ""house"", a circular target marked on the ice.<br/>4. <strike>Each team has eight stones.</strike><br/>5. The purpose is to accumulate the highest score for a ""game""; points are scored for the stones resting closest to the centre of the house at the conclusion of each ""end"", which is completed when both teams have thrown all of their stones.<br/>6. A game may consist of ten or eight ends.The curler can induce a curved path by causing the stone to slowly turn as it slides, and the path of the rock may be further influenced by two sweepers with brooms who accompany it as it slides down the sheet, using the brooms to alter the state of the ice in front of the stone.<br/>7. A great deal of strategy and teamwork go into choosing the ideal path and placement of a stone for each situation, and the skills of the curlers determine how close to the desired result the stone will achieve.<br/>8. This gives curling its nickname of ""chess on ice"".<br/>"
Curling-Shoes,1,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Curling<br/>Section: Shoes<br/><br/>1. <strike>Curling shoes are similar to ordinary athletic shoes except that they have dissimilar soles; the ""slider shoe"" is designed for the off foot (or sliding foot) and the ""non-sliding shoe"" for the hack foot.The ""slider shoe"" is designed to slide and typically has a Teflon sole.</strike><br/>2. It is worn by the thrower during delivery from the hack and by sweepers or the skip to glide down the ice when sweeping or otherwise traveling down the sheet quickly.<br/>3. Stainless steel was once common for slider soles, and ""red brick"" sliders with lateral blocks of PVC on the sole are also available.<br/>4. Most shoes have a full-sole sliding surface, but some shoes have a sliding surface covering only the outline of the shoe and other enhancements with the full-sole slider.<br/>5. Some shoes have small disc sliders covering the front and heel portions or only the front portion of the foot, which allow more flexibility in the sliding foot for curlers playing with tuck deliveries.<br/>6. When a player is not throwing, the player's slider shoe can be temporarily rendered non-slippery by using a slip-on gripper.<br/>7. Ordinary athletic shoes may be converted to sliders by using a step-on or slip-on Teflon slider or by applying electrical or gaffer tape directly to the sole or over a piece of cardboard.<br/>8. This arrangement often suits casual or beginning players.The ""non-sliding shoe"", or ""hack foot shoe,"" is worn by the thrower on the hack foot during delivery and is designed to grip.<br/>9. It may have a normal athletic shoe sole or a special layer of rubbery material applied to the sole of a thickness to match the sliding shoe.<br/>10. The toe of the hack foot shoe may also have a rubberised coating on the top surface or a flap that hangs over the toe to reduce wear on the top of the shoe as it drags on the ice behind the thrower.<br/>"
Luge-Artificial_tracks,13,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Luge<br/>Section: Artificial tracks<br/><br/>1. Artificial luge tracks have specially-designed and -constructed banked curves plus walled-in straights.<br/>2. Most tracks are artificially refrigerated, but artificial tracks without artificial cooling also exist (for example, in St. Moritz).<br/>3. Tracks tend to be very smooth.The athletes ride in a flat, aerodynamic position on the sled, keeping their heads low to minimize air resistance.<br/>4. They steer the sled mainly with their calves by applying pressure on the runners--right calf to turn left, left calf to turn right.<br/>5. It takes a precise mix of shifting body weight, applying pressure with calves and rolling the shoulders.<br/>6. There are also handles for minor adjustments.<br/>7. A successful luger maintains complete concentration and relaxation on the sled while traveling at high speeds.<br/>8. Most lugers ""visualize"" the course in their minds before sliding.<br/>9. Fastest times result from following the perfect ""line"" down the track.<br/>10. Any slight error, such as a brush of the wall, costs time.<br/>11. Track conditions are also important.<br/>12. Softer ice tends to slow speeds, while harder ice tends to lead to faster times.<br/>13. <strike>Lugers race at speeds averaging 120–145 km/h (75–90 mph) around high banked curves while experiencing a centripetal acceleration of up to 5g.</strike><br/>14. Men's Singles have their start locations near where the bobsled and skeleton competitors start at most tracks, while both the Doubles and Women's Singles competition have their starthouse located further down the track.<br/>15. Artificial track luge is the fastest and most agile sledding sport.<br/>"
Luge-Training,3,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Luge<br/>Section: Training<br/><br/>1. The sport of luge requires an athlete to balance mental and physical fitness.<br/>2. To become an elite luger, a competitor must begin training at an early age and spend decades honing their skills.<br/>3. <strike>Physically, a luger must have strong neck, upper body, abdominal, and thigh muscles.</strike><br/>4. Strength training is essential to withstand the extreme G-forces of tight turns at high speeds.<br/>5. Since lugers have very little protection other than a visor and helmet, they must be able to endure the physical pounding administered by the track when mistakes are made.<br/>6. Mentally a luger must maintain total focus as they steer their sled through more than a kilometer of curves and straights at high speed.<br/>7. Dozens of subtle movements and weight shifts are required to find the perfect line down the track.<br/>8. Consistency is essential for success.<br/>9. Sled maintenance is also an important element for success.<br/>10. Serious lugers spend hours meticulously sanding their ""steels,"" and making other important adjustments and repairs to their sleds.<br/>11. No luger can possibly achieve elite status without working closely with an experienced coaching staff, implementing suggestions and fine tuning technique.<br/>12. Other lugers will often give tips that can improve a slider's ability to find the ""sweet spot"" on the track.<br/>13. Though luge is a winter sport, it requires daily, year-round training.<br/>"

In the 16th and 17th centuries, lamaseries were built throughout the country.<br/>5. Many of them started as ""ger""-temples.<br/>6. When they needed to be enlarged to accommodate the growing number of worshippers, the Mongolian architects used structures with 6 and 12 angles with pyramidal roofs to approximate to the round shape of a ""ger"".<br/>7. Further enlargement led to a quadratic shape of the temples.<br/>8.

Switzerland-Federal_state,10,"Category: Country<br/>Title: Switzerland<br/>Section: Federal state<br/><br/>1. The restoration of the power to the patriciate was only temporary.<br/>2. After a period of unrest with repeated violent clashes such as the Züriputsch of 1839, civil war broke out in 1847 when some of the Catholic cantons tried to set up a separate alliance (the ""Sonderbundskrieg"").<br/>3. The war lasted for less than a month, causing fewer than 100 casualties, most of which were through friendly fire.<br/>4. However minor the Sonderbundskrieg seems to be when compared with other European riots and wars in the 19th century, it nevertheless had a major impact on both the psychology and the society of the Swiss and of Switzerland.The war convinced most Swiss of the need for unity and strength towards its European neighbours.<br/>5. Swiss people from all strata of society, whether Catholic or Protestant, from the liberal or conservative current, realised that the cantons would profit more if their economic and religious interests were merged.Thus, while the rest of Europe saw revolutionary uprisings, the Swiss drew up a constitution which provided for a federal layout, much of it inspired by the American example.<br/>6. This constitution provided for a central authority while leaving the cantons the right to self-government on local issues.<br/>7. Giving credit to those who favoured the power of the cantons (the Sonderbund Kantone), the national assembly was divided between an upper house (the Swiss Council of States, 2 representatives per canton) and a lower house (the National Council of Switzerland, representatives elected from across the country).<br/>8. Referenda were made mandatory for any amendment of this constitution.A system of single weights and measures was introduced and in 1850 the Swiss franc became the Swiss single currency.<br/>9. Article 11 of the constitution forbade sending troops to serve abroad, though the Swiss were still obliged to serve Francis II of the Two Sicilies with Swiss Guards present at the Siege of Gaeta in 1860, marking the end of foreign service.An important clause of the constitution was that it could be re-written completely if this was deemed necessary, thus enabling it to evolve as a whole rather than being modified one amendment at a time.This need soon proved itself when the rise in population and the Industrial Revolution that followed led to calls to modify the constitution accordingly.<br/>10. <strike>An early draft was rejected by the population in 1872 but modifications led to its acceptance in 1874.</strike><br/>11. It introduced the facultative referendum for laws at the federal level.<br/>12.

The more mountainous southern half of the country is far more sparsely populated than the northern half.<br/>4. In the largest Canton of Graubünden, lying entirely in the Alps, population density falls to 27 /km² (70 /sq mi).Switzerland lies between latitudes 45° and 48° N, and longitudes 5° and 11° E. It contains three basic topographical areas: the Swiss Alps to the south, the Swiss plateau or middleland, and the Jura mountains on the north.<br/>5. The Alps are a high mountain range running across the central-south of the country, comprising about 60% of the country's total area.<br/>6. Among the high valleys of the Swiss Alps many glaciers are found, totalling an area of 1,063 square kilometres.<br/>7. From these originate the headwaters of several major rivers, such as the Rhine, Inn, Ticino and Rhône, which flow in the four cardinal directions into the whole of Europe.<br/>8.

In the southeast the long Engadin Valley, encompassing the St. Moritz area in canton Graubünden, is also well known; the highest peak in the neighbouring Bernina Alps is Piz Bernina ().The more populous northern part of the country, comprising about 30% of the country's total area, is called the Middle Land.<br/>15. It has greater open and hilly landscapes, partly forested, partly open pastures, usually with grazing herds, or vegetables and fruit fields, but it is still hilly.<br/>16. There are large lakes found here and the biggest Swiss cities are in this area of the country.<br/>17.

Belgium-Religion,7,"Category: Country<br/>Title: Belgium<br/>Section: Religion<br/><br/>1. Since the country's independence, Roman Catholicism, counterbalanced by strong freethought movements, has had an important role in Belgium's politics.<br/>2. However Belgium is largely a secular country as the ""laicist"" constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the government generally respects this right in practice.<br/>3. During the reigns of Albert I and Baudouin, the monarchy had a reputation of deeply rooted Catholicism.Roman Catholicism has traditionally been Belgium's majority religion; being especially strong in Flanders.<br/>4. However, by 2009 Sunday church attendance was 5% for Belgium in total; 3% in Brussels, and 5.4% in Flanders.<br/>5. Church attendance in 2009 in Belgium was roughly half of the Sunday church attendance in 1998 (11% for the total of Belgium in 1998).<br/>6. Despite the drop in church attendance, Catholic identity nevertheless remains an important part of Belgium's culture.Symbolically and materially, the Roman Catholic Church remains in a favourable position.<br/>7. <strike>Belgium has three officially recognized religions: Christianity (Catholic, Protestantism, Orthodoxy and Anglicanism), Islam and Judaism.In the early 2000s there were approximately 42,000 Jews in Belgium.</strike><br/>8. The Jewish Community of Antwerp (numbering some 18,000) is one of the largest in Europe, and one of the last places in the world where Yiddish is the primary language of a large Jewish community (mirroring certain Orthodox and Hassidic communities in New York and Israel).<br/>9. In addition most Jewish children in Antwerp receive a Jewish education.<br/>10. There are several Jewish newspapers and more than 45 active synagogues (30 of which are in Antwerp) in the country.A 2006 inquiry in Flanders, considered to be a more religious region than Wallonia, showed that 55% considered themselves religious and that 36% believed that God created the universe.<br/>11. On the other hand, Wallonia has become one of Europe's most secular/least religious regions.<br/>12. Most of the French-speaking region's population does not consider religion an important part of their lives, and as much as 45% of the population identifies as irreligious.<br/>13. This is particularly the case in eastern Wallonia and areas along the French border.A 2008 estimate found that 6% of the Belgian population, about 628,751, is Muslim (98% Sunni), while a 2011 estimate claims 1,000,000 inhabitants of Muslim background in the country.<br/>14. Muslims constitute 30–35% of the population of Brussels, 4.0% of Wallonia and 3.9% of Flanders.<br/>15. The majority of Belgian Muslims live in the major cities, such as Antwerp, Brussels and Charleroi.<br/>16. The largest group of immigrants in Belgium are Moroccans, with 400,000 people.<br/>17. The Turks are the third largest group, and the second largest Muslim ethnic group, numbering 220,000.According to the Eurobarometer Poll in 2010, 37% of Belgian citizens responded that ""they believe there is a God"", whereas 31% answered that ""they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force"" and 27% that ""they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force"".<br/>"

At the same time a movement to make Magnus King of Sweden proved successful.<br/>3. (At this time both the kings of Sweden and of Denmark were elected to the throne by their respective nobles.)<br/>4. Thus, with his election to the throne of Sweden, both Sweden and Norway were united under King Magnus VII.In 1349, the Black Death radically altered Norway, killing between 50% and 60% of its population and leaving it in a period of social and economic decline.<br/>5. The plague left Norway very poor.<br/>6. Although the death rate was comparable with the rest of Europe, economic recovery took much longer because of the small, scattered population.<br/>7. Before the plague, the population was only about 500,000 people.<br/>8. After the plague, many farms lay idle while the population slowly increased.<br/>9. The few surviving farms' tenants found their bargaining positions with their landlords greatly strengthened.King Magnus VII ruled Norway until 1350, when his son, Haakon, was placed on the throne as Haakon VI.<br/>10. In 1363, Haakon VI married Margaret, the daughter of King Valdemar IV of Denmark.<br/>11. Upon the death of Haakon VI, in 1379, his son, Olaf IV, was only 10 years old.<br/>12. Olaf had already been elected to the throne of Denmark on 3 May 1376.<br/>13. Thus, upon Olaf's accession to the throne of Norway, Denmark and Norway entered personal union.<br/>14. Olaf's mother and Haakon's widow, Queen Margaret, managed the foreign affairs of Denmark and Norway during the minority of Olaf IV.Margaret was working toward a union of Sweden with Denmark and Norway by having Olaf elected to the Swedish throne.<br/>15. She was on the verge of achieving this goal when Olaf IV suddenly died.<br/>16. However, Denmark made Margaret temporary ruler upon the death of Olaf.<br/>17. <strike>On 2 February 1388 Norway followed suit and crowned Margaret.Queen Margaret knew that her power would be more secure if she were able to find a king to rule in her place.</strike><br/>18. She settled on Eric of Pomerania, grandson of her sister.<br/>19. Thus at an all-Scandinavian meeting held at Kalmar, Erik of Pomerania was crowned king of all three Scandinavian countries.<br/>20.

Present day Petronell-Carnuntum in Eastern Austria was an important army camp turned capital city in what became known as the Upper Pannonia province.<br/>4. Carnuntum was home for 50,000 people for nearly 400 years.After the fall of the Roman Empire the area was invaded by Bavarians, Slavs and Avars.<br/>5. Charlemagne conquered the area in AD 788, encouraged colonisation and introduced Christianity.<br/>6. As part of Eastern Francia, the core areas that now encompass Austria were bequeathed to the house of Babenberg.<br/>7.

The ancient Persians were present in the region from about the 9th century BCE, and became rulers of a large empire under the Achaemenid dynasty in the 6th century BCE.<br/>20. The ruins of Persepolis and Pasargadae, two of the four capitals of the Achaemenid Empire, are located in or near Shiraz.<br/>21.

It shares a 530-kilometer border with Saudi Arabia on the west, south, and southeast, and a 450-kilometer border with Oman on the southeast and northeast.<br/>3. The land border with Qatar in the Khawr al Udayd area is about nineteen kilometers () in the northwest; however, it is a source of ongoing dispute.<br/>4. Following Britain's military departure from UAE in 1971, and its establishment as a new state, the UAE laid claim to islands resulting in disputes with Iran that remain unresolved.<br/>5. UAE also disputes claim on other islands against the neighboring state of Qatar.The largest emirate, Abu Dhabi, accounts for 87% of the UAE's total area ().<br/>6.

Most of the coast consists of salt pans that extend far inland.<br/>8. The largest natural harbor is at Dubai, although other ports have been dredged at Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and elsewhere.<br/>9. Numerous islands are found in the Persian Gulf, and the ownership of some of them has been the subject of international disputes with both Iran and Qatar.<br/>10. The smaller islands, as well as many coral reefs and shifting sandbars, are a menace to navigation.<br/>11. Strong tides and occasional windstorms further complicate ship movements near the shore.<br/>12. The UAE also has a stretch of the Al Bāţinah coast of the Gulf of Oman, although the Musandam Peninsula, the very tip of Arabia by the Strait of Hormuz is an exclave of Oman separated by the UAE.South and west of Abu Dhabi, vast, rolling sand dunes merge into the Rub al-Khali (Empty Quarter) of Saudi Arabia.<br/>13. The desert area of Abu Dhabi includes two important oases with adequate underground water for permanent settlements and cultivation.<br/>14. The extensive Liwa Oasis is in the south near the undefined border with Saudi Arabia.<br/>15. About to the northeast of Liwa is the Al-Buraimi oasis, which extends on both sides of the Abu Dhabi-Oman border.<br/>16. Lake Zakher is a man-made lake near the border with Oman.Prior to withdrawing from the area in 1971, Britain delineated the internal borders among the seven emirates in order to preempt territorial disputes that might hamper formation of the federation.<br/>17. In general, the rulers of the emirates accepted the British intervention, but in the case of boundary disputes between Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and also between Dubai and Sharjah, conflicting claims were not resolved until after the UAE became independent.<br/>18. The most complicated borders were in the Al-Hajar al-Gharbi Mountains, where five of the emirates contested jurisdiction over more than a dozen enclaves.<br/>"

The Education Index lists Denmark 16th in 2011 based on mean years of schooling (of adults) and expected years of schooling (of children).Primary school is known as the folkeskole.<br/>5. Attendance at primary school is not compulsory, but most Danish children go to primary school for 10 years, from the age of 6 to 16.<br/>6. Whilst attending a primary school is not compulsory, receiving education at primary school-level is and must be provided for nine years.<br/>7. There are no final exams, but pupils in primary schools can choose to go to a test when finishing ninth grade.<br/>8. The test is obligatory if further education is to be attended.<br/>9. Pupils can alternatively attend a private independent school (), or a private school () – schools that are not under the administration of the municipalities, such as Christian schools or Waldorf schools.Following graduation from primary school, there are several educational opportunities; the Gymnasium (STX) attaches importance in teaching a mix of humanities and science, Higher Technical Examination Programme (HTX) focuses on scientific subjects and the Higher Commercial Examination Programme emphasizes on subjects in economics.<br/>10. Higher Preparatory Examination (HF) is similar to ""Gymnasium (STX)"", but is one year shorter.For specific professions, there is the vocational education, training young people for work in specific trades by a combination of teaching and apprenticeship.Danish universities and other higher education institutions offer international students a range of opportunities for obtaining an internationally recognised qualification in Denmark.<br/>11.

While Danish art was influenced over the centuries by trends in Germany and the Netherlands, the 15th- and 16th-century church frescos, which can be seen in many of the country's older churches, are of particular interest as they were painted in a style typical of native Danish painters.The Danish Golden Age, which began in the first half of the 19th century, was inspired by a new feeling of nationalism and romanticism.<br/>2. <strike>Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg was not only a productive artist in his own right but taught at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts where his students included notable painters such as Wilhelm Bendz, Christen Købke, Martinus Rørbye, Constantin Hansen, and Wilhelm Marstrand.</strike><br/>3. The sculpture of Bertel Thorvaldsen was also significant during this period.In 1871, Holger Drachmann and Karl Madsen visited Skagen in the far north of Jutland where they quickly built up one of Scandinavia's most successful artists' colonies specializing in Naturalism and Realism rather than in the traditional approach favoured by the Academy.<br/>4. Hosted by Michael and his wife Anna, they were soon joined by P.S.<br/>5. Krøyer, Carl Locher and Laurits Tuxen.<br/>6. All participated in painting the natural surroundings and local people.<br/>7. Similar trends developed on Funen with the ""Fynboerne"" who included Johannes Larsen, Fritz Syberg and Peter Hansen, and on the island of Bornholm with the Bornholm school of painters including Niels Lergaard, Kræsten Iversen and Oluf Høst.Danish photography has developed from strong participation and interest in the very beginnings of the art in 1839 to the success of a considerable number of Danes in the world of photography today.<br/>8. Pioneers such as Mads Alstrup and Georg Emil Hansen paved the way for a rapidly growing profession during the last half of the 19th century while both artistic and press photographers made internationally recognised contributions.<br/>9. Today Danish photographers such as Astrid Kruse Jensen and Jacob Aue Sobol are active both at home and abroad, participating in key exhibitions around the world.Collections of modern art enjoy unusually attractive settings at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art north of Copenhagen and at the North Jutland Art Museum in Aalborg.<br/>10.

Both Chinese and Indian associations have submitted memorandums to the government, accusing it of formulating an undemocratic culture policy.Some cultural disputes exist between Malaysia and neighbouring countries, notably Indonesia.<br/>10. The two countries have a similar cultural heritage, sharing many traditions and items.<br/>11. However, disputes have arisen over things ranging from culinary dishes to Malaysia's national anthem.<br/>12. Strong feelings exist in Indonesia about protecting their national heritage.<br/>13.

Singapore-History,12,"Category: Country<br/>Title: Singapore<br/>Section: History<br/><br/>1. Temasek ('sea town'), a second century outpost of the Sumatran Srivijaya empire, is the earliest known settlement on Singapore.<br/>2. The island was part of the Sri Vijaya Empire when it was invaded by the south Indian Emperor Rajendra Chola I of the Chola Empire in the 11th century.<br/>3. In 1613, Portuguese raiders burned down the settlement and the island sank into obscurity for the next two centuries.<br/>4. Nominally, it belonged to the Johor Sultanate during this period.In 1819, Thomas Stamford Raffles arrived and signed a treaty with Sultan Hussein Shah of Johor on behalf of the British East India Company to develop the southern part of Singapore as a British trading post.<br/>5. In 1824, the entire island became a British possession under a further treaty with the Sultan and the Temenggong.<br/>6. In 1826, Singapore became part of the Straits Settlements, under the jurisdiction of British India, becoming the regional capital in 1836.<br/>7. Before Raffles arrived, there were approximately 1,000 people living on the island, mostly indigenous Malays along with a handful of Chinese.<br/>8. By 1860, the population exceeded 80,000 and more than half was Chinese.<br/>9. Many immigrants came to work at rubber plantations and, after the 1870s, the island became a global centre for rubber exports.During World War II, the Imperial Japanese Army invaded British Malaya, culminating in the Battle of Singapore.<br/>10. The British were defeated, and surrendered on 15 February 1942.<br/>11. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill called this ""the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history"".<br/>12. <strike>The Sook Ching massacre of ethnic Chinese after the fall of Singapore claimed between 5,000 and 25,000 lives.</strike><br/>13. The Japanese occupied Singapore until the British repossessed it in September 1945, after the Surrender of Japan.Singapore's first general election in 1955 was won by David Marshall, the pro-independence leader of the Labour Front.<br/>14. He led a delegation to London to demand complete self-rule but was turned down by the British.<br/>15. He subsequently resigned and was replaced by Lim Yew Hock, whose policies convinced Britain to grant Singapore full internal self-government for all matters except defence and foreign affairs.During the May 1959 elections, the People's Action Party won a landslide victory.<br/>16. Singapore became an internally self-governing state within the Commonwealth and Lee Kuan Yew became the country's first Prime Minister.<br/>17. Governor Sir William Allmond Codrington Goode served as the first Yang di-Pertuan Negara (""Head of State""), and was succeeded by Yusof bin Ishak who became the first President of Singapore in 1965.<br/>18. During the 1950s, Chinese Communists with strong ties to the trade unions and Chinese schools carried out an armed uprising against the government, leading to the Malayan Emergency and later, the Communist Insurgency War.<br/>19.

Singapore has been consistently rated among the least corrupt countries in the world by Transparency International.Executive power rests with the Cabinet of Singapore, led by the Prime Minister and, to a much lesser extent, the President.<br/>5. The President is elected through a popular vote, and has veto powers over a specific set of executive decisions, such as the use of the national reserves and the appointment of judges, but otherwise occupies a largely ceremonial post.The Parliament serves as the legislative branch of the government.<br/>6. Members of Parliament (MPs) consist of elected, non-constituency and nominated members.<br/>7. Elected MPs are voted into the Parliament on a ""first-past-the-post"" (plurality) basis and represent either single-member or group-representation constituencies.<br/>8. The People's Action Party has won control of Parliament with large majorities in every election since self-governance was secured in 1959.<br/>9. However, in the most recent Parliamentary elections in 2011, the opposition, led by the Workers' Party, made material gains, increasing its representation to six elected MPs.The legal system of Singapore is based on English common law, but with substantial local differences.<br/>10. <strike>Trial by jury was abolished in 1970 so that judicial decisions would rest entirely in the hands of appointed judges.</strike><br/>11.

Israel also took control of the Sinai Peninsula, but returned it to Egypt as part of the 1979 Israel–Egypt Peace Treaty.<br/>3. Between 1982 and 2000, Israel occupied part of southern Lebanon, in what was known as the Security Zone.Following Israel's capture of these territories and until this day, settlements (Jewish civilian communities) and military installations were built within each of them.<br/>4. Israel applied civilian law to the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem, incorporating them into its sovereign territory and granting their inhabitants permanent residency status and the choice to apply for citizenship.<br/>5. In contrast, the West Bank has remained under military occupation, and Palestinians in this area cannot become citizens.<br/>6. The Gaza Strip is independent of Israel with no Israeli military or civilian presence, but Israel continues to maintain control of its airspace and waters.<br/>7. The UN Security Council has declared the annexation of the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem to be ""null and void"" and continues to view the territories as occupied.<br/>8. The International Court of Justice, principal judicial organ of the United Nations, asserted, in its 2004 advisory opinion on the legality of the construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier, that the lands captured by Israel in the Six-Day War, including East Jerusalem, are occupied territory.The status of East Jerusalem in any future peace settlement has at times been a difficult hurdle in negotiations between Israeli governments and representatives of the Palestinians, as Israel views it as its sovereign territory, as well as part of its capital.<br/>9. Most negotiations relating to the territories have been on the basis of United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, which emphasises ""the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war"", and calls on Israel to withdraw from occupied territories in return for normalization of relations with Arab states, a principle known as ""Land for peace"".The West Bank was annexed by Jordan in 1950, following the Arab rejection of the UN decision to create two states in Palestine.<br/>10. Only Britain recognized this annexation and Jordan has since ceded its claim to the territory to the PLO.<br/>11. The West Bank was occupied by Israel in 1967 during the Six-Day War.<br/>12. The population are mainly Palestinians, including refugees of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.<br/>13. From their occupation in 1967 until 1993, the Palestinians living in these territories were under Israeli military administration.<br/>14. Since the Israel–PLO letters of recognition, most of the Palestinian population and cities have been under the internal jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, and only partial Israeli military control, although Israel has on several occasions redeployed its troops and reinstated full military administration during periods of unrest.<br/>15. In response to increasing attacks as part of the Second Intifada, the Israeli government started to construct the Israeli West Bank barrier.<br/>16. When completed, approximately 13% of the Barrier will be constructed on the Green Line or in Israel with 87% inside the West Bank.The Gaza Strip was occupied by Egypt from 1948 to 1967 and then by Israel after 1967.<br/>17. <strike>In 2005, as part of Israel's unilateral disengagement plan, Israel removed all of its settlers and forces from the territory.</strike><br/>18.

Gaza has a border with Egypt and an agreement between Israel, the European Union and the PA governed how border crossing would take place (it was monitored by European observers).<br/>22.

Finland-Parliament,8,"Category: Country<br/>Title: Finland<br/>Section: Parliament<br/><br/>1. The 200-member unicameral Parliament of Finland exercises supreme legislative authority.<br/>2. It may alter the constitution and ordinary laws, dismiss the cabinet, and override presidential vetoes.<br/>3. Its acts are not subject to judicial review; the constitutionality of new laws is assessed by the parliament's constitutional law committee.<br/>4.

Various parliament committees listen to experts and prepare legislation.<br/>6. The speaker is currently Eero Heinäluoma (Social Democrats).Since universal suffrage was introduced in 1906, the parliament has been dominated by the Centre Party (former Agrarian Union), the National Coalition Party (conservatives), and the Social Democrats.<br/>7.

For a few decades after 1944, the Communists were a strong fourth party.<br/>10. Due to the electoral system of proportional representation, and the relative reluctance of voters to switch their support between parties, the relative strengths of the parties have commonly varied only slightly from one election to another.<br/>11. However, there have been some long-term trends, such as the rise and fall of the Communists during the Cold War; the steady decline into insignificance of the Liberal party and its predecessors from 1906 to about 1980; and the rise of the Green party and its predecessor since 1983.<br/>12. In the 2011 elections, the True Finns achieved exceptional success, increasing its representation from 5 to 39 seats, and thus surpassing the Centre Party.The autonomous province of Åland, which forms a federacy with Finland, elects one member to the parliament, who traditionally joins the parliamentary group of the Swedish People's Party of Finland.<br/>13.

Greece-Medieval_period_(4th_century–1453),10,"Category: Country<br/>Title: Greece<br/>Section: Medieval period (4th century–1453)<br/><br/>1. Medieval period (4th century–1453).The Roman Empire in the east, following the fall of the Empire in the west in the 5th century, is conventionally known as the Byzantine Empire (but was simply called ""Roman Empire"" in its own time) and lasted until 1453.<br/>2. With its capital in Constantinople, its language and literary culture was Greek and its religion was predominantly Eastern Orthodox Christian.From the 4th century, the Empire's Balkan territories, including Greece, suffered from the dislocation of the ""Barbarian Invasions"".<br/>3. The raids and devastation of the Goths and Huns in the 4th and 5th centuries and the Slavic invasion of Greece in the 7th century resulted in a dramatic collapse in imperial authority in the Greek peninsula.<br/>4. Following the Slavic invasion, the imperial government retained control of only the islands and coastal areas, particularly cities such as Athens, Corinth and Thessalonica, while some mountainous areas in the interior held out on their own and continued to recognize imperial authority.<br/>5. Outside of these areas, a limited amount of Slavic settlement is generally thought to have occurred, although on a much smaller scale than previously thought.The Byzantine recovery of lost provinces began toward the end of the 8th century and most of the Greek peninsula came under imperial control again, in stages, during the 9th century.<br/>6. This process was facilitated by a large influx of Greeks from Sicily and Asia Minor to the Greek peninsula, while at the same time many Slavs were captured and re-settled in Asia Minor and those that remained were assimilated.<br/>7. During the 11th and 12th centuries the return of stability resulted in the Greek peninsula benefiting from strong economic growth – much stronger than that of the Anatolian territories of the Empire.Following the Fourth Crusade and the fall of Constantinople to the ""Latins"" in 1204 most of Greece quickly came under Frankish rule (initiating the period known as the ""Frankokratia"") or Venetian rule in the case of some of the islands.<br/>8. The re-establishment of the Byzantine Empire in Constantinople in 1261 was accompanied by the recovery of much of the Greek peninsula, although the Frankish Principality of Achaea in the Peloponnese remained an important regional power into the 14th century, while the islands remained largely under Genoese and Venetian control.In the 14th century much of the Greek peninsula was lost by the Empire as first the Serbs and then the Ottomans seized imperial territory.<br/>9. By the beginning of the 15th century, the Ottoman advance meant that Byzantine territory in Greece was limited mainly to the Despotate of the Morea in the Peloponnese.<br/>10. <strike>After the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453, the Morea was the last remnant of the Byzantine Empire to hold out against the Ottomans.</strike><br/>11. However, this, too, fell to the Ottomans in 1460, completing the Ottoman conquest of mainland Greece.<br/>12. With the Turkish conquest, many Byzantine Greek scholars, who up until then were largely responsible for preserving Classical Greek knowledge, fled to the West, taking with them a large body of literature and thereby significantly contributing to the Renaissance.<br/>"

According to other sources, 15.8% of Greeks describe themselves as ""very religious"", which is the highest among all European countries.<br/>5. The survey also found that just 3.5% never attend a church, compared to 4.9% in Poland and 59.1% in the Czech Republic.Estimates of the recognized Greek Muslim minority, which is mostly located in Thrace, range from 98,000 to 140,000, (between 0.9% and 1.2%) while the immigrant Muslim community numbers between 200,000 and 300,000.<br/>6. Albanian immigrants to Greece are usually associated with the Muslim religion, although most are secular in orientation.<br/>7. Following the 1919–1922 Greco-Turkish War and the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, Greece and Turkey agreed to a population transfer based on cultural and religious identity.<br/>8. About 500,000 Muslims from Greece, predominantly Turks, but also other Muslims, were exchanged with approximately 1,500,000 Greeks from Asia Minor (now Turkey).Judaism has existed in Greece for more than 2,000 years.<br/>9. <strike>Sephardi Jews used to have a large presence in the city of Thessaloniki (by 1900, some 80,000, or more than half of the population, were Jews), but nowadays the Greek-Jewish community who survived German occupation and the Holocaust, during World War II, is estimated to number around 5,500 people.Greek citizens who are Roman Catholic are estimated to be at around 50,000 with the Roman Catholic immigrant community in the country approximately 200,000.</strike><br/>10.

History.Ancient history.At Ain Hanech region (Saïda Province), early remnants (200,000 BC) of hominid occupation in North Africa were found.<br/>2. Neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the Levalloisian and Mousterian styles (43,000 BC) similar to those in the Levant.Algeria was the site of the highest state of development of Middle Paleolithic Flake tool techniques.<br/>3. Tools of this era, starting about 30,000 BC, are called Aterian (after the archeological site of Bir el Ater, south of Tebessa).The earliest blade industries in North Africa are called Iberomaurusian (located mainly in Oran region).<br/>4. This industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the Maghreb between 15,000 and 10,000 BC.<br/>5. Neolithic civilization (animal domestication and agriculture) developed in the Saharan and Mediterranean Maghrib between 6000 and 2000 BC.<br/>6. This life, richly depicted in the Tassili n'Ajjer paintings, predominated in Algeria until the classical period.The amalgam of peoples of North Africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that came to be called Berbers, who are the indigenous peoples of northern Africa.From their principal center of power at Carthage, the Carthaginians expanded and established small settlements along the North African coast; by 600 BC, a Phoenician presence existed at Tipasa, east of Cherchell, Hippo Regius (modern Annaba) and Rusicade (modern Skikda).<br/>7. These settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages.As Carthaginian power grew, its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically.<br/>8. Berber civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and political organization supported several states.<br/>9. Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others.By the early 4th century BC, Berbers formed the single largest element of the Carthaginian army.<br/>10. In the Revolt of the Mercenaries, Berber soldiers rebelled from 241 to 238 BC after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the First Punic War.<br/>11. They succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthage's North African territory, and they minted coins bearing the name Libyan, used in Greek to describe natives of North Africa.<br/>12. The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the Punic Wars.In 146 BC the city of Carthage was destroyed.<br/>13. As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew.<br/>14. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged.<br/>15. Two of them were established in Numidia, behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage.<br/>16. West of Numidia lay Mauretania, which extended across the Moulouya River in modern day Morocco to the Atlantic Ocean.<br/>17. The high point of Berber civilization, unequaled until the coming of the Almohads and Almoravids more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of Massinissa in the 2nd century BC.After Masinissa's death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times.<br/>18. Massinissa's line survived until 24 AD, when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the Roman Empire.For several centuries Algeria was ruled by the Romans, who founded many colonies in the region.<br/>19. Like the rest of North Africa, Algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire, exporting cereals and other agricultural products.<br/>20.

Corruption in Venezuela is high by world standards, and was so for much of the 20th century.<br/>2. <strike>The discovery of oil had worsened political corruption, and by the late 1970s, Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso's description of oil as ""the Devil's excrement"" had become a common expression in Venezuela.</strike><br/>3. Venezuela has been ranked one of the most corrupt countries on the Corruption Perceptions Index since the survey started in 1995.<br/>4. The 2010 ranking placed Venezuela at number 164, out of 178 ranked countries.This corruption is shown with Venezuela's significant involvement in drug trafficking, with Colombian cocaine and other drugs transiting Venezuela towards the United States and Europe.<br/>5. Venezuela ranks fourth in the world for cocaine seizures, behind Colombia, the United States, and Panama.<br/>6. In 2006 the government's agency for combating the Illegal drug trade in Venezuela, ""ONA"", was incorporated into the office of the Vice-President of the country.<br/>7. However, many major government and military officials have been known for their involvement with drug trafficking; especially with the October 2013 incident of men from the Venezuelan National Guard placing 1.3 tons of cocaine on a Paris flight knowing they will not face charges.Venezuela is among the most violent places on Earth.<br/>8. In Venezuela, a person is murdered every 21 minutes.<br/>9. Violent crimes have been so prevalent in Venezuela that the government no longer produces the crime data.<br/>10. In 2013, the homicide rate was approximately 79 per 100,000, one of the world’s highest, having quadrupled in the past 15 years with over 200,000 people murdered.<br/>11. The country's body count of the previous decade mimics that of the Iraq War and in some instances had more civilian deaths even though the country is at peacetime.<br/>12. The capital Caracas has one of the greatest homicide rates of any large city in the world, with 122 homicides per 100,000 residents.<br/>13. In 2008, polls indicated that crime was the number one concern of voters.Venezuela is especially dangerous toward foreign travelers and investors who are visiting.<br/>14. This is due to the nation's class struggle and poor economy that is devoid of needed foreign currency.<br/>15. The United States State Department and Government of Canada has warned foreign visitors that they may be subjected to robbery, kidnapping for a ransom or sale to terrorist organizations and murder, and that their own diplomatic travelers are required to travel in armored vehicles.<br/>16. The United Kingdom's Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advised against all travel to Venezuela.<br/>17. Visitors have been murdered during robberies and criminals do not discriminate against their victims.<br/>18. Recently, former Miss Venezuela 2004 winner Monica Spear and her husband were murdered with her 5 year old daughter being shot while visiting, and an elderly German tourist was murdered only a few weeks later.There are approximately 33 prisons holding about 50,000 inmates.<br/>19.

The Andes Mountains run parallel to the Pacific Ocean; they define the three regions traditionally used to describe the country geographically.<br/>4. The ""costa"" (coast), to the west, is a narrow plain, largely arid except for valleys created by seasonal rivers.<br/>5. The ""sierra"" (highlands) is the region of the Andes; it includes the ""Altiplano"" plateau as well as the highest peak of the country, the Huascarán.<br/>6. <strike>The third region is the ""selva"" (jungle), a wide expanse of flat terrain covered by the Amazon rainforest that extends east.</strike><br/>7. <strike>Almost 60 percent of the country's area is located within this region.Most Peruvian rivers originate in the peaks of the Andes and drain into one of three basins.</strike><br/>8. Those that drain toward the Pacific Ocean are steep and short, flowing only intermittently.<br/>9. Tributaries of the Amazon River are longer, have a much larger flow, and are less steep once they exit the ""sierra"".<br/>10. Rivers that drain into Lake Titicaca are generally short and have a large flow.<br/>11. Peru's longest rivers are the Ucayali, the Marañón, the Putumayo, the Yavarí, the Huallaga, the Urubamba, the Mantaro, and the Amazon.Peru does not have an exclusively tropical climate; the influence of the Andes and the Humboldt Current cause great climatic diversity within the country.<br/>12. The ""costa"" has moderate temperatures, low precipitations, and high humidity, except for its warmer, wetter northern reaches.<br/>13. In the ""sierra"", rain is frequent during summer, and temperature and humidity diminish with altitude up to the frozen peaks of the Andes.<br/>14. The ""selva"" is characterized by heavy rainfall and high temperatures, except for its southernmost part, which has cold winters and seasonal rainfall.<br/>15.

Peru-Culture,7,"Category: Country<br/>Title: Peru<br/>Section: Culture<br/><br/>1. Peruvian culture is primarily rooted in Amerindian and Spanish traditions, though it has also been influenced by various Asian, African, and other European ethnic groups.<br/>2. Peruvian artistic traditions date back to the elaborate pottery, textiles, jewelry, and sculpture of Pre-Inca cultures.<br/>3. The Incas maintained these crafts and made architectural achievements including the construction of Machu Picchu.<br/>4. Baroque dominated colonial art, though modified by native traditions.During this period, most art focused on religious subjects; the numerous churches of the era and the paintings of the Cuzco School are representative.<br/>5. Arts stagnated after independence until the emergence of ""Indigenismo"" in the early 20th century.<br/>6. Since the 1950s, Peruvian art has been eclectic and shaped by both foreign and local art currents.Peruvian literature is rooted in the oral traditions of pre-Columbian civilizations.<br/>7. <strike>Spaniards introduced writing in the 16th century; colonial literary expression included chronicles and religious literature.</strike><br/>8. After independence, Costumbrism and Romanticism became the most common literary genres, as exemplified in the works of Ricardo Palma.<br/>9. The early 20th century's ""Indigenismo"" movement was led by such writers as Ciro Alegría and José María Arguedas.<br/>10. César Vallejo wrote modernist and often politically engaged verse.<br/>11. Modern Peruvian literature is recognized thanks to authors such as Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa, a leading member of the Latin American Boom.Peruvian cuisine blends Amerindian and Spanish food with strong influences from Chinese, African, Arab, Italian, and Japanese cooking.<br/>12. Common dishes include ""anticuchos"", ""ceviche"", and ""pachamanca"".<br/>13. Peru's varied climate allows the growth of diverse plants and animals good for cooking.<br/>14. Peru's diversity of ingredients and cooking techniques is receiving worldwide acclaim.Peruvian music has Andean, Spanish, and African roots.<br/>15. In pre-Hispanic times, musical expressions varied widely in each region; the ""quena"" and the ""tinya"" were two common instruments.<br/>16. Spaniards introduced new instruments, such as the guitar and the harp, which led to the development of crossbred instruments like the ""charango"".<br/>17. African contributions to Peruvian music include its rhythms and the ""cajón"", a percussion instrument.<br/>18. Peruvian folk dances include marinera, tondero, zamacueca, diablada and huayno.<br/>"

The anonymous author describes the first as Vlach.<br/>4. Another voivodeship, ruled by Gyula, was mentioned in the 11th century.<br/>5. A Russian chronicle writes of a plundering raid in 1059 against Transylvania by Cumans and Vlachs.<br/>6. An Old Bulgarian inscription from 1176 attests the existence of a župan Dimitri who ruled over Dobruja in 943.In the Middle Ages, Romanians lived in three distinct principalities: Wallachia ( – ""The Romanian Land""), Moldavia () and Transylvania ().<br/>7. By the 11th century, Transylvania had become a largely autonomous part of the Kingdom of Hungary.<br/>8. It was independent as the Principality of Transylvania from the 16th century until 1711.In Wallachia and Moldavia, many small local states with varying degrees of independence developed.<br/>9. Only in the 14th century did the larger principalities of Wallachia (1310) and Moldavia (around 1352) emerge to fight the threat of the Ottoman Empire.<br/>10. Both territories inhabited by Romanians achieved their independence from the Hungarian Crown after military conflicts (Battle of Posada, 1330) or social conflicts (Moldavian boyars' revolt against Hungary, 1364) — these historic events being initiated by Basarab I of Wallachia (1310–1352) and Bogdan I of Moldavia (1359–1365).By 1541, the entire Balkan peninsula and most of Hungary had become Ottoman provinces.<br/>11. Moldavia, Wallachia, and Transylvania were under Ottoman suzerainty, preserving partial or full internal autonomy until the mid-19th century (Transylvania until 1699).<br/>12. During this period, in the Romanian lands the feudal system slowly disappeared.<br/>13. A few rulers of territories in what is now Romania distinguished themselves: these rulers include Stephen the Great, Vasile Lupu, and Dimitrie Cantemir in Moldavia; Matei Basarab, Vlad the Impaler, and Constantin Brâncoveanu in Wallachia; and John Hunyadi (""Ioannes Corvinus"") and Gabriel Bethlen in Transylvania.In 1600, the principalities of Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania were simultaneously headed by the Wallachian prince Michael the Brave (""Mihai Viteazul""), but the chance for a lasting unification was lost after Mihai was assassinated only one year later.<br/>14. <strike>After his death, as vassal tributary states, Moldavia and Wallachia had complete internal autonomy and external independence, which they finally lost in the 18th century.In 1699, Transylvania became a territory of the Habsburgs' Austrian empire following the Austrian victory over the Turks in the Great Turkish War.</strike><br/>15.

""American Hustle"" does not attempt to directly document the events of Abscam.<br/>3. The names are changed, and the film begins with the on-screen message, ""Some of this actually happened"".<br/>4. Major departures from reality include:<br/>5. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the film, Irving Rosenfeld begins a life of criminality when he smashes storefront windows as a child in order to provide more work for his father's glass-installation business.<br/>6. In real life, Melvin Weinberg began working for his father only as an adult.<br/>7. He did smash windows at that point, and according to one article after Abscam was revealed, it was indeed done to shore up business for Weinberg's father.<br/>8. A later report, however, states that it was done at the behest of the local union, to punish businesses who used non-union glaziers.<br/>9. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the film, Camden mayor Carmine Polito is shown as a selfless politician who gets involved in the scam only to provide jobs to his constituents; Irving feels so bad for Carmine that he engineers a reduced sentence for him.<br/>10. <strike>In reality, though Camden mayor Angelo Errichetti was widely praised for caring about the people of Camden, he also had a reputation for committing crimes.</strike><br/>11. During the Abscam operation, he offered to get the fake sheikh into illegal businesses such as money counterfeiting and drug smuggling.<br/>12. Though Weinberg developed a fondness for Errichetti as a man who ""didn't beat around the bush"", he made no attempt to protect Errichetti from prosecution.<br/>13. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evelyn Knight, Weinberg's mistress on whom the character of Sydney Prosser is based, was involved in Weinberg's scams, though to a lesser extent than shown in the film; and she was not involved in Abscam.<br/>14. She was also English, not an American impersonating an Englishwoman as shown in the film.<br/>15. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weinberg's wife Cynthia Marie Weinberg, the basis for Rosalyn Rosenfeld, is not known to have had an affair with someone from the mafia, nor did she nearly blow Weinberg's cover.<br/>16. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The character of Richie DiMaso is based to some extent on federal agent Tony Amoroso, although in real life Amoroso was just one of a number of agents involved in setting up and executing the scam.<br/>17. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the film, the sheikh is impersonated by a Mexican-American FBI agent with very limited Arabic.<br/>18. In real life, the sheikh was played by two different agents: first briefly by an American, Mike Denehy, who spoke no Arabic, then by a Lebanese-American.<br/>"

Wary of pirate activity off the coast of Somalia, the captain orders strict security precautions on the vessel and carries out practice drills.During a drill, the vessel is chased by Somali pirates in two skiffs; Phillips succeeds in outrunning them when one gives up after hearing Phillips on the radio calling for immediate military air support (a bluff) and the other loses engine power while trying to gain speed under the rough water Captain Phillips created.<br/>3. The next day one of the skiffs, fitted with two outboard engines, returns with four heavily armed pirates led by Abduwali Muse (Barkhad Abdi); they are carrying a ladder they had hastily welded the night before.<br/>4.

The_Act_of_Killing-Synopsis,1,"Category: Movies<br/>Title: The Act of Killing<br/>Section: Synopsis<br/><br/>1. <strike>The film focuses on the Indonesian killings of 1965–1966, an anti-communist purge in which more than 500,000 people were killed.</strike><br/>2. When Suharto overthrew Sukarno, the President of Indonesia, following the failed coup of the 30 September Movement in 1965, the gangsters Anwar Congo and Adi Zulkadry in Medan (North Sumatra) were promoted from selling black market movie theatre tickets to leading the most notorious death squad in North Sumatra.<br/>3. They also extorted ethnic Chinese locals, killing those who refused to pay.<br/>4. Anwar personally killed approximately 1,000 people, usually by strangling with wire.Today, Anwar is revered as a founding father of the right-wing paramilitary organization Pemuda Pancasila that grew out of the death squads.<br/>5. The organization is so powerful that its leaders include government ministers, and they are happy to boast about everything from corruption and election rigging to clearing out peasants for land developers and genocide.<br/>6. A regime was founded on crimes against humanity, yet has never been held accountable.Invited by Oppenheimer, Anwar and his friends eagerly re-enact the killings for the cameras, and make dramatic scenes depicting their memories and feelings about the killings.<br/>7. The scenes are produced in the style of their favorite film genres: gangster, western, and musical.<br/>8. Various aspects of Anwar and his friends' filmmaking process are shown, but as they begin to dramatize Anwar's own nightmares, the fiction scenes begin to take over the film's form, leading the film to become increasingly surreal and nightmarish.<br/>9. Oppenheimer has called the result ""a documentary of the imagination"".While some of Anwar's friends realize that the killings were wrong, others worry about the consequences of the story on their public image.<br/>10. Younger members of Pemuda Pancasila argue that they should boast about the horror of the massacres, because their terrifying and threatening force is the basis of their power today.After Anwar plays a victim, he cannot continue.<br/>11. He says that he feels what his victims have felt.<br/>12. Oppenheimer, from behind the camera, points out that it was much worse for the victims, because they knew they were going to be killed, whereas Anwar was only acting.<br/>13. Anwar then expresses doubts over whether he has sinned or not, tearfully saying he does not want the memories of what he did to come back to him.<br/>14. He revisits the rooftop where he claims many of his killings took place, and gags repeatedly.<br/>15. The dancers from the film's theatrical poster are seen before the credits begin to roll.<br/>"

Silvestri said, ""I've worked on films where there have been a number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film, but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world and it's a very different situation.<br/>3. It's very challenging to look for a way to give everyone the weight and consideration they need, but at the same time the film is really about the coming together of these characters, which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers which really has to be representative of all of them together.""<br/>4. Silvestri developed the score with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London, England.<br/>5. Whedon said, ""The score is very old-fashioned, which is why was letter-perfect for this movie because he can give you the heightened emotion, the [Hans Zimmer school of 'I'm just feeling a lot right now!'<br/>6. but he can also be extraordinarily cue and character specific, which I love.<br/>7.

Reception.Critical reaction.Todd McCarthy of ""The Hollywood Reporter"" gave a positive review of the film, remarking, ""It's clamorous, the save-the-world story is one everyone's seen time and again, and the characters have been around for more than half a century in 500 comic book issues.<br/>2. But Whedon and his cohorts have managed to stir all the personalities and ingredients together so that the resulting dish, however familiar, is irresistibly tasty again.""<br/>3. To ""Rolling Stone"" journalist Peter Travers, the film epitomized an exceptional blockbuster.<br/>4. ""It's also the blockbuster,"" Travers said, ""I saw in my head when I imagined a movie that brought together the idols of the Marvel world in one shiny, stupendously exciting package.<br/>5. It's ""Transformers"" with a brain, a heart and a working sense of humor.""<br/>6. Justin Chang of ""Variety"" wrote, ""Like a superior, state-of-the-art model built from reconstituted parts, Joss Whedon's buoyant, witty and robustly entertaining superhero smash-up is escapism of a sophisticated order, boasting a tonal assurance and rich reserves of humor that offset the potentially lumbering and unavoidably formulaic aspects of this 143-minute team-origin story.""<br/>7. Kenneth Turan of the ""Los Angeles Times"" complimented the film's frenetic pace, while Roger Ebert of the ""Chicago Sun-Times"" commented that it ""provides its fans with exactly what they desire.<br/>8. Whether it is exactly what they deserve is arguable"".<br/>9. Conversely, A. O. Scott of ""The New York Times"" believed that ""while ""The Avengers"" is hardly worth raging about, its failures are significant and dispiriting.<br/>10. The light, amusing bits cannot overcome the grinding, hectic emptiness, the bloated cynicism that is less a shortcoming of this particular film than a feature of the genre.<br/>11. ""The performances of several cast members was a frequent topic in the critiques.<br/>12. <strike>In particular, Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of Dr. Bruce Banner/the Hulk was well-received by commentators.</strike><br/>13. Joe Neumaier opined that his performance was superior to the rest of the cast; ""Ruffalo is the revelation, turning Banner into a wry reservoir of calm ready to become a volcano.""<br/>14. Similarly, ""The New Yorker"" Anthony Lane proclaimed Ruffalo's acting to be one of the film's highlights—alongside Downey.<br/>15. ""The Village Voice"" Karina Longworth concluded: ""Ruffalo successfully refreshes the Hulk myth, playing Banner as an adorably bashful nerd-genius who, in contrast to the preening hunks on the team, knows better than to draw attention to himself.""<br/>16. Travers asserted that the actor resonated a ""scruffy warmth and humor"" vibe, while Turan felt that he surpassed predecessors Edward Norton and Eric Bana in playing the character.<br/>17. Owen Gleiberman of ""Entertainment Weekly"" wrote that ""the smartest thing the filmmakers did was to get Mark Ruffalo to play Bruce Banner as a man so sensitive that he's at war, every moment, with himself.<br/>18. (The film finally solves the Hulk problem: He's a lot more fun in small doses.<br/>19. )""Referring to Downey, Joe Morgenstein of ""The Wall Street Journal""—despite complimenting Downey's performance—favored his work in ""Iron Man"" over his acting in ""The Avengers"": ""His Iron Man is certainly a team player, but Mr. Downey comes to the party with two insuperable superpowers: a character of established sophistication—the industrialist/inventor Tony Stark, a sharp-tongued man of the world—and his own quicksilver presence that finds its finest expression in self-irony.""<br/>20. Neumaier praised Evans, stating that he accurately conveyed his character's internal conflicts.Commentators appreciated the character development and dialogue.<br/>21. Associated Press reviewer Christy Lemire wrote that the script ""sparkles as brightly as the special effects; these people may be wearing ridiculous costumes but they're well fleshed-out underneath.""<br/>22. Scott suggested that certain parts of the film permeated a charm that he felt was similar to the western film ""Rio Bravo"" (1959).<br/>23. Longworth felt that while Whedon's script demonstrated the backstory of the characters, the film does not explore it ""in a substantive way"".<br/>"

Working from a hidden underground facility, senior technicians Gary Sitterson and Steve Hadley initiate plans for a mysterious ritual – reportedly one of several others taking place around the world.<br/>2. Also present is specialist Wendy Lin, who discloses that a similar operation undertaken by their Swedish counterparts has just ended in failure.Meanwhile, American college students Dana Polk, Holden McCrea, Marty Mikalski, Jules Louden, and Curt Vaughan are spending their weekend at a seemingly deserted cabin in the forest.<br/>3. It soon becomes clear that Sitterson and Hadley are manipulating this setting from afar, even intoxicating the teenagers with psychotropic drugs that gradually hinder rational thinking while increasing libido.<br/>4. After the door to the cabin's darkened cellar swings open on its own during a tipsy game of ""Truth or Dare"", for example, both technicians coerce their charges into investigating the contents within.The group soon uncovers a plentiful assortment of bizarre articles, including an old diary once maintained by Patience Buckner, onetime cabin resident abused by her sadistic family.<br/>5. Dana, who takes an interest in Patience, subsequently recites incantations from the journal and inadvertently summons the zombified Buckner clan.<br/>6. Leaving Dana, Holden, and Marty behind with the book, Curt and Jules retire outside – where Hadley successfully induces them to have sex.<br/>7. Set upon by marauding Buckners, Jules is decapitated but Curt escapes, sounding the alarm.<br/>8. Marty, a frequent marijuana smoker, becomes justifiably paranoid, declaring that unseen figureheads have been toying with their crisis.<br/>9. Locating concealed surveillance equipment, he theorizes that the predicament may be a gimmick for reality television before being dragged off to be killed by Judah Buckner.Terrified, Curt, Holden, and Dana attempt escape in their RV, though Sitterson triggers a tunnel collapse, rendering the highway impassable.<br/>10. Curt jumps a ravine on his motorcycle in a desperate bid to reach an adjoining road, but is killed crashing into a camouflaged force shield - apparently erected by the technicians.<br/>11. His demise convinces Dana that Marty's concerns may have been founded.Veering off the tarmac, the RV plummets into a nearby lake after Father Buckner surfaces inside and stabs Holden.<br/>12.

Dana observes a cenobite-like creature clutching a globe she observed in the cabin's cellar, indicating that the items there dictate which monster will be unleashed on its concurrent occupants.<br/>18. She and Marty are cornered by a private security team, but before they can be captured, manage to release the monsters, which run rampant throughout and slaughter the Facility's staff, including Hadley.<br/>19. Sitterson escapes, only to be inadvertently stabbed by Dana in the lower levels of the building.Upon entering an underground temple, the two survivors meet the project Director who explains that every year worldwide rituals commence to appease malevolent beings identified only as ""Ancient Ones"" living beneath the Facility, they are kept in perpetual slumber through an annual pars pro toto sacrifice of five young people embodying certain archetypes: the Whore (Jules), the Athlete (Curt), the Scholar (Holden), the Fool (Marty), and the Virgin (Dana).<br/>20. The order in which intended victims perish is flexible, as long as the Whore is first and the Virgin is last (or optionally survives, so long as the others die).<br/>21. The Director urges Dana to shoot Marty, completing the ritual, but they are interrupted by a werewolf which Marty fends off after it attacked Dana.<br/>22. Patience Buckner arrives, killing the Director, and Marty pushes them into a chasm.Dana and Marty accept that it might be better for another species to take humanity's place if this is the price of its continued existence.<br/>23.

Luc Dardenne said that he and his brother Jean-Pierre had for a long time had the idea of a film about ""a woman who helps a boy emerge from the violence that holds him prisoner.""<br/>2. Writing the screenplay took one year including a few breaks.<br/>3. In the earliest drafts, the character Samantha was a doctor and not a hairdresser.<br/>4. The script was structured with a fairytale in mind, where the boy would lose his illusions and Samantha would appear as a fairy-like figure.<br/>5. By not explaining much about the characters' past and psychology, the brothers aimed to avoid sentimentality.<br/>6. Throughout the writing process the brothers strove to maintain a strong clarity in the overall work and to avoid gloom, which is why the brothers, according to Jean-Pierre, decided to omit ""any form of vulgarity in the teenagers' language, even though they're street criminals.<br/>7. ""The film is a co-production with 46% investment from its directors' Belgian company Les Films du Fleuve, 44% from its French Archipel 35, and 10% from Italy's Lucky Red.<br/>8. It received further funding from the CNC, Eurimages, Wallimage, Radio Télévision Belge de la Communauté Française, and the Belgian French Community.Cécile de France was offered the role of Samantha soon after the screenplay was finished, as the brothers believed she would be able to portray the kindness of the character with her body and face alone.<br/>9. <strike>For the casting of the boy, Cyril, the production team held around 100 auditions.</strike><br/>10.

The_Dark_Knight_Rises-Abstract,15,"Category: Movies<br/>Title: The Dark Knight Rises<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. The Dark Knight Rises is a 2012 British-American epic superhero film directed by Christopher Nolan, who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan Nolan and the story with David S. Goyer.<br/>2. Featuring the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the final installment in Nolan's ""Batman"" film trilogy, and it is the sequel to ""Batman Begins"" (2005) and ""The Dark Knight"" (2008).<br/>3. Christian Bale reprises the lead role of Bruce Wayne/Batman, with a returning cast of his allies: Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth, Gary Oldman as James Gordon, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox.<br/>4. The film introduces Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), a sly, morally ambiguous cat burglar, and Bane (Tom Hardy), a mercenary bent on destroying Gotham City.<br/>5. Drawn back into action by new threats facing the city, an older Bruce Wayne is forced to come out of retirement and become Batman once again.Christopher Nolan was initially hesitant about returning to the series for a second time, but agreed to come back after developing a story with his brother and Goyer that he felt would conclude the series on a satisfactory note.<br/>6. Nolan drew inspiration from Bane's comic book debut in the 1993 """" storyline, the 1986 series ""The Dark Knight Returns"", and the 1999 storyline ""No Man's Land"".<br/>7. Filming took place in various locations, including Jodhpur, London, Nottingham, Glasgow, Los Angeles, New York City, Newark, and Pittsburgh.<br/>8. Nolan used IMAX cameras for much of the filming, including the first six minutes of the film, to optimize the quality of the picture.<br/>9. A variation of the Batplane termed ""The Bat"", an underground prison set, and a new Batcave set were created specifically for the film.<br/>10. As with ""The Dark Knight"", viral marketing campaigns began early during production to help promotion.<br/>11. When filming concluded, Warner Bros. refocused its campaign: developing promotional websites, releasing the first six minutes of the film, screening theatrical trailers, and sending out information regarding the film's plot.<br/>12. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" premiered in New York City on July 16, 2012.<br/>13. The film was released in Australia and New Zealand on July 19, 2012, and in North America and the United Kingdom on July 20, 2012.<br/>14. Upon release it received a favorable critical response and grossed over $1.081 billion worldwide.<br/>15. <strike>It is currently the ninth-highest-grossing film of all time, the third-highest-grossing film of 2012, and the third-highest-grossing superhero film of all time.</strike><br/>"
The_Dark_Knight_Rises-Production_design,12,"Category: Movies<br/>Title: The Dark Knight Rises<br/>Section: Production design<br/><br/>1. Concept artist Tully Summers commented on Nolan's style of cinematography when asked about the difference between his designs for this film and fantasy-based designs for ""Men in Black 3"": ""The difference for me was Christopher Nolan's visual style.<br/>2. One of the things that makes his Batman movies so compelling is their tone of plausibility.<br/>3. He will often prefer a raw, grittier design over one that is very sleek and product design pretty.<br/>4. It's sort of a practical military aesthetic.<br/>5. This stuff is made to work, not impress shoppers.<br/>6. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a war film.""<br/>7. Producer Emma Thomas stated this Batman film has a different visual aesthetic from the first two Nolan-directed features, explaining that ""it's meant to be winter in Gotham, so that right there is going to lend a whole different look to the film.<br/>8. ""The film introduces a vehicle that has been compared with the Batplane, dubbed ""the Bat"".<br/>9. In designing the Bat, Nathan Crowley approached it as if it were an actual military project, emphasising the need for it to ""fit into the same family"" as the Tumbler and the Batpod.<br/>10. The final version of the Bat takes its design cues from the Harrier Jump Jet, Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey and the Boeing AH-64 Apache.<br/>11. Chris Corbould described the Bat's size and shape as presenting a major challenge for filming given Christopher Nolan's emphasis on practical effects over computer-generated imagery.<br/>12. <strike>In order to make the Bat ""fly"", it was variously supported by wires, suspended from cranes and helicopters, and mounted on a purpose-built vehicle with hydraulic controls to simulate movement.When designing the Batcave set, Crowley and fellow production designer Kevin Kavanaugh hit upon the idea of flooding the Batcave and having Batman's equipment, the Batsuit and a supercomputer rise from the water.</strike><br/>13. Another set was designed at Cardington as an ""underground prison"", a rough-hewn labyrinth of stone cells in a vast abyss with a vertical shaft leading to the surface.<br/>14. Exteriors above the prison were filmed in Jodhpur, India, chosen because the ""forbidding landscape added to the desolation"".<br/>"
High_Renaissance-Overview,2,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: High Renaissance<br/>Section: Overview<br/><br/>1. Since the late eighteenth century, the High Renaissance has been taken to refer to a short (c. 30-year) period of exceptional artistic production in the Italian states, principally Rome, capital of the Papal States, under Pope Julius II.<br/>2. <strike>Assertions about where and when the period begins and ends vary, but in general the best-known exponents of painting of the High Renaissance, include Leonardo da Vinci, early Michelangelo and Raphael.</strike><br/>3. Extending the general rubric of Renaissance culture, the visual arts of the High Renaissance were marked by a renewed emphasis upon the classical tradition, the expansion of networks of patronage, and a gradual attenuation of figural forms into the style later termed Mannerism.The paintings in the Vatican by Michelangelo and Raphael are said by some scholars such as Stephen Freedberg to represent the culmination of High Renaissance style in painting, because of the ambitious scale of these works, coupled with the complexity of their composition, closely observed human figures, and pointed iconographic and decorative references to classical antiquity, can be viewed as emblematic of the High Renaissance.<br/>4. In more recent years, art historians have characterised the High Renaissance as a movement as opposed to a period, one amongst several different experimental attitudes towards art in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century.<br/>5. This movement is variously characterised as conservative; as reflecting new attitudes towards beauty; a deliberate process of synthesising eclectic models, linked to fashions in literary culture; and reflecting new preoccupations with interpretation and meaning .<br/>"

High Renaissance sculpture was normally commissioned by the public and the state, this becoming more popular for sculpture is an expensive art form.<br/>3. Sculpture was often used to decorate or embellish architecture, normally within courtyards where others were able to study and admire the commissioned art work.<br/>4. <strike>Wealthy individuals like cardinals, rulers and bankers were the more likely private patrons along with very wealthy families; Pope Julius II also patronized many artists.</strike><br/>5. During the High Renaissance there was the development of small scale statuettes for private patrons, the creation of busts and tombs also developing.<br/>6. The subject matter related to sculpture was mostly religious but also with a significant strand of classical individuals in the form of tomb sculpture and paintings as well as ceilings of cathedrals.<br/>"
Mexican_muralism-Antecedents,18,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Mexican muralism<br/>Section: Antecedents<br/><br/>1. Mexico has had a tradition of painting murals, starting with the Olmec civilization in the pre Hispanic period and into the colonial period, with murals mostly painted to evangelize and reinforce Christian doctrine.<br/>2. The modern tradition has its roots in the 19th century, with this use of political and social themes.<br/>3. The first Mexican mural painter to use philosophical themes in his work was Juan Cordero in the mid 19th century.<br/>4. Although he did mostly work with religious themes such as the cupola of the Santa Teresa Church and other churches, he painted a secular mural at the request of Gabino Barreda at the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria (since disappeared).The latter 19th century was dominated politically by the Porfirio Díaz regime.<br/>5. This government was the first to push for the cultural development of the country, supporting the Academy of San Carlos and sending promising artists abroad to study.<br/>6. However, this effort left out indigenous culture and people, with aim of making Mexico like Europe.<br/>7. Gerardo Murillo, also known as Dr. Atl, is considered to be the first modern Mexican muralists with the idea that Mexican art should reflect Mexican life.<br/>8. Academy training and the government had only promoted imitations of European art.<br/>9. Atl and other early muralists pressured the Diaz government to allow them to paint on building walls to escape this formalism.<br/>10. Atl also organized an independent exhibition of native Mexican artists promoting many indigenous and national themes along with color schemes that would later appear in mural painting.<br/>11. The first modern Mexican mural, painted by Atl, was a series of female nudes using “Atlcolor” a substance Atl invented himself, very shortly before the beginning of the Mexican Revolution .<br/>12. Another influence on the young artists of the late Porfirian period was the graphic work of José Guadalupe Posada, who mocked European styles and created cartoons with social and political criticism.The Mexican Revolution itself was the culmination of political and social opposition to Porfirio Díaz policies.<br/>13. One important oppositional group was a small intellectual community that included Antonio Curo, Alfonso Reyes and José Vasconcelos.<br/>14. They promoted a populist philosophy that coincided with the social and political criticism of Atl and Posada and influenced the next generation of painters such as Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros.These ideas gained power as a result of the Mexican Revolution, which overthrew the Díaz regime in less than a year.<br/>15. However, there was nearly a decade of fighting among the various factions vying for power.<br/>16. Governments changed frequently with a number of assassination, including that of Francisco I. Madero who initiated the struggle.<br/>17. It ended in the early 1920s with one-party rule in the hands of the Álvaro Obregón faction, which became the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI).<br/>18. <strike>During the Revolution, Atl supported the Carranza faction and promoted the work of Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros, who would later be the founders of the muralism movement.</strike><br/>19. Through the war and until 1921, Atl continued to paint murals among other activities including teaching the Mexico’s next generation of artists and muralists.<br/>"
Mexican_muralism-Artistry,"13, 14","Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Mexican muralism<br/>Section: Artistry<br/><br/>1. Mexican populist art production from the 1920s to the 1950s is often grouped under the name of “Escuela Mexicana de Pintura (y Escultura) (Mexican School of Painting and Sculpture), coined in the 1930s by art historians and critics.<br/>2. The term is not well-defined as it does not distinguish among some important stylistic and thematic difference, there is no firm agreement which artists belong to it nor if muralism should be considered part of it or separate.<br/>3. It is not a school in the classic sense of the word as it includes work by more than one generation and with different styles that sometimes clash.<br/>4. However, it does involve a number of important characteristics.<br/>5. Mexican School mural painting was a combination of public ideals and artistic aesthics “positioned as a constituent of the official public sphere.” Three formal components of official Mexican muralism are defined as:1) Direct participation in official publicity and discourse2) Reciprocal integration of the visual discourse of the mural to an array of communicative practices participant in defining official publicity (including a variety of scriptural genres, but also public speech, debate and provocative public “event”)3) The development and public thematizing of a social-realist aesthetic (albeit multiform in character) as the visual register for the public sense of the mural work and as the doxic, or unquestioned, limits for public dispute over the representational space of the mural imageMost painters in this school worked in Mexico City or other cities in Mexico, working almost uninterrupted on projects and/or as teachers, generally with support of the government.<br/>6. Most were concerned with the history and identity of Mexico and politically active.<br/>7. Most art from this school was not created for direct sale but rather for diffusion in both Mexico and abroad.<br/>8. Most were formally trained, often studying in Europe and/or in the Academy of San Carlos.<br/>9. A large quantity of murals were produced in most of the country from the 1920s to 1970, generally with themes related to politics and nationalism focused often on the Mexican Revolution, mestizo identity and Mesoamerican cultural history.<br/>10. These served as a form of cohesion among members of the movement.<br/>11. The political and nationalistic aspects had little directly to do with the Mexican Revolution, especially in the later decades.<br/>12. The goal was more to glorify it and its results as a means to legitimatize the post Revolution government.<br/>13. <strike>The other political orientation was that of Marxism, especially class struggle.</strike><br/>14. <strike>This was strongest in the early movement with Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros all avowed communists.</strike><br/>15. The political messages became less radical but they remained firmly to the left.<br/>16. Much of the mural production glorified the indigenous aspect of Mexican culture, considering it an important factor in the creation of modern Mexico.<br/>17. This was added with the idea of reexamining the country’s history from a different perspective.<br/>18. One other aspect that most of the muralists shared was a rejection of the idea that art was only for the elite, but rather as a benefit for the masses.The murals took on monumental status because of where they were situated, mostly on the walls of colonial era government buildings and the themes that were painted.<br/>19. The mural painters of Mexico freely shared ideas and techniques as they were a closely knit group.<br/>20. However, the work of each was distinctive as the government did not set style and artists can generally be deduced without looking at signatures.<br/>21. Techniques included the revival of old techniques such as the fresco, painting on freshly plastered walls and encaustic or hot wax painting .<br/>22. Others used mosaics and high fire ceramics, as well as metal parts, and layers of cement.<br/>23. The most innovative of the artists was Siqueiros who worked with pyroxlene, a commercial enamel and Duco (used to paint cars), resins, asbestos, old machinery and was one of the first to use airbrush for artistic purposes.<br/>24. He pored, sprayed, dripped and splattered paint for the effects they created haphazardly.<br/>"

In addition to his two army groups, von Rundstedt also commanded the headquarters of ""Panzer Group West"" under General Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg (usually referred to as ""von Geyr"").<br/>3. This formation was nominally an administrative HQ for von Rundstedt's armoured and mobile formations, but it was later to be renamed Fifth Panzer Army and brought into the line in Normandy.<br/>4. Von Geyr and Rommel disagreed over the deployment and use of the vital Panzer divisions.Rommel recognised that the Allies would possess air superiority and would be able to harass his movements from the air.<br/>5. He therefore proposed that the armoured formations be deployed close to the invasion beaches.<br/>6. In his words, it was better to have one Panzer division facing the invaders on the first day, than three Panzer divisions three days later when the Allies would already have established a firm beachhead.<br/>7. Von Geyr argued for the standard doctrine that the Panzer formations should be concentrated in a central position around Paris and Rouen, and deployed ""en masse"" against the main Allied beachhead when this had been identified.The argument was eventually brought before Hitler for arbitration.<br/>8. He characteristically imposed an unworkable compromise solution.<br/>9. Only three Panzer divisions were given to Rommel, too few to cover all the threatened sectors.<br/>10. The remainder, nominally under Von Geyr's control, were actually designated as being in ""OKW Reserve"".<br/>11. Only three of these were deployed close enough to intervene immediately against any invasion of Northern France; the other four were dispersed in southern France and the Netherlands.<br/>12. Hitler reserved to himself the authority to move the divisions in OKW Reserve, or commit them to action.<br/>13. <strike>On 6 June many Panzer division commanders were unable to move because Hitler had not given the necessary authorisation, and his staff refused to wake him upon news of the invasion.</strike><br/>"
Invasion_of_Normandy-Assessment_of_the_battle,1,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Invasion of Normandy<br/>Section: Assessment of the battle<br/><br/>1. <strike>The Normandy landings were the first successful opposed landings across the English Channel in over eight centuries.</strike><br/>2. They were costly in terms of men, but the defeat inflicted on the Germans was one of the largest of the war.<br/>3. Strategically, the campaign led to the loss of the German position in most of France and the secure establishment of a new major front.<br/>4. In larger context the Normandy landings helped the Soviets on the Eastern front, who were facing the bulk of the German forces and, to a certain extent, contributed to the shortening of the conflict there.Although there was a shortage of artillery ammunition, at no time were the Allies critically short of any necessity.<br/>5. This was a remarkable achievement considering they did not hold a port until Cherbourg fell.<br/>6. By the time of the breakout the Allies also enjoyed a considerable superiority in numbers of troops (approximately 7:2) and armoured vehicles (approximately 4:1) which helped overcome the natural advantages the terrain gave to the German defenders.Allied intelligence and counterintelligence efforts were successful beyond expectations.<br/>7. The Operation Fortitude deception before the invasion kept German attention focused on the Pas de Calais, and indeed high-quality German forces were kept in this area, away from Normandy, until July.<br/>8. Prior to the invasion, few German reconnaissance flights took place over Britain, and those that did saw only the dummy staging areas.<br/>9. Ultra decrypts of German communications had been helpful as well, exposing German dispositions and revealing their plans such as the Mortain counterattack.Allied air operations also contributed significantly to the invasion, via close tactical support, interdiction of German lines of communication (preventing timely movement of supplies and reinforcements—particularly the critical Panzer units), and rendering the Luftwaffe ineffective in Normandy.<br/>10. Although the impact upon armoured vehicles was less than expected, air activity intimidated these units and cut their supplies.Despite initial heavy losses in the assault phase, Allied morale remained high.<br/>11. Casualty rates among all the armies were tremendous, and the Commonwealth forces had to use a recently created category—Double Intense—to be able to describe them.<br/>"

Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki-Surrender_of_Japan_and_subsequent_occupation,4,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki<br/>Section: Surrender of Japan and subsequent occupation<br/><br/>1. Until August 9, Japan's war council still insisted on its four conditions for surrender.<br/>2. On that day Hirohito ordered Kōichi Kido to ""quickly control the situation ... because the Soviet Union has declared war against us.""<br/>3. He then held an Imperial conference during which he authorized minister Shigenori Tōgō to notify the Allies that Japan would accept their terms on one condition, that the declaration ""does not comprise any demand which prejudices the prerogatives of His Majesty as a Sovereign ruler.<br/>4. <strike>""On August 12, the Emperor informed the imperial family of his decision to surrender.</strike><br/>5. One of his uncles, Prince Asaka, then asked whether the war would be continued if the ""kokutai"" could not be preserved.<br/>6. Hirohito simply replied ""Of course.""<br/>7. As the Allied terms seemed to leave intact the principle of the preservation of the Throne, Hirohito recorded on August 14 his capitulation announcement which was broadcast to the Japanese nation the next day despite a short rebellion by militarists opposed to the surrender.In his declaration, Hirohito referred to the atomic bombings:In his ""Rescript to the Soldiers and Sailors"" delivered on August 17, he stressed the impact of the Soviet invasion and his decision to surrender, omitting any mention of the bombs.<br/>8. Hirohito met with General MacArthur on September 27, saying to him that ""he peace party did not prevail until the bombing of Hiroshima created a situation which could be dramatized.""<br/>9. Furthermore, the ""Rescript to the Soldiers and Sailors"" speech he told MacArthur about was just personal, not political, and never stated that the Soviet intervention in Manchuria was the main reason for surrender.<br/>10. In fact, a day after the bombing of Nagasaki and the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, Hirohito ordered his advisers, primarily Chief Cabinet Secretary Hisatsune Sakomizu, Kawada Mizuho, and Masahiro Yasuoka, to write up a surrender speech.<br/>11. In Hirohito's speech, days before announcing it on radio on August 15, he gave three major reasons for surrender: Tokyo's defenses would not be complete before the American invasion of Japan, Ise Shrine would be lost to the Americans, and atomic weapons deployed by the Americans would lead to the death of the entire Japanese race.<br/>12. Despite the Soviet intervention, Hirohito did not mention the Soviets as the main factor for surrender.<br/>"

It was not until 21 minutes after the shots that CBS's coverage of the shooting would begin.<br/>3. The reporters who had been present to report on Kennedy's win in the primary ended up crowding into the kitchen where he had been shot and the immediate aftermath was captured only by audio recording and cameras that had no live transmission capability.<br/>4. ABC was able to show scant live footage from the kitchen after Kennedy had been transported but unlike CBS and NBC, all of ABC's coverage from the Ambassador was in black and white.<br/>5. CBS and NBC shot footage in the kitchen of the shooting's aftermath on color film, which could not be broadcast until it was developed two hours after the incident.Reporter Andrew West of KRKD, a Mutual Broadcasting System radio affiliate in Los Angeles, captured on audio tape the sounds of the immediate aftermath of the shooting but not the actual shooting itself.<br/>6.

Assassination_of_Robert_F._Kennedy-Second_gunman_theory,8,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy<br/>Section: Second gunman theory<br/><br/>1. The location of Kennedy's wounds suggested that his assailant had stood behind him, but some witnesses said that Sirhan faced west as Kennedy moved through the pantry facing east.<br/>2. This has led to the suggestion that a second gunman actually fired the fatal shot, a possibility supported by coroner Thomas Noguchi who stated that the fatal shot was behind Kennedy's right ear and had been fired at a distance of approximately one inch.<br/>3. Other witnesses, though, said that as Sirhan approached, Kennedy was turning to his left shaking hands, facing north and so exposing his right side.<br/>4. As recently as 2008, eyewitness John Pilger asserted his belief that there must have been a second gunman.<br/>5. During a re-examination of the case in 1975, the Los Angeles Superior Court ordered expert examination of the possibility of a second gun having been used, and the conclusion of the experts was that there was little or no evidence to support this theory.In 2007, analysis of an audio tape recording of the shooting made by freelance reporter Stanislaw Pruszynski appeared to indicate, according to forensic expert Philip Van Praag, that thirteen shots were fired, even though Sirhan's gun held only eight rounds.<br/>6. Van Praag states that the recording also reveals at least two cases where the timing between shots was shorter than physically possible.<br/>7. The presence of more than eight shots on the tape was corroborated by forensic audio specialists Wes Dooley and Paul Pegas of Audio Engineering Associates in Pasadena, California, forensic audio and ballistics expert Eddy B. Brixen in Copenhagen, Denmark, and audio specialist Phil Spencer Whitehead of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia.<br/>8. <strike>Some other acoustic experts, however, have stated that no more than eight shots were recorded on the audio tape.On February 22, 2012, Sirhan's lawyers, William Pepper and Laurie Dusek, filed a court brief in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles claiming that a second gunman fired the shots that killed Kennedy.</strike><br/>9.

Cortelyou, feared an assassination attempt would take place during a visit to the Temple of Music, and twice took it off the schedule.<br/>6. McKinley restored it each time.Czolgosz had lost his job during the economic Panic of 1893 and turned to anarchism, a political philosophy whose adherents had recently killed foreign leaders.<br/>7. Regarding McKinley as a symbol of oppression, Czolgosz felt it was his duty as an anarchist to kill him.<br/>8. Unable to get near McKinley during the earlier part of the presidential visit, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice as the President reached to shake his hand in the reception line at the temple.<br/>9. One bullet grazed McKinley; the other entered his abdomen and was never found.McKinley initially appeared to be recovering, but took a turn for the worse on September 13 as his wounds became gangrenous, and died early the next morning; Vice President Theodore Roosevelt succeeded him.<br/>10.

In September 1901, William McKinley was at the height of his power as president.<br/>2. Elected in 1896, during the serious economic depression resulting from the Panic of 1893, he had defeated his Democratic rival, William Jennings Bryan.<br/>3. McKinley led the nation both to a return to prosperity and to victory in the Spanish-American War in 1898, taking possession of such Spanish colonies as Puerto Rico and the Philippines.<br/>4. Re-elected handily in a rematch against Bryan in 1900, according to historical writer Eric Rauchway, ""it looked as if the McKinley Administration would continue peaceably unbroken for another four years, a government devoted to prosperity"".McKinley's original vice president, Garret Hobart, had died in 1899, and McKinley left the choice of a running mate to the 1900 Republican National Convention.<br/>5. In advance of the convention, New York's Republican political boss, Senator Thomas C. Platt, saw an opportunity to politically sideline his state's governor, former Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt, by pushing for his nomination as vice president.<br/>6. Roosevelt accepted the nomination and was elected on McKinley's ticket.Leon Czolgosz was born in Detroit, Michigan, in 1873, the son of Polish immigrants.<br/>7. The Czolgosz family moved a number of times as Paul Czolgosz, Leon's father, sought work throughout the Midwest.<br/>8. <strike>As an adult, Leon Czolgosz worked in a Cleveland factory until he lost his job in a labor dispute in 1893.</strike><br/>9. Thereafter, he worked irregularly and attended political and religious meetings, trying to understand the reasons for the economic turmoil of the Panic of 1893.<br/>10. In so doing, he became interested in anarchism.<br/>11. By 1901, this movement was feared in the United States—New York's highest court had ruled that the act of identifying oneself as an anarchist in front of an audience was a breach of the peace.<br/>12. Anarchists had taken a toll in Europe of a half-dozen officials and members of royal houses, and had been blamed for the 1886 Haymarket bombing in Chicago.Two American presidents had been assassinated in the 19th century—Abraham Lincoln in 1865 and James Garfield in 1881.<br/>13. John Wilkes Booth, Lincoln's assassin, had been embittered by the Confederate defeat in the American Civil War; Charles Guiteau, the assassin of Garfield, was an eccentric (possibly insane) man motivated by personal political and religious views who had unsuccessfully sought office in Garfield's administration.<br/>14. Although two presidents had been struck down by assassins, McKinley did not like security personnel to come between him and the people.<br/>15. When in his hometown, Canton, Ohio, he often walked to church or the business district without protection, and in Washington went on drives with his wife without any guard in the carriage.<br/>"

Specifically he suggested that future Communist Party elections should offer a choice between multiple candidates, elected by secret ballot, however the CPSU delegates at the Plenum watered down Gorbachev's words and democratic choice within the Communist Party was never significantly implemented.<br/>3. In addition Gorbachev radically expanded the scope of Glasnost stating that no subject was off limits for open discussion within the media, although the cautious intelligensia took almost a year to begin pushing the boundaries to see if he meant what he said.<br/>4. For the first time, the Communist Party leader, speaking at the Plenum of the Central Committee, appealed over the heads of its members for the people's support in exchange for a dramatic expansion of liberties.<br/>5. The tactic proved successful in that within two years political reform was invulnerable to the party 'conservatives', the unintended consequence was that having saved reform, the January 1987 choice, ultimately killed the very system it was designed to save.On 7 February 1987 dozens of political prisoners were freed in the first group release since the Khrushchev years in the 1950s.<br/>6. On May 6, 1987 Pamyat, a Russian Nationalist group, held an unsanctioned demonstration in Moscow.<br/>7. The authorities not only did not break up the demonstration by force—but later, the police kept traffic out of the demonstrators' way while they marched to an impromptu meeting with Boris Yeltsin, head of the Moscow Communist Party, and at that time one of Mikhail Gorbachev's closest allies in the ruling Politburo.On July 25, 1987 a group of 300 Crimean Tatars, calling for the right to return to the Crimean homeland from which they were deported in 1944, staged a noisy demonstration for several hours near the Kremlin Wall as dozens of police and soldiers looked on.On 10 September 1987, after a lecture from hard-liner Yegor Ligachev at the Politburo for allowing two small unsanctioned demonstrations on Moscow streets, Boris Yeltsin wrote a letter of resignation to Gorbachev who was holidaying on the Black Sea.<br/>8. When Gorbachev received the letter he was stunned – nobody in Soviet history had voluntarily resigned from the ranks of the Politburo.<br/>9. At the October 27, 1987 plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the CPSU, Yeltsin, frustrated that Gorbachev had not addressed any of the issues outlined in his resignation letter asked to speak.<br/>10. He expressed his discontent with both the slow pace of reform in society, the servility shown to the General Secretary, and opposition to him from Ligachev making his position untenable, before requesting to resign from the Politburo.<br/>11. This was sensational.<br/>12. Besides the fact that nobody had ever quit the Politburo, no one in the party had ever had the audacity to address a leader of the party in such a manner in front of the Central Committee since Leon Trotsky in the 1920s.<br/>13. In his reply, Gorbachev accused Yeltsin of ""political immaturity"" and ""absolute irresponsibility"".<br/>14. Nobody in the Central Committee backed Yeltsin.Within days news of Yeltsin's actions leaked and rumours of his 'secret speech' at the Central Committee spread throughout Moscow.<br/>15. Soon fabricated ""samizdat"" versions began to circulate.<br/>16. This was the beginning of Yeltsin's re-branding as a rebel and he continued to grow in popularity as an anti-establishment figure.<br/>17.

Dissolution_of_the_Monasteries-Ireland,6,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Dissolution of the Monasteries<br/>Section: Ireland<br/><br/>1. The dissolutions in Ireland followed a very different course from those in England and Wales.<br/>2. There were around 400 religious houses in Ireland in 1530—many more, relative to population and material wealth than in England and Wales.<br/>3. In marked distinction to the situation in England, in Ireland the houses of friars had flourished in the 15th century, attracting popular support and financial endowments, undertaking many ambitious building schemes, and maintaining a regular conventual and spiritual life.<br/>4. They constituted around half of the total number of religious houses.<br/>5. Irish monasteries, by contrast, had experienced a catastrophic decline in numbers, such that by the 16th century only a minority maintained the daily observance of the Divine Office.<br/>6. <strike>Henry's direct authority, as Lord of Ireland and from 1541 as King of Ireland, only extended to the area of the Pale immediately around Dublin.</strike><br/>7. Outside this area, he could only proceed by tactical agreement with clan chiefs and local lords.Nevertheless, Henry was determined to carry through a policy of dissolution in Ireland—and in 1537 introduced legislation into the Irish Parliament to legalise the closure of monasteries.<br/>8. The process faced considerable opposition, and only sixteen houses were suppressed.<br/>9. Henry remained resolute however, and from 1541 as part of the Tudor conquest of Ireland he continued to press for the area of successful dissolution to be extended.<br/>10. For the most part, this involved making deals with local lords, under which monastic property was granted away in exchange for allegiance to the new Irish Crown; and consequently Henry acquired little if any of the wealth of the Irish houses.<br/>11. By the time of Henry's death (1547) around half of the Irish houses had been suppressed; but many continued to resist dissolution until well into the reign of Elizabeth I, and some houses in the West of Ireland remained active until the early 17th century.<br/>12. In 1649, Oliver Cromwell led a Parliamentary army seeking to subjugate Ireland, and systematically sought out and destroyed former monastic houses.<br/>13. Subsequently, however, sympathetic landowners housed monks or friars close to several ruined religious houses, allowing them a continued covert existence during the 17th and 18th centuries, subject to the dangers of discovery and legal ejection or imprisonment.<br/>"

Examples of these accidental and contingent factors that precipitated the Revolution include World War I's timing, chance, and the poor leadership of Tsar Nicholas II as well as liberal and moderate socialists.<br/>5. According to this historical interpretation, it was not popular support, but rather Bolshevik manipulation of the masses and the organization’s ruthlessness and superior structure which enabled it to survive.<br/>6. For these historians, the Bolsheviks’ defeat in the Constituent Assembly elections of November–December 1917 demonstrated popular opposition to the Bolsheviks’ coup, as did the scale and breadth of the Civil War.These historians saw the organization of the Bolshevik party as proto-totalitarian.<br/>7. Their interpretation of the October Revolution as a violent coup organized by a proto-totalitarian party reinforced the idea that totalitarianism is an inherent part of Soviet history.<br/>8.

Though both Western and Russian historians now have access to many of these archives, the impact of the dissolution of the USSR can be seen most clearly in the work of historians in the former USSR.<br/>4. While the disintegration essentially helped solidify the Western and Revisionist views, post-USSR Russian historians largely repudiated the former Soviet historical interpretation of the Revolution.<br/>5. In other words, the established Soviet view of the October Revolution has been challenged, and consequently “Russian historians’ outlook has come closer to that of their Western conferes.” As Stephen Kotkin argues, 1991 prompted “a return to political history and the apparent resurrection of totalitarianism, the interpretive view that, in different ways…revisionists sought to bury”.<br/>6. In other words, after 1991, there has been the revival among some historians of the “continuity thesis”, the idea that there was an uncomplicated, natural evolution from the October Revolution’s organizational structure to Stalin’s Gulags.<br/>"
Invasion_of_Poland-Abstract,7,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Invasion of Poland<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. The Invasion of Poland, also known as the September Campaign or 1939 Defensive War or the Fourth Partition of Poland (Polish: ""Kampania wrześniowa"" or ""Wojna obronna 1939 roku"" or ""IV rozbiór Polski"") in Poland and the Poland Campaign (German: ""Polenfeldzug"") or Fall Weiß (Case White) in Germany, was an invasion of Poland by Germany, the Soviet Union, and a small Slovak contingent that marked the beginning of World War II in Europe.<br/>2. The German invasion began on 1 September 1939, one week after the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, while the Soviet invasion commenced on 17 September 1939 following the Molotov-Tōgō agreement which terminated the Russian and Japanese hostilities (Nomonhan incident) in the east on 16 September 1939.<br/>3. The campaign ended on 6 October 1939 with Germany and the Soviet Union dividing and annexing the whole of Poland.The morning after the Gleiwitz incident, German forces invaded Poland from the north, south, and west.<br/>4. As the Germans advanced, Polish forces withdrew from their forward bases of operation close to the Polish–German border to more established lines of defence to the east.<br/>5. After the mid-September Polish defeat in the Battle of the Bzura, the Germans gained an undisputed advantage.<br/>6. Polish forces then withdrew to the southeast where they prepared for a long defence of the Romanian Bridgehead and awaited expected support and relief from France and the United Kingdom.<br/>7. <strike>The two countries had pacts with Poland and had declared war on Germany on 3 September, though in the end their aid to Poland in the September campaign was very limited.The Soviet Red Army's invasion of Eastern Poland on 17 September, in accordance with a secret protocol of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, rendered the Polish plan of defence obsolete.</strike><br/>8. Facing a second front, the Polish government concluded the defence of the Romanian Bridgehead was no longer feasible and ordered an emergency evacuation of all troops to neutral Romania.<br/>9. On 6 October, following the Polish defeat at the Battle of Kock, German and Soviet forces gained full control over Poland.<br/>10. The success of the invasion marked the end of the Second Polish Republic, though Poland never formally surrendered.On 8 October, after an initial period of military administration, Germany directly annexed western Poland and the former Free City of Danzig and placed the remaining block of territory under the administration of the newly established General Government.<br/>11. The Soviet Union incorporated its newly acquired areas into its constituent Belarusian and Ukrainian republics, and immediately started a campaign of sovietization.<br/>12. In the aftermath of the invasion, a collective of underground resistance organizations formed the Polish Underground State within the territory of the former Polish state.<br/>13. Many of the military exiles that managed to escape Poland subsequently joined the Polish Armed Forces in the West, an armed force loyal to the Polish government in exile.<br/>"
Invasion_of_Poland-German_plan,16,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Invasion of Poland<br/>Section: German plan<br/><br/>1. Details of the campaign.German plan.The September Campaign was devised by General Franz Halder, chief of the general staff, and directed by General Walther von Brauchitsch, the commander in chief of the upcoming campaign.<br/>2. It called for the start of hostilities before a declaration of war, and pursued a doctrine of mass encirclement and destruction of enemy forces.<br/>3. The infantry—far from completely mechanized but fitted with fast moving artillery and logistic support—was to be supported by ""Panzers"" and small numbers of truck-mounted infantry (the ""Schützen"" regiments, forerunners of the ""panzergrenadiers"") to assist the rapid movement of troops and concentrate on localized parts of the enemy front, eventually isolating segments of the enemy, surrounding, and destroying them.<br/>4. The pre-war ""armored idea"" (which an American journalist in 1939 dubbed ""Blitzkrieg"")—which was advocated by some generals, including Heinz Guderian—would have had the armor punching holes in the enemy's front and ranging deep into rear areas; in actuality, the campaign in Poland would be fought along more traditional lines.<br/>5. This stemmed from conservatism on the part of the German high command, who mainly restricted the role of armor and mechanized forces to supporting the conventional infantry divisions.Poland's terrain was well suited for mobile operations when the weather cooperated; the country had flat plains with long frontiers totalling almost , Poland's long border with Germany on the west and north—facing East Prussia—extended .<br/>6. Those had been lengthened by another on the southern side in the aftermath of the Munich Agreement of 1938.<br/>7. The German incorporation of Bohemia and Moravia and creation of the German puppet state of Slovakia meant that Poland's southern flank was exposed.Hitler demanded that Poland be conquered in six weeks, but German planners thought that it would require three months.<br/>8. They intended to fully exploit their long border with the great enveloping manoeuver of ""Fall Weiss"".<br/>9. German units were to invade Poland from three directions:<br/>10. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A main attack over the western Polish border.<br/>11. This was to be carried out by Army Group South commanded by General Gerd von Rundstedt, attacking from German Silesia and from the Moravian and Slovak border: General Johannes Blaskowitz's 8th Army was to drive eastward against Łódź; General Wilhelm List's 14th Army was to push on toward Kraków and to turn the Poles' Carpathian flank; and General Walter von Reichenau's 10th Army, in the centre with Army Group South's armor, was to deliver the decisive blow with a northeastward thrust into the heart of Poland.<br/>12. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second route of attack from northern Prussia.<br/>13. General Fedor von Bock commanded Army Group North, comprising General Georg von Küchler's 3rd Army, which was to strike southward from East Prussia, and General Günther von Kluge's 4th Army, which was to attack eastward across the base of the Polish Corridor.<br/>14. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tertiary attack by part of Army Group South's allied Slovak units from Slovakia.<br/>15. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From within Poland, the German minority would assist by engaging in diversion and sabotage operations through ""Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz"" units prepared before the war.<br/><br/>16. <strike>All three assaults were to converge on Warsaw, while the main Polish army was to be encircled and destroyed west of the Vistula.</strike></br>17. ""Fall Weiss"" was initiated on 1 September 1939, and was the first operation of Second World War in Europe.<br/>"
Operation_Barbarossa-Events,19,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Operation Barbarossa<br/>Section: Events<br/><br/>1. Looking back near the end of the war, as Germany's inevitable and impending defeat loomed ever closer, Hitler attributed great blame to Mussolini's Greek fiasco as the cause of his own subsequent catastrophe.<br/>2. Shirer argues that the fatal decision of the operation was the postponement from the original date of 15 May because Hitler wanted to intervene against an anti-German coup in Yugoslavia and Greek advances against Italy's occupation of Albania.<br/>3. As an explanation of Germany's calamitous defeat in the Soviet Union, this had little to commend it.<br/>4. But, although the diversion of German resources into Greece just prior to the attack on the Soviet Union scarcely helped the latter enterprise, Mussolini's foolishness did not undermine 'Barbarossa' before the operation started.<br/>5. During the campaign, Hitler ordered the main thrust toward Moscow to be diverted southward to help the Southern Army Group capture Ukraine.<br/>6. This move delayed the assault on the Soviet capital, though it also helped secure Army Group Center's southern flank.<br/>7. By the time they turned to Moscow, the Red Army's fierce resistance, the mud following the autumn rains and, eventually, snow, brought their advance to a halt.In addition, resistance by the Soviets, who proclaimed a ""Great Patriotic War"" in defense of the motherland, was much more fierce than the German command had expected.<br/>8. The border fortress of Brest, Belarus illustrates that tenacity: attacked on the very first day of the German invasion, the fortress was expected to fall within hours, but held out over a week.<br/>9. (Soviet propaganda later asserted it held out for six weeks).<br/>10. German logistics also became a major problem, as supply lines grew very long and vulnerable to partisan attacks in the rear.<br/>11. The Soviets also carried out a scorched earth policy on some of the land they were forced to abandon in order to deny the Germans food, fuel and buildings.Despite the setbacks, the German advance continued, often destroying or surrounding whole armies of Soviet troops and forcing them to surrender.<br/>12. The battle for Kiev was especially brutal.<br/>13. On 19 September, Army Group South seized control of Kiev, and took 665,000 prisoners.<br/>14. Kiev was later awarded the title Hero City for its defense.Army Group North, which was to conquer the Baltic countries and eventually Leningrad, reached the southern outskirts of Leningrad by August 1941.<br/>15. There, fierce Soviet resistance stopped it.<br/>16. Since capturing the city seemed too costly, German command decided to starve the city to death by blockade, starting the Siege of Leningrad.<br/>17. The city held out, despite several attempts by the Germans to break through its defenses, unrelenting air and artillery attacks, and severe shortages of food and fuel, until the Germans were driven back from the city's approaches in early 1944.<br/>18. The siege resulted in the deaths of some one million of the city's inhabitants.<br/>19. <strike>Leningrad was the first Soviet city to receive the title of 'Hero City'.In addition to the main attacks of ""Barbarossa"", German forces occupied the Finnish district of Petsamo in order to secure its important nickel mines.</strike><br/>20. They also launched a series of attacks against Murmansk beginning on 28 June 1941, known as Operation Silberfuchs.<br/>"

With the failure of the Battle of Moscow, all German plans of a quick defeat of the Soviet Union had to be revised.<br/>2. The Soviet counteroffensives in the winter of 1941 caused heavy casualties on both sides, but ultimately eliminated the German threat to Moscow.<br/>3. Nevertheless, despite this setback, the Soviet Union had suffered heavily from the loss of large parts of its army, allowing the Germans to mount another large-scale offensive in the summer of 1942, called Case Blue, now directed towards the oil fields of Baku.<br/>4. This offensive failed just as ""Barbarossa"" had: the Germans again conquered vast amounts of no-mans-land, but they had again failed to achieve their ultimate goals when they were defeated at Stalingrad.<br/>5. By then, the Soviet war economy was fully operational, so the Soviet Union was able to simply outproduce the Germans, who were not prepared for a long war of attrition.<br/>6. As a result, the Germans' last all-out offensive in 1943 at the battle of Kursk failed.<br/>7. After three years of constant warfare, the Germans were exhausted; thus the Soviets were finally able to defeat the Germans decisively in Operation ""Bagration"" during the summer of 1944.<br/>8. <strike>This led to a chain of Soviet victories which pushed the Germans back to Berlin in just one year, leading to the surrender of Germany on 8 May 1945.</strike><br/>"

Democrats supported the joint resolution 58% and 39% in the Senate and House respectively.<br/>3. The resolution asserts the authorization by the Constitution of the United States and the Congress for the President to fight anti-United States terrorism.<br/>4. Citing the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998, the resolution reiterated that it should be the policy of the United States to remove the Saddam Hussein regime and promote a democratic replacement.The resolution ""supported"" and ""encouraged"" diplomatic efforts by President George W. Bush to ""strictly enforce through the U.N. Security Council all relevant Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq"" and ""obtain prompt and decisive action by the Security Council to ensure that Iraq abandons its strategy of delay, evasion, and noncompliance and promptly and strictly complies with all relevant Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq.""<br/>5. The resolution authorized President Bush to use the Armed Forces of the United States ""as he determines to be necessary and appropriate"" to ""defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions regarding Iraq.<br/>6. ""The legality of the invasion of Iraq has been challenged since its inception on a number of fronts, and several prominent supporters of the invasion in all the invading nations have publicly and privately cast doubt on its legality.<br/>7. It is argued that the invasion was fully legal because authorization was implied by the United Nations Security Council.<br/>8. International legal experts, including the International Commission of Jurists, a group of 31 leading Canadian law professors, and the U.S.-based Lawyers Committee on Nuclear Policy, have denounced both of these rationales.On Thursday 20 November 2003, an article published in the Guardian alleged that Richard Perle, a senior member of the administration's Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee, conceded that the invasion was illegal but still justified.The United Nations Security Council has passed nearly 60 resolutions on Iraq and Kuwait since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.<br/>9. The most relevant to this issue is Resolution 678, passed on 29 November 1990.<br/>10. It authorizes ""member states co-operating with the Government of Kuwait... to use all necessary means"" to (1) implement Security Council Resolution 660 and other resolutions calling for the end of Iraq's occupation of Kuwait and withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwaiti territory and (2) ""restore international peace and security in the area.""<br/>11. Resolution 678 has not been rescinded or nullified by succeeding resolutions and Iraq was not alleged after 1991 to invade Kuwait or to threaten do so.Resolution 1441 was most prominent during the run up to the war and formed the main backdrop for Secretary of State Colin Powell's address to the Security Council one month before the invasion.<br/>12. According to an independent commission of inquiry set up by the government of the Netherlands, UN resolution 1441 ""cannot reasonably be interpreted (as the Dutch government did) as authorising individual member states to use military force to compel Iraq to comply with the Security Council's resolutions.""<br/>13. Accordingly, the Dutch commission concluded that the 2003 invasion violated international law.At the same time, Bush Administration officials advanced a parallel legal argument using the earlier resolutions, which authorized force in response to Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.<br/>14. <strike>Under this reasoning, by failing to disarm and submit to weapons inspections, Iraq was in violation of U.N. Security Council Resolutions 660 and 678, and the U.S. could legally compel Iraq's compliance through military means.Critics and proponents of the legal rationale based on the U.N. resolutions argue that the legal right to determine how to enforce its resolutions lies with the Security Council alone, not with individual nations.In February 2006, Luis Moreno Ocampo, the lead prosecutor for the International Criminal Court, reported that he had received 240 separate communications regarding the legality of the war, many of which concerned British participation in the invasion.</strike><br/>15. In a letter addressed to the complainants, Mr. Moreno Ocampo explained that he could only consider issues related to conduct during the war and not to its underlying legality as a possible crime of aggression because no provision had yet been adopted which ""defines the crime and sets out the conditions under which the Court may exercise jurisdiction with respect to it.""<br/>16. In a March 2007 interview with the Sunday Telegraph, Moreno Ocampo encouraged Iraq to sign up with the court so that it could bring cases related to alleged war crimes.United States Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich held a press conference on the evening of 24 April 2007, revealing US House Resolution 333 and the three articles of impeachment against Vice President Dick Cheney.<br/>17. He charged Cheney with manipulating the evidence of Iraq's weapons program, deceiving the nation about Iraq's connection to al-Qaeda, and threatening aggression against Iran in violation of the United Nations Charter.<br/>"

Criticisms about the evidence used to justify the war notwithstanding, many opponents of military intervention objected, saying that a diplomatic solution would be preferable, and that war should be reserved as a truly last resort.<br/>2. <strike>This position was exemplified by French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin, who responded to U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell's 5 February 2003 presentation to the U.N Security Council by saying that: ""Given the choice between military intervention and an inspections regime that is inadequate because of a failure to cooperate on Iraq's part, we must choose the decisive reinforcement of the means of inspections.</strike><br/>3. ""In response to Donald Rumsfeld's reference to European countries that did not support the invasion of Iraq as 'Old Europe', Dominique de Villepin ended his speech with words that would later come to embody the French-German political, economic, and military alliance throughout the beginning of the 21st Century: ""This message comes to you today from an old country, France, from a continent like mine, Europe, that has known wars, occupation and barbarity.<br/>4. (…) Faithful to its values, it wishes resolutely to act with all the members of the international community.<br/>5. It believes in our ability to build together a better world.<br/>6. ""The direct opposition between diplomatic solution and military intervention involving France and the United States which was personified by Chirac versus Bush and later Powell versus de Villepin, became a milestone in the Franco-American relations.<br/>7. Anti-French propangada exploiting the classic Francophobic clichés immediately ensued in the United States and the United Kingdom.<br/>8.

Battle_of_Britain-Fighters,4,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Battle of Britain<br/>Section: Fighters<br/><br/>1. The ""Luftwaffe""'s Messerschmitt Bf 109E and Bf 110C fought against the RAF's workhorse Hurricane Mk I and the less numerous Spitfire Mk I.<br/>2. The Bf 109E had a better climb rate and was faster than the Hurricane Mk I, depending on altitude.<br/>3. In spring and summer 1940, RAF fighters benefited from increased availability of 100 octane aviation fuel, which allowed their Merlin engines to generate significantly more power through the use of an Emergency Boost Override.<br/>4. <strike>In September 1940, the more powerful Mk IIa series 1 Hurricanes started entering service in small numbers.</strike><br/>5. This version was capable of a maximum speed of , some more than the Mk I.The performance of the Spitfire over Dunkirk came as a surprise to the ""Jagdwaffe"", although the German pilots retained a strong belief that the 109 was the superior fighter.<br/>6. The British fighters were equipped with eight Browning .303 (7.7mm) machine guns, while most Bf 109Es had two 7.92mm machine guns supplemented by two 20mm cannons.<br/>7. The latter was much more effective than the .303; many German planes landed despite large numbers of .303 hits.<br/>8. At some altitudes, the Bf 109 could outclimb the British fighter.<br/>9. It could also engage in vertical-plane negative-""g"" manœuvres without the engine cutting out because its DB 601 engine used fuel injection; this allowed the 109 to dive away from attackers more readily than the carburettor equipped Merlin.<br/>10. On the other hand, the Bf 109E had a much larger turning circle than its two foes.<br/>11. In general, though, as Alfred Price noted in ""The Spitfire Story"":The Bf 109 was also used as a ""Jabo"" (""jagdbomber"", fighter-bomber)—the E-4/B and E-7 models could carry a 250 kg bomb underneath the fuselage, the later model arriving during the Battle.<br/>12. The Bf 109, unlike the ""Stuka"", could fight on equal terms with RAF fighters after releasing its ordnance.At the start of the battle, the twin-engined Messerschmitt Bf 110C long range ""Zerstörer"" (""Destroyer"") was also expected to engage in air-to-air combat while escorting the ""Luftwaffe"" bomber fleet.<br/>13. Although the 110 was faster than the Hurricane and almost as fast as the Spitfire, its lack of manoeuvrability and acceleration meant that it was a failure as a long-range escort fighter.<br/>14. On 13 and 15 August, 13 and 30 aircraft were lost, the equivalent of an entire ""Gruppe"", and the type's worst losses during the campaign.<br/>15. This trend continued with a further eight and fifteen lost on 16 and 17 August.<br/>16. Göring ordered the Bf 110 units to operate ""where the range of the single-engined machines were not sufficient"".The most successful role of the Bf 110 during the battle was as a ""Schnellbomber"" (fast bomber).<br/>17. The Bf 110 usually used a shallow dive to bomb the target and escaped at high speed.<br/>18. One unit, ""Erprobungsgruppe 210"" – initially formed as the service test unit (""Erprobungskommando"") for the emerging successor to the 110, the Me 210 – proved that the Bf 110 could still be used to good effect in attacking small or ""pinpoint"" targets.The RAF's Boulton Paul Defiant had some initial success over Dunkirk because of its resemblance to the Hurricane; ""Luftwaffe"" fighters attacking from the rear were surprised by its unusual gun turret.<br/>19. However, during the Battle of Britain, this single-engined two-seater proved hopelessly outclassed.<br/>20. For various reasons, the Defiant lacked any form of forward-firing armament, and the heavy turret and second crewman meant it could not outrun or outmanœuvre either the Bf 109 or Bf 110.<br/>21. By the end of August, after disastrous losses, the aircraft was withdrawn from daylight service.<br/>"
Battle_of_Britain-The_Dowding_System,2,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Battle of Britain<br/>Section: The Dowding System<br/><br/>1. RAF strategy.The Dowding System.During early tests of the Chain Home system, the slow flow of information from the CH radars and observers to the aircraft often caused them to miss their ""bandits"".<br/>2. <strike>The solution, today known as the ""Dowding system"", was to create a set of reporting chains to move information from the various observation points to the pilots in their fighters.</strike><br/>3. It was named after its chief architect, ""Stuffy"" Dowding.Reports from CH radars and the Royal Observer Corps were sent directly to Fighter Command Headquarters (FCHQ) where they were ""filtered"" to combine multiple reports of the same formations into single tracks.<br/>4. Telephone operators would then forward only the information of interest to the Group headquarters, where the map would be re-created.<br/>5. This process was repeated to produce another version of the map at the Sector level, covering a much smaller area.<br/>6. Looking over their maps, Group level commanders could select squadrons to attack particular targets.<br/>7. From that point the Sector operators would give commands to the fighters to arrange an interception, as well as return them to base.<br/>8. Sector stations also controlled the anti-aircraft batteries in their area; an army officer sat beside each fighter controller and directed the gun crews when to open and cease fire.The Dowding system dramatically improved the speed and accuracy of the information that flowed to the pilots.<br/>9. During the early war period it was expected that an average interception mission might have a 30% chance of ever seeing their target.<br/>10. During the Battle, the Dowding system maintained an average rate over 75%, with several examples of 100% rates - every fighter dispatched found and intercepted its target.<br/>11. Luftwaffe fighters randomly found targets and often returned home having never seen an enemy aircraft.<br/>12. The result is what is now known as an example of ""force multiplication""; RAF fighters were as effective as two or more Luftwaffe fighters, greatly offsetting, or overturning, the disparity in actual numbers.<br/>"
Battle_of_Red_Cliffs-Analysis,5,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Battle of Red Cliffs<br/>Section: Analysis<br/><br/>1. A combination of Cao Cao's strategic errors and the effectiveness of Huang Gai's ruse had resulted in the allied victory at the Battle of Red Cliffs.<br/>2. Zhou Yu had previously observed that Cao Cao's generals and soldiers comprised mostly cavalry and infantry, and few had any experience in naval warfare.<br/>3. Cao Cao also had little support among the people of Jing Province, and thus lacked a secure forward base of operations .<br/>4. Despite the strategic acumen Cao Cao had displayed in earlier campaigns and battles, in this case he had simply assumed that numerical superiority would eventually defeat the Sun and Liu navy.<br/>5. <strike>Cao's first tactical mistake was converting his massive army of infantry and cavalry into a marine corps and navy: with only a few days of drills before the battle, Cao Cao's troops were ravaged by sea-sickness and lack of experience on water.</strike><br/>6. Tropical diseases, to which the southerners had long been immune, also plagued the soldiers of the north with the debilitating effects of sickness rampant in Cao Cao's camps.<br/>7. Although numerous, Cao Cao's men were already exhausted by the unfamiliar environment and the extended southern campaign, as Zhuge Liang observed: ""Even a powerful arrow at the end of its flight cannot penetrate a silk cloth"" (Military Documents 1979:193).The uncharacteristically poor preparation and miscalculations displayed by Cao Cao during this campaign may have been partly due to the recent death of his strategist and advisor Guo Jia.<br/>8. Cao Cao himself had commented: ""Had Guo Jia been with us, I would never have got into such trouble"" .<br/>9. Another key advisor, Jia Xu, had recommended after the surrender of Liu Cong that the overtaxed armies be given time to rest and replenish before engaging the armies of Sun Quan and Liu Bei, but Cao Cao disregarded the advice .<br/>10. Cao Cao's own thoughts regarding his failure at Red Cliffs suggest that he held his own actions and misfortunes responsible for the defeat, rather than the strategies utilised by his enemy during the battle: ""... it was only because of the sickness that I burnt my ships and retreated.<br/>11. It is out of all reason for Zhou Yu to take the credit for himself.""<br/>12. .<br/>"

By the end of 209, the post Cao Cao had established at Jiangling fell to Zhou Yu.<br/>2. The borders of the land under Cao Cao's control contracted about , to the area around Xiangyang .<br/>3. Liu Bei, on the other hand, had gained territory by taking over the four commanderies (Wuling, Changsha, Lingling and Guiyang) south of the Yangtze River.<br/>4. Sun Quan's troops had suffered far greater casualties than Liu Bei's in the extended conflict against Cao Ren following the Battle of Red Cliffs , and the death of Zhou Yu in 210 resulted in a drastic weakening of Sun Quan's strength in Jing Province .<br/>5. <strike>Liu Bei also occupied Jing Province that Cao Cao had recently lost — a strategic and naturally fortified area on the Yangtze River that Sun Quan claimed for himself.</strike><br/>6. The control of Jing Province provided Liu Bei with virtually unlimited access to the passage into Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) and important waterways into Wu (southeastern China), as well as dominion of the southern Yangtze River.Never again would Cao Cao command so large a fleet as he had at Jiangling, nor would a similar opportunity to destroy his southern rivals present itself again .<br/>7. The Battle of Red Cliffs and the capture of Jing Province by Liu Bei confirmed the separation of southern China from the northern heartland of the Yellow River valley, and also foreshadowed a north-south axis of hostility which would resonate for centuries .<br/>"
Battle_of_Hastings-Harold_moves_south,4,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Battle of Hastings<br/>Section: Harold moves south<br/><br/>1. After defeating his brother Tostig and Harald Hardrada in the north, Harold left much of his forces in the north, including Morcar and Edwin, and marched the rest of his army south to deal with the threatened Norman invasion.<br/>2. It is unclear when Harold learned of William's landing, but it was probably while he was travelling south.<br/>3. Harold stopped in London, and was there for about a week before Hastings, so it is likely that he spent about a week on his march south, averaging about per day, for the approximately .<br/>4. <strike>Harold camped at Caldbec Hill on the night of 13 October, near what was described as a ""hoar-apple tree"".</strike><br/>5. This location was about from William's castle at Hastings.<br/>6. Some of the early contemporary French accounts mention an emissary or emissaries sent by Harold to William, which is likely.<br/>7. Nothing came of these efforts.Although Harold attempted to surprise the Normans, William's scouts reported the English arrival to the duke.<br/>8. The exact events preceding the battle are obscure, with contradictory accounts in the sources, but all agree that William led his army from his castle and advanced towards the enemy.<br/>9. Harold had taken a defensive position at the top of Senlac Hill (present-day Battle, East Sussex), about from William's castle at Hastings.<br/>"
Battle_of_Hastings-Dispositions_of_forces_and_tactics,9,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Battle of Hastings<br/>Section: Dispositions of forces and tactics<br/><br/>1. Most recent historians conclude that Harold's forces deployed in a small, dense formation around the top of Caldbec Hill, with their flanks protected by woods and a stream and marshy ground in front of them.<br/>2. Lawson points out the possibility that the English line was a bit longer and extended enough to anchor on one of the streams nearby.<br/>3. The English formed a shield wall, with the front ranks holding their shields close together or even overlapping to provide protection from attack.More is known about the Norman deployment.<br/>4. Duke William appears to have arranged his forces in three groups, or ""battles"", which roughly corresponded to their origins.<br/>5. The left units were the Bretons, along with those from Anjou, Poitou and Maine.<br/>6. This division was led by Alan the Red, a relative of the Breton count.<br/>7. The centre was held by the Normans, under the direct command of the duke and with many of his relatives and kinsmen grouped around the ducal party.<br/>8. The final division on the right consisted of the Frenchmen, along with some men from Picardy, Boulogne, and Flanders.<br/>9. <strike>The right was commanded by William fitzOsbern and Count Eustace II of Boulogne.</strike><br/>10. The front lines were archers with a line of foot soldiers armed with spears behind.<br/>11. There were probably a few crossbowmen and slingers in with the archers.<br/>12. The cavalry was held in reserve, and a small group of clergymen and servants situated at the base of Telham Hill was not expected to take part in the fighting.William's disposition of his forces implies that he planned to open the battle with archers in the front rank weakening the enemy with arrows, followed by infantry who would engage in close combat.<br/>13. The infantry would create openings in the English lines that could be exploited by a cavalry charge to break through the English forces and pursue the fleeing soldiers.<br/>"
Battle_of_Midway-Background,11,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Battle of Midway<br/>Section: Background<br/><br/>1. Japan had attained its initial strategic goals quickly, taking the Philippines, Malaya, Singapore, and the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia); the latter, with its vital oil resources, was particularly important to Japan.<br/>2. Because of this, preliminary planning for a second phase of operations commenced as early as January 1942.<br/>3. However, there were strategic disagreements between the Imperial Army and Imperial Navy, and infighting between the Navy's GHQ and Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's Combined Fleet, such that a follow-up strategy was not formed until April 1942.<br/>4. Admiral Yamamoto finally succeeded in winning the bureaucratic struggle with a thinly veiled threat to resign, after which his plan for the Central Pacific was adopted.Yamamoto's primary strategic goal was the elimination of America's carrier forces, which he perceived as the principal threat to the overall Pacific campaign.<br/>5. This concern was acutely heightened by the Doolittle Raid on 18 April 1942, in which 16 US Army Air Forces B-25 Mitchell bombers launched from bombed targets in Tokyo and several other Japanese cities.<br/>6. The raid, while militarily insignificant, was a severe psychological shock to the Japanese and showed the existence of a gap in the defenses around the Japanese home islands as well as the accessibility of Japanese territory to American bombers.This, and other successful hit-and-run raids by American carriers in the South Pacific, showed that they were still a threat, although seemingly reluctant to be drawn into an all-out battle.<br/>7. Yamamoto reasoned that another attack on the main U.S Naval base at Pearl Harbor would induce all of the American fleet to sail out to fight, including the carriers.<br/>8. However, due to the strength of American land-based air power on the Hawaiian Islands, he judged that it was too risky to attack Pearl Harbor directly.Instead, Yamamoto selected Midway, a tiny atoll at the extreme northwest end of the Hawaiian Island chain, approximately from Oahu.<br/>9. Midway was not especially important in the larger scheme of Japan's intentions, but the Japanese felt the Americans would consider Midway a vital outpost of Pearl Harbor and would therefore be compelled to defend it vigorously.<br/>10. The U.S. did consider Midway vital; after the battle, establishment of a U.S. submarine base on Midway allowed submarines operating from Pearl Harbor to refuel and reprovision, extending their radius of operations by .<br/>11. <strike>In addition to serving as a seaplane base, Midway's airstrips also served as a forward staging point for bomber attacks on Wake Island.</strike><br/>"
Battle_of_Midway-Impact,13,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Battle of Midway<br/>Section: Impact<br/><br/>1. The Battle of Midway has often been called ""the turning point of the Pacific"".<br/>2. However, the Japanese continued to try to secure more strategic territory in the South Pacific, and the U.S. did not move from a state of naval parity to one of increasing supremacy until after several more months of hard combat.<br/>3. Thus, although Midway was the Allies' first major victory against the Japanese, it did not radically change the course of the war; instead it was the cumulative effects of the battles of the Coral Sea and Midway that reduced Japan's ability to undertake major offensives.In addition Midway paved the way for the landings on Guadalcanal, and the prolonged attrition of the Solomon Islands campaign, both of which finally allowed the Allies to take the strategic initiative and swing onto the offensive for the rest of the Pacific War.<br/>4. Finally, Midway bought the United States valuable time until the first of the new ""Essex""-class fleet carriers became available at the end of 1942.The battle also showed the worth of pre-war naval cryptanalysis and intelligence-gathering.<br/>5. These efforts continued and were expanded throughout the war in both the Pacific and Atlantic theaters.<br/>6. Successes were numerous and significant.<br/>7. For instance, Navy cryptanalysis made possible the shooting down of Admiral Yamamoto's airplane.Some authors have stated heavy losses in carriers and veteran aircrews at Midway permanently weakened the Imperial Japanese Navy.<br/>8. Parshall and Tully, however, have stated that the losses in veteran aircrew, while heavy (110, just under 25% of the aircrew embarked on the four carriers), were not crippling to the Japanese naval air-corps as a whole: the Japanese navy had some 2,000 carrier-qualified aircrew at the start of the Pacific war.A few months after Midway, the JNAF sustained similar casualty rates at both the Battle of the Eastern Solomons and Battle of Santa Cruz, and it was these battles, combined with the constant attrition of veterans during the Solomons campaign, which were the catalyst for the sharp downward spiral in operational capability.<br/>9. However, the loss of four large fleet carriers, and over 40% of the carriers' highly trained aircraft mechanics and technicians, plus the essential flight-deck crews and armorers, and the loss of organizational knowledge embodied by such highly trained crew, were heavy blows to the Japanese carrier fleet.After the battle and were the only large carriers of the original Pearl Harbor strike-force left for offensive actions.<br/>10. Of Japan's other carriers, , which was not commissioned until early 1944, would be the only fleet carrier worth teaming with ""Shōkaku"" and ""Zuikaku""; and ""Zuihō"" were light carriers, while and , although technically classified as fleet carriers, were second-rate ships of comparatively limited effectiveness.<br/>11. By the time of the Battle of the Philippine Sea, the Japanese had somewhat rebuilt their carrier forces in terms of numbers, but their planes, which by then had become obsolescent, were largely flown by inexperienced and poorly trained pilots.<br/>12. In the time it took Japan to build three carriers, the U.S. Navy commissioned more than two dozen fleet and light fleet carriers, and numerous escort carriers.<br/>13. <strike>By 1942 the United States was already three years into a shipbuilding program mandated by the Second Vinson Act, intended to make the navy larger than Japan's.</strike><br/>14. The greater number of USN aviators survived the Battle of Midway and subsequent battles of 1942, and combined with growing pilot training programs, the US accumulated a large number of skilled pilots to complement its material advantages in ships and planes.<br/>"
Battle_of_Austerlitz-Endgame,4,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Battle of Austerlitz<br/>Section: Endgame<br/><br/>1. Meanwhile, the northernmost part of the battlefield was also witnessing heavy fighting.<br/>2. Prince Liechtenstein's heavy cavalry began to assault Kellerman's lighter cavalry forces after eventually arriving at the correct position in the field.<br/>3. The fighting initially went well for the French, but Kellerman's forces took cover behind General Caffarelli's infantry division once it became clear Russian numbers were too great.<br/>4. <strike>Caffarelli's men halted the Russian assaults and permitted Murat to send two cuirassier divisions (one commanded by d'Hautpoul and the other one by Nansouty) into the fray to finish off the Russian cavalry for good.</strike><br/>5. The ensuing mêlée was bitter and long, but the French ultimately prevailed.<br/>6. Lannes then led his V Corps against Bagration's men and after hard fighting managed to drive the skilled Russian commander off the field.<br/>7. He wanted to pursue, but Murat, who was in control of this sector in the battlefield, was against the idea.Napoleon's focus now shifted towards the southern end of the battlefield where the French and the Allies were still fighting over Sokolnitz and Telnitz.<br/>8. In an effective double-pronged assault, St. Hilaire's division and part of Davout's III Corps smashed through the enemy at Sokolnitz and persuaded the commanders of the first two columns, Generals Kienmayer and Langeron, to flee as fast as they could.<br/>9. Buxhowden, the commander of the Allied left and the man responsible for leading the attack, was completely drunk and fled as well.<br/>10. Kienmayer covered his withdrawal with the O'Reilly light cavalry, who gallantly managed to defeat five of six French cavalry regiments before they too had to retreat.General panic now seized the Allied army and it abandoned the field in all possible directions.<br/>11. A famous episode occurred during this retreat: Russian forces that had been defeated by the French right withdrew south towards Vienna via the Satschan frozen ponds.<br/>12. French artillery pounded towards the men, and the ice was broken due to the bombardment.<br/>13. The men drowned in the cold ponds, dozens of Russian artillery pieces going down with them.<br/>14. Estimates of how many guns were captured differ: there may have been as few as 38 or more than 100.<br/>15. Sources also differ about casualties, with figures ranging between 200 and 2,000 dead.<br/>16. Many drowning Russians were saved by their victorious foes.<br/>17. However, local evidence, only later made public, suggests that Napoleon's account of the catastrophe may have been totally invented; on the emperor's instructions the lakes were drained a few days after the battle and the corpses of only two or three men, with some 150 horses, were found.<br/>"
"Battle_of_Austerlitz-""War_and_Peace""",4,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Battle of Austerlitz<br/>Section: ""War and Peace""<br/><br/>1.

Tolstoy, who is known for his hatred of Napoléon, portrays Austerlitz as an early test for Russia, one which ended badly because the soldiers fought for irrelevant things like glory or renown rather than the higher virtues which would produce, according to Tolstoy, a victory at Borodino during the 1812 invasion.<br/>"

Unlike its many coalition partners, Britain remained at war throughout the period of the Napoleonic Wars.<br/>2. Protected by naval supremacy (in the words of Admiral Jervis to the House of Lords ""I do not say, my Lords, that the French will not come.<br/>3. I say only they will not come by sea""), Britain maintained low-intensity land warfare on a global scale for over a decade.<br/>4. The British government paid out large sums of money to other European states, so that they could pay armies in the field against France.<br/>5. These payments are colloquially known as the Golden Cavalry of St George.<br/>6. The British Army provided long-term support to the Spanish rebellion in the Peninsular War of 1808–1814, assisted by Spanish guerrilla ('little war') tactics.<br/>7. Anglo-Portuguese forces under Arthur Wellesley supported the Spanish, which campaigned successfully against the French armies, eventually driving them from Spain, thus allowing Britain to invade southern France.<br/>8. <strike>By 1815, the British Army played the central role in the final defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo.In 1802, Napoleon victoriously brought to an end the War of the Second Coalition, with only Great Britain remaining formally at war.</strike><br/>9. Isolated, Britain reluctantly agreed to end hostilities under the Treaty of Amiens (25 March 1802).Bonaparte tried to exploit the brief peace at sea to restore French colonial rule in Haiti.<br/>10. The expedition, though initially successful, would soon turn to a disaster, with the French commander Charles Leclerc, dying of yellow fever and almost his entire force destroyed by the disease.<br/>11. Napoleon gave up his New World dreams and sold Louisiana to the United States in 1803.Great Britain violated the terms of the Treaty of Amiens by occupying Malta and gathered a Third Coalition against France.<br/>12. The French intervention in the Swiss civil strife, a breach of the Treaty of Lunéville (1801) between France and the Holy Roman Empire which guaranteed Swiss sovereignty, was taken as a pretext by the British to break the peace of Amiens and declare war on France on 18 May 1803.<br/>13. The Coalition's war aims changed over the course of the conflict: a general desire to restore the French monarchy became closely linked to the struggle to stop Bonaparte.Beyond minor naval actions against British imperial interests, the Napoleonic Wars were much less global in scope than preceding conflicts such as Seven Years' War, which historians term a ""world war"".<br/>"
Napoleonic_Wars-War_of_the_Third_Coalition_1805,14,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Napoleonic Wars<br/>Section: War of the Third Coalition 1805<br/><br/>1. Britain gathered together allies to form the Third Coalition against France.<br/>2. In response, Napoleon seriously considered an invasion of Great Britain, and massed 180,000 effectives at Boulogne.<br/>3. However, before he could invade, he needed to achieve naval superiority—or at least to pull the British fleet away from the English Channel.<br/>4. A complex plan to distract the British by threatening their possessions in the West Indies failed when a Franco-Spanish fleet under Admiral Villeneuve turned back after an indecisive action off Cape Finisterre on 22 July 1805.<br/>5. The Royal Navy blockaded Villeneuve in Cádiz until he left for Naples on 19 October; the British squadron caught and overwhelmingly defeated the combined enemy fleet in the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October (the British commander, Lord Nelson, died in the battle).<br/>6. Napoleon would never again have the opportunity to challenge the British at sea, nor to threaten an invasion.<br/>7. He again turned his attention to enemies on the Continent.<br/>8. The French army left Boulogne and moved towards Austria.In April 1805, Britain and Russia signed a treaty with the aim of removing the French from the Batavian Republic (roughly present-day Netherlands) and the Swiss Confederation (Switzerland).<br/>9. Austria joined the alliance after the annexation of Genoa and the proclamation of Napoleon as King of Italy on 17 March 1805.<br/>10. Sweden, which had already agreed to lease Swedish Pomerania as a military base for British troops against France, formally entered the coalition on 9 August.The Austrians began the war by invading Bavaria with an army of about 70,000 under Karl Mack von Leiberich, and the French army marched out from Boulogne in late July 1805 to confront them.<br/>11. At Ulm (25 September – 20 October) Napoleon surrounded Mack's army, forcing its surrender without significant losses.<br/>12. With the main Austrian army north of the Alps defeated (another army under Archduke Charles manoeuvred inconclusively against André Masséna's French army in Italy), Napoleon occupied Vienna.<br/>13. Far from his supply lines, he faced a larger Austro-Russian army under the command of Mikhail Kutuzov, with the Emperor Alexander I of Russia personally present.<br/>14. <strike>On 2 December, Napoleon crushed the joint Austro-Russian army in Moravia at Austerlitz (usually considered his greatest victory).</strike><br/>15. He inflicted a total of 25,000 casualties on a numerically superior enemy army while sustaining fewer than 7,000 in his own force.Austria signed the Treaty of Pressburg (26 December 1805) and left the Coalition.<br/>16. The Treaty required the Austrians to give up Venetia to the French-dominated Kingdom of Italy and the Tyrol to Bavaria.With the withdrawal of Austria from the war, stalemate ensued.<br/>17. Napoleon's army had a record of continuous unbroken victories on land, but the full force of the Russian army had not yet come into play.<br/>"

The sinking of the RMS ""Titanic"" occurred on the night of 14 April through to the morning of 15 April 1912 in the north Atlantic Ocean, four days into her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City.<br/>2.

""Titanic"" received six warnings of sea ice on 14 April but was travelling near her maximum speed when her crew sighted the iceberg.<br/>5. Unable to turn quickly enough, the ship suffered a glancing blow that buckled her starboard (right) side and opened five of her sixteen compartments to the sea.<br/>6. ""Titanic"" had been designed to stay afloat with four of her forward compartments flooded but not more, and the crew soon realised that the ship would sink.<br/>7. They used rocket flares and radio (wireless) messages to attract help as the passengers were put into lifeboats.<br/>8. However, in accordance with existing maritime practice, the ship was carrying far too few lifeboats for everyone (though slightly more than the law required), and many boats were not filled to their capacity due to a poorly managed evacuation.The ship sank with over a thousand passengers and crew members still on board.<br/>9. Almost all those who jumped or fell into the water died from hypothermia within minutes.<br/>10. RMS ""Carpathia"" arrived on the scene about an hour and a half after the sinking and had rescued the last of the survivors in the lifeboats by 09:15 on 15 April, little more than 24 hours after ""Titanic""s crew had received their first warnings of drifting ice.<br/>11. The disaster caused widespread public outrage over the lack of lifeboats, lax shipping regulations, and the unequal treatment of the different passenger classes aboard the ship.<br/>12. Inquiries set up in the wake of the disaster recommended sweeping changes to maritime regulations.<br/>13. This led to the establishment in 1914 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), which still governs maritime safety today.<br/>"

The number of casualties of the sinking is unclear, due to a number of factors, including confusion over the passenger list, which included some names of people who cancelled their trip at the last minute, and the fact that several passengers travelled under aliases for various reasons and were double-counted on the casualty lists.<br/>2. The death toll has been put at between 1,490 and 1,635 people.<br/>3. The figures below are from the British Board of Trade report on the disaster.Less than a third of those aboard ""Titanic"" survived the disaster.<br/>4.

Although only 3 percent of first-class women were lost, 54% of those in third class died.<br/>8.

Standing on the steps of Memorial Church in Harvard Yard, he offered American aid to promote European recovery and reconstruction.<br/>4.

Aside from the demoralizing effect on the world at large and the possibilities of disturbances arising as a result of the desperation of the people concerned, the consequences to the economy of the United States should be apparent to all.<br/>9. It is logical that the United States should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health to the world, without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace.<br/>10. Our policy is not directed against any country, but against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos.<br/>11. Any government that is willing to assist in recovery will find full co-operation on the part of the USA.Its purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world so as to permit the emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can exist.Marshall was convinced that economic stability would provide political stability in Europe.<br/>12. He offered aid, but the European countries had to organize the program themselves.The speech, written by Charles Bohlen, contained virtually no details and no numbers.<br/>13. More a proposal than a plan, it was presented vaguely and made little impact in America.<br/>14. Eight weeks after the Harvard speech, the State Department wrote in a confidential memorandum that ""The Marshall Plan has been compared to a flying saucer — nobody knows what it looks like, how big it is, in what direction it is moving, or whether it really exists.""<br/>15. The most important element of the speech was the call for the Europeans to meet and create their own plan for rebuilding Europe, and that the United States would then fund this plan.<br/>16. The administration felt that the plan would likely be unpopular among many Americans, and the speech was mainly directed at a European audience.<br/>17. In an attempt to keep the speech out of American papers journalists were not contacted, and on the same day Truman called a press conference to take away headlines.<br/>18. In contrast, Dean Acheson, an Under Secretary of State, was dispatched to contact the European media, especially the British media, and the speech was read in its entirety on the BBC.<br/>"

Approach of the Imperial Japanese Army.Japanese war crimes on the march to Nanking.Although the Nanking Massacre is generally described as having occurred over a six-week period after the fall of Nanking, the crimes committed by the Japanese army were not limited to that period.<br/>2. Many atrocities were reported to have been committed as the Japanese army advanced from Shanghai to Nanking.According to one Japanese journalist embedded with Imperial forces at the time, ""The reason that the Army is advancing to Nanking quite rapidly is due to the tacit consent among the officers and men that they could loot and rape as they wish.<br/>3. ""Novelist Ishikawa Tatsuzo vividly described how the 16th Division of the Shanghai Expeditionary Force committed atrocities on the march between Shanghai and Nanking in his novel ""Ikiteiru Heitai"" (Living Soldiers), which was based on interviews that Tatsuzo conducted with troops in Nanking in January 1938.Perhaps the most notorious atrocity was a killing contest between two Japanese officers as reported in the ""Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun"" and the English language ""Japan Advertiser"".<br/>4. <strike>The contest— a race between the two officers (later executed for wartime atrocities) to see which of them could kill 100 people first using only a sword— was covered much like a sporting event with regular updates on the score over a series of days.</strike><br/>5. <strike>In Japan, the veracity of the newspaper article about the contest was the subject of ferocious debate for several decades starting in 1967.In 2000, a historian concurred with certain Japanese scholars who had argued that the contest was a concocted story, with the collusion of the soldiers themselves for the purpose of raising the national fighting spirit.</strike><br/>6. In 2005, a Tokyo district judge dismissed a suit by the families of the lieutenants, stating that ""the lieutenants admitted the fact that they raced to kill 100 people"" and that the story cannot be proven to be clearly false.<br/>7. The judge also ruled against the civil claim of the plaintiffs because the original article was more than 60 years old.<br/>8. The historicity of the event remains disputed in Japan.<br/>"

Some Japanese officials and writers have openly denied the incident, claiming it to be propaganda designed to spark an anti-Japan movement.<br/>8. In many ways, how ""atrocious"" the massacre was is the touchstone of left/right divide in Japan; i.e., leftists feel this is a defining moment of the Imperial Japanese Army; rightists believe Perry's opening of Japan and the atomic bombings are far more significant events.<br/>"
Balkan_Wars-Abstract,17,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Balkan Wars<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. The Balkan Wars were two conflicts that took place in the Balkan Peninsula in south-eastern Europe in 1912 and 1913.<br/>2. Four Balkan states defeated the Ottoman Empire in the first war; one of the four, Bulgaria, was defeated in the second war.<br/>3. The Ottoman Empire lost nearly all of its holdings in Europe.<br/>4. Austria-Hungary, although not a combatant, was weakened as a much enlarged Serbia pushed for union of the South Slavic peoples.<br/>5. The war set the stage for the Balkan crisis of 1914 and thus was a ""prelude to the First World War.<br/>6. ""By the early 20th century, Bulgaria, Greece, Montenegro and Serbia had achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire, but large elements of their ethnic populations remained under Ottoman rule.<br/>7. In 1912, these countries formed the Balkan League.<br/>8. There were three main causes of the First Balkan War.<br/>9. The Ottoman Empire was unable to reform itself, govern satisfactorily, or deal with the rising ethnic nationalism of its diverse peoples.<br/>10. Secondly the Great Powers quarreled amongst themselves and failed to ensure that the Ottomans would carry out the needed reforms.<br/>11. This led the Balkan states to impose their own solution.<br/>12. Most important, the Balkan League had been formed, and its members were confident that it could defeat the Turks.The Ottoman Empire lost almost all its European territories to the west of the River Maritsa, drawing present day Turkey's western border.<br/>13. A large influx of Turks started to flee into the Ottoman heartland as a result of the lost lands.<br/>14. By 1914, the remaining core region of the Ottoman Empire had experienced a population increase of around 2.5 million because of the flood of immigration from the Balkans.In Turkey, it is considered a major disaster (""Balkan harbi faciası"") in the nation's history.<br/>15. The unexpected fall and sudden relinquishing of Turkish-dominated European territories created a psycho-traumatic event amongst the Turks that is said to have triggered the ultimate collapse of the empire itself within five years.<br/>16. Nazım Pasha, the chief of staff of the Ottoman army has been held responsible of the failure and was assassinated in 1913 by Young Turks.The First Balkan War broke out when the League attacked the Ottoman Empire on 8 October 1912 and was ended seven months later by the Treaty of London.<br/>17. <strike>After five centuries, the Ottoman Empire lost virtually all of its possessions in the Balkans.The Second Balkan War broke out on 16 June 1913.</strike><br/>18. Bulgaria was dissatisfied over the division of the spoils in Macedonia, made in secret by its former allies, Serbia and Greece, and attacked them.<br/>19. The Serbian and Greek armies repulsed the Bulgarian offensive and counter-attacked into Bulgaria, while Romania and the Ottoman Empire also attacked Bulgaria and gained (or regained) territory.<br/>20. In the resulting Treaty of Bucharest, Bulgaria lost most of the territories it had gained in the First Balkan War.<br/>"

Serbia was frustrated in the north by Austria-Hungary's incorporation of Bosnia.<br/>2. In March 1909, Serbia was forced to accept the annexation and restrain anti-Habsburg agitation by Serbian nationalists.<br/>3. Instead, the Serbian government looked to formerly Serb territories in the south, notably ""Old Serbia"" (the Sanjak of Novi Pazar and the province of Kosovo).On 15 August 1909 the Military League, a group of Greek officers, took action against the government to reform their country's national government and reorganize the army.<br/>4. The League found itself unable to create a new political system, until the league summoned the Cretan politician Eleutherios Venizelos to Athens as its political adviser.<br/>5. <strike>Venizelos persuaded the king to revise the constitution and asked the League to disband in favor of a National Assembly.</strike><br/>6. In March 1910 the Military League dissolved itself.Bulgaria, which had secured Ottoman recognition of her independence in April 1909 and enjoyed the friendship of Russia, also looked to districts of Ottoman Thrace and Macedonia.<br/>7.

Battle_of_Moscow-Abstract,2,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Battle of Moscow<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. The Battle of Moscow is the name given by Soviet historians to two periods of strategically significant fighting on a sector of the Eastern Front during World War II.<br/>2. <strike>It took place between October 1941 and January 1942.</strike><br/>3. The Soviet defensive effort frustrated Hitler's attack on Moscow, capital of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and the largest Soviet city.<br/>4. Moscow was one of the primary military and political objectives for Axis forces in their invasion of the Soviet Union.The German strategic offensive named Operation Typhoon was planned to conduct two pincer offensives, one to the north of Moscow against the Kalinin Front by the 3rd and 4th Panzer Armies, simultaneously severing the Moscow–Leningrad railway, and another to the south of Moscow Oblast against the Western Front, south of Tula by the 2nd Panzer Army, while the 4th Army advanced directly towards Moscow from the west.<br/>5. A separate operational German plan, codenamed ""Operation Wotan"", was included in the final phase of the German offensive.Initially, the Soviet forces conducted a strategic defence of the Moscow Oblast by constructing three defensive belts, and deploying newly raised reserve armies as well as bringing troops from the Siberian and Far Eastern Military Districts.<br/>6. Subsequently, as the German offensives were halted, a Soviet strategic counter-offensive and smaller-scale offensive operations were executed to force German armies back to the positions around the cities of Oryol, Vyazma and Vitebsk, nearly surrounding three German armies in the process.<br/>"
Battle_of_Moscow-Aftermath,"17, 18","Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Battle of Moscow<br/>Section: Aftermath<br/><br/>1. The Red Army's winter counter-offensive drove the Wehrmacht from Moscow, but the city was still considered to be threatened, with the front line still relatively close.<br/>2. Because of this, the Moscow theater remained a priority for Stalin, who at first appeared to be in shock due to the initial German success.<br/>3. In particular, the initial Soviet advance was unable to level the Rzhev salient, held by several divisions of Army Group Center.<br/>4. Immediately after the Moscow counter-offensive, a series of Soviet attacks (the Battles of Rzhev) were attempted against the salient, each time with heavy losses on both sides.<br/>5. Soviet losses 776,000 men, and German losses between 500,000 and 780,000 men.<br/>6. By early 1943, the Wehrmacht had to disengage from the salient as the whole front was moving west.<br/>7. Nevertheless, the Moscow front was not finally secured until October 1943, when Army Group Center was decisively repulsed from the Smolensk landbridge and from the left shore of the upper Dnieper at the end of the Second Battle of Smolensk.Furious that his army had been unable to take Moscow, Hitler dismissed his commander-in-chief, Walther von Brauchitsch, on 19 December 1941, and took personal charge of the ""Wehrmacht"", effectively taking control of all military decisions and setting most experienced German officers against him.<br/>8. Additionally, Hitler surrounded himself with staff officers with little or no recent combat experience.<br/>9. As Guderian wrote in his memoirs, ""This created a cold (chill) in our relations, a cold (chill) that could never be eliminated afterwards.""<br/>10. This increased Hitler's distrust of his senior officers and severely reduced the German advantages due to their superior military leadership.<br/>11. Germany now faced the prospect of a war of attrition, something it was not prepared for and bound to lose in the long run.<br/>12. Overall, the battle was a stinging defeat for the Axis, though not necessarily a crushing one, and it ended German hopes for a quick and decisive victory over the Soviet Union.For the first time since June 1941, Soviet forces had stopped the Germans and driven them back.<br/>13. This resulted in Stalin becoming overconfident and deciding to further expand the offensive.<br/>14. On 5 January 1942, during a meeting in the Kremlin, Stalin announced that he was planning a general spring counteroffensive, which would be staged simultaneously near Moscow, Leningrad and in southern Russia.<br/>15. This plan was accepted over Zhukov's objections.<br/>16. Low Red Army reserves and Wehrmacht tactical skill led to a bloody stalemate near Rzhev, known as the ""Rzhev meat grinder"", and to a string of Red Army defeats, such as the Second Battle of Kharkov, the failed attempt at elimination of the Demyansk pocket, and the encirclement of General Vlasov's army near Leningrad in a failed attempt to lift the siege of the city.<br/>17. <strike>Ultimately, these failures would lead to a successful German offensive in the south and to the Battle of Stalingrad.Nevertheless, the defense of Moscow became a symbol of Soviet resistance against the invading Axis forces.</strike><br/>18. <strike>To commemorate the battle, Moscow was awarded the title of ""Hero City"" in 1965, on the 20th anniversary of Victory Day.</strike><br/>19. A Museum of the Defence of Moscow was created in 1995.<br/>"
Astronomy-Abstract,2,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Astronomy<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. Astronomy is a natural science that is the study of celestial objects (such as moons, planets, stars, nebulae, and galaxies), the physics, chemistry, and evolution of such objects, and phenomena that originate outside the atmosphere of Earth, including supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic background radiation.<br/>2. <strike>A related but distinct subject, cosmology, is concerned with studying the universe as a whole.</strike><br/>3. Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences.<br/>4. Prehistoric cultures have left astronomical artifacts such as the Egyptian monuments and Nubian monuments, and early civilizations such as the Babylonians, Greeks, Chinese, Indians, Iranians and Maya performed methodical observations of the night sky.<br/>5. However, the invention of the telescope was required before astronomy was able to develop into a modern science.<br/>6. Historically, astronomy has included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, observational astronomy, and the making of calendars, but professional astronomy is nowadays often considered to be synonymous with astrophysics.<br/>7. During the 20th century, the field of professional astronomy split into observational and theoretical branches.<br/>8. Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects, which is then analyzed using basic principles of physics.<br/>9. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena.<br/>10. The two fields complement each other, with theoretical astronomy seeking to explain the observational results and observations being used to confirm theoretical results.Astronomy is one of the few sciences where amateurs can still play an active role, especially in the discovery and observation of transient phenomena.<br/>11. Amateur astronomers have contributed to many important astronomical discoveries.<br/>12. Astronomy is not to be confused with astrology, the belief system which claims that human affairs are correlated with the positions of celestial objects.<br/>13. Although the two fields share a common origin they are now entirely distinct.<br/>"
Astronomy-Astrometry_and_celestial_mechanics,3,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Astronomy<br/>Section: Astrometry and celestial mechanics<br/><br/>1. One of the oldest fields in astronomy, and in all of science, is the measurement of the positions of celestial objects.<br/>2. Historically, accurate knowledge of the positions of the Sun, Moon, planets and stars has been essential in celestial navigation (the use of celestial objects to guide navigation) and in the making of calendars.Careful measurement of the positions of the planets has led to a solid understanding of gravitational perturbations, and an ability to determine past and future positions of the planets with great accuracy, a field known as celestial mechanics.<br/>3. <strike>More recently the tracking of near-Earth objects will allow for predictions of close encounters, and potential collisions, with the Earth.The measurement of stellar parallax of nearby stars provides a fundamental baseline in the cosmic distance ladder that is used to measure the scale of the universe.</strike><br/>4. Parallax measurements of nearby stars provide an absolute baseline for the properties of more distant stars, as their properties can be compared.<br/>5. Measurements of radial velocity and proper motion plot the movement of these systems through the Milky Way galaxy.<br/>6. Astrometric results are the basis used to calculate the distribution of dark matter in the galaxy.During the 1990s, the measurement of the stellar wobble of nearby stars was used to detect large extrasolar planets orbiting nearby stars.<br/>"
Chemistry-Chemistry_as_science,10,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Chemistry<br/>Section: Chemistry as science<br/><br/>1.  as science.Under the influence of the new empirical methods propounded by Sir Francis Bacon and others, a group of chemists at Oxford, Robert Boyle, Robert Hooke and John Mayow began to reshape the old alchemical traditions into a scientific discipline.<br/>2. Boyle in particular is regarded as the founding father of chemistry due to his most important work, the classic chemistry text ""The Sceptical Chymist"" where the differentiation is made between the claims of alchemy and the empirical scientific discoveries of the new chemistry.<br/>3. He formulated Boyle's law, rejected the classical ""four elements"" and proposed a mechanistic alternative of atoms and chemical reactions that could be subject to rigorous experiment.The theory of phlogiston (a substance at the root of all combustion) was propounded by the German Georg Ernst Stahl in the early 18th century and was only overturned by the end of the century by the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier, the chemical analogue of Newton in physics; who did more than any other to establish the new science on proper theoretical footing, by elucidating the principle of conservation of mass and developing a new system of chemical nomenclature used to this day.Prior to his work, though, many important discoveries had been made, specifically relating to the nature of 'air' which was discovered to be composed of many different gases.<br/>4. The Scottish chemist Joseph Black (the first experimental chemist) and the Dutchman J.<br/>5. B. van Helmont discovered carbon dioxide, or what Black called 'fixed air' in 1754; Henry Cavendish discovered hydrogen and elucidated its properties and Joseph Priestley and, independently, Carl Wilhelm Scheele isolated pure oxygen.English scientist John Dalton proposed the modern theory of atoms; that all substances are composed of indivisible 'atoms' of matter and that different atoms have varying atomic weights.The development of the electrochemical theory of chemical combinations occurred in the early 19th century as the result of the work of two scientists in particular, J. J. Berzelius and Humphry Davy, made possible by the prior invention of the voltaic pile by Alessandro Volta.<br/>6. Davy discovered nine new elements including the alkali metals by extracting them from their oxides with electric current.British William Prout first proposed ordering all the elements by their atomic weight as all atoms had a weight that was an exact multiple of the atomic weight of hydrogen.<br/>7. J.<br/>8. A. R. Newlands devised an early table of elements, which was then developed into the modern periodic table of elements by the German Julius Lothar Meyer and the Russian Dmitri Mendeleev in the 1860s.<br/>9. The inert gases, later called the noble gases were discovered by William Ramsay in collaboration with Lord Rayleigh at the end of the century, thereby filling in the basic structure of the table.Organic chemistry was developed by Justus von Liebig and others, following Friedrich Wöhler's synthesis of urea which proved that living organisms were, in theory, reducible to chemistry.<br/>10. <strike>Other crucial 19th century advances were; an understanding of valence bonding (Edward Frankland in 1852) and the application of thermodynamics to chemistry (J. W. Gibbs and Svante Arrhenius in the 1870s).</strike><br/>"
Chemistry-Bonding,11,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Chemistry<br/>Section: Bonding<br/><br/>1. Atoms sticking together in molecules or crystals are said to be bonded with one another.<br/>2. A chemical bond may be visualized as the multipole balance between the positive charges in the nuclei and the negative charges oscillating about them.<br/>3. More than simple attraction and repulsion, the energies and distributions characterize the availability of an electron to bond to another atom.A chemical bond can be a covalent bond, an ionic bond, a hydrogen bond or just because of Van der Waals force.<br/>4. Each of these kinds of bonds is ascribed to some potential.<br/>5. These potentials create the interactions which hold atoms together in molecules or crystals.<br/>6. In many simple compounds, Valence Bond Theory, the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion model (VSEPR), and the concept of oxidation number can be used to explain molecular structure and composition.An ionic bond is formed when a metal loses one or more of its electrons, becoming a positively charged cation, and the electrons are then gained by the non-metal atom, becoming a negatively charged anion.<br/>7. The two oppositely charged ions attract one another, and the ionic bond is the electrostatic force of attraction between them.<br/>8. For example, sodium (Na), a metal, loses one electron to become an Na+ cation while chlorine (Cl), a non-metal, gains this electron to become Cl-.<br/>9. The ions are held together due to electrostatic attraction, and that compound sodium chloride (NaCl), or common table salt, is formed.In a covalent bond, one or more pairs of valence electrons are shared by two atoms: the resulting electrically neutral group of bonded atoms is termed a molecule.<br/>10. Atoms will share valence electrons in such a way as to create a noble gas electron configuration (eight electrons in their outermost shell) for each atom.<br/>11. <strike>Atoms that tend to combine in such a way that they each have eight electrons in their valence shell are said to follow the octet rule.</strike><br/>12. However, some elements like hydrogen and lithium need only two electrons in their outermost shell to attain this stable configuration; these atoms are said to follow the ""duet rule"", and in this way they are reaching the electron configuration of the noble gas helium, which has two electrons in its outer shell.Similarly, theories from classical physics can be used to predict many ionic structures.<br/>13. With more complicated compounds, such as metal complexes, valence bond theory is less applicable and alternative approaches, such as the molecular orbital theory, are generally used.<br/>14.

Computer_science-Education,6,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Computer science<br/>Section: Education<br/><br/>1. Some universities teach computer science as a theoretical study of computation and algorithmic reasoning.<br/>2. These programs often feature the theory of computation, analysis of algorithms, formal methods, concurrency theory, databases, computer graphics, and systems analysis, among others.<br/>3. They typically also teach computer programming, but treat it as a vessel for the support of other fields of computer science rather than a central focus of high-level study.<br/>4. The ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Curriculum Task Force ""Computing Curriculum 2005"" (and 2008 update) gives a guideline for university curriculum.Other colleges and universities, as well as secondary schools and vocational programs that teach computer science, emphasize the practice of advanced programming rather than the theory of algorithms and computation in their computer science curricula.<br/>5. Such curricula tend to focus on those skills that are important to workers entering the software industry.<br/>6. <strike>The process aspects of computer programming are often referred to as software engineering.While computer science professions increasingly drive the U.S. economy, computer science education is absent in most American K-12 curricula.</strike><br/>7. A report entitled ""Running on Empty: The Failure to Teach K-12 Computer Science in the Digital Age"" was released in October 2010 by Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA), and revealed that only 14 states have adopted significant education standards for high school computer science.<br/>8. The report also found that only nine states count high school computer science courses as a core academic subject in their graduation requirements.<br/>9. In tandem with ""Running on Empty"", a new non-partisan advocacy coalition - Computing in the Core (CinC) - was founded to influence federal and state policy, such as the Computer Science Education Act, which calls for grants to states to develop plans for improving computer science education and supporting computer science teachers.Within the United States a gender gap in computer science education has been observed as well.<br/>10. Research conducted by the WGBH Educational Foundation and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) revealed that more than twice as many high school boys considered computer science to be a “very good” or “good” college major than high school girls.<br/>11. In addition, the high school Advanced Placement (AP) exam for computer science has displayed a disparity in gender.<br/>12. Compared to other AP subjects it has the lowest number of female participants, with a composition of about 15 percent women.<br/>13. This gender gap in computer science is further witnessed at the college level, where 31 percent of undergraduate computer science degrees are earned by women and only 8 percent of computer science faculty consists of women.<br/>14. According to an article published by the Epistemic Games Group in August 2012, the number of women graduates in the computer science field has declined to 13 percent.<br/>"
Astrophysics-History,7,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Astrophysics<br/>Section: History<br/><br/>1. Although astronomy is as ancient as recorded history itself, it was long separated from the study of terrestrial physics.<br/>2. In the Aristotelian worldview, bodies in the sky appeared to be unchanging spheres whose only motion was uniform motion in a circle, while the earthly world was the realm which underwent growth and decay and in which natural motion was in a straight line and ended when the moving object reached its goal.<br/>3. Consequently, it was held that the celestial region was made of a fundamentally different kind of matter from that found in the terrestrial sphere; either Fire as maintained by Plato, or Aether as maintained by Aristotle.In the 17th century, natural philosophers such as Galileo, Descartes, and Newton began to maintain that the celestial and terrestrial regions were made of similar kinds of material and were subject to the same natural laws.At the end of the 19th century, it was discovered that, when decomposing the light from the Sun, a multitude of spectral lines were observed (regions where there was less or no light).<br/>4. Laboratory experiments with hot gases showed that the same lines could be observed in the spectra of known gases, specific lines corresponding to unique chemical elements.<br/>5. In this way it was proved that the chemical elements found in the Sun and stars (chiefly hydrogen) were also found on Earth.<br/>6. Indeed, the element helium was first discovered in the spectrum of the Sun and only later found on Earth, hence its name.<br/>7. <strike>During the 20th century, spectroscopy (the study of these spectral lines) advanced, particularly as a result of the advent of quantum physics that was necessary to understand the astronomical and experimental observations.See also:</strike><br/>8. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Timeline of knowledge about galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and large-scale structure<br/>9. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Timeline of white dwarfs, neutron stars, and supernovae<br/>10. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Timeline of black hole physics<br/>11. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Timeline of gravitational physics and relativity<br/>"
Astrophysics-Theoretical_astrophysics,8,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Astrophysics<br/>Section: Theoretical astrophysics<br/><br/>1. Theoretical astrophysicists use a wide variety of tools which include analytical models (for example, polytropes to approximate the behaviors of a star) and computational numerical simulations.<br/>2. Each has some advantages.<br/>3. Analytical models of a process are generally better for giving insight into the heart of what is going on.<br/>4. Numerical models can reveal the existence of phenomena and effects that would otherwise not be seen.Theorists in astrophysics endeavor to create theoretical models and figure out the observational consequences of those models.<br/>5. This helps allow observers to look for data that can refute a model or help in choosing between several alternate or conflicting models.Theorists also try to generate or modify models to take into account new data.<br/>6. In the case of an inconsistency, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model to fit the data.<br/>7. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.Topics studied by theoretical astrophysicists include: stellar dynamics and evolution; galaxy formation and evolution; magnetohydrodynamics; large-scale structure of matter in the universe; origin of cosmic rays; general relativity and physical cosmology, including string cosmology and astroparticle physics.<br/>8. <strike>Astrophysical relativity serves as a tool to gauge the properties of large scale structures for which gravitation plays a significant role in physical phenomena investigated and as the basis for black hole (""astro"")physics and the study of gravitational waves.Some widely accepted and studied theories and models in astrophysics, now included in the Lambda-CDM model are the Big Bang, Cosmic inflation, dark matter, dark energy and fundamental theories of physics.</strike><br/>9.

Thermodynamics-States_and_processes,5,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Thermodynamics<br/>Section: States and processes<br/><br/>1. There are three fundamental kinds of entity in thermodynamics, states of a system, processes of a system, and thermodynamic operations.<br/>2. This allows three fundamental approaches to thermodynamic reasoning, that in terms of states of thermodynamic equilibrium of a system, and that in terms of time-invariant processes of a system, and that in terms of cyclic processes of a system.The approach through states of thermodynamic equilibrium of a system requires a full account of the state of the system as well as a notion of process from one state to another of a system, but may require only an idealized or partial account of the state of the surroundings of the system or of other systems.The method of description in terms of states of thermodynamic equilibrium has limitations.<br/>3. For example, processes in a region of turbulent flow, or in a burning gas mixture, or in a Knudsen gas may be beyond ""the province of thermodynamics"".<br/>4. This problem can sometimes be circumvented through the method of description in terms of cyclic or of time-invariant flow processes.<br/>5. <strike>This is part of the reason why the founders of thermodynamics often preferred the cyclic process description.Approaches through processes of time-invariant flow of a system are used for some studies.</strike><br/>6. Some processes, for example Joule-Thomson expansion, are studied through steady-flow experiments, but can be accounted for by distinguishing the steady bulk flow kinetic energy from the internal energy, and thus can be regarded as within the scope of classical thermodynamics defined in terms of equilibrium states or of cyclic processes.<br/>7. Other flow processes, for example thermoelectric effects, are essentially defined by the presence of differential flows or diffusion so that they cannot be adequately accounted for in terms of equilibrium states or classical cyclic processes.The notion of a cyclic process does not require a full account of the state of the system, but does require a full account of how the process occasions transfers of matter and energy between the principal system (which is often called the ""working body"") and its surroundings, which must include at least two heat reservoirs at different known and fixed temperatures, one hotter than the principal system and the other colder than it, as well as a reservoir that can receive energy from the system as work and can do work on the system.<br/>8. The reservoirs can alternatively be regarded as auxiliary idealized component systems, alongside the principal system.<br/>9. Thus an account in terms of cyclic processes requires at least four contributory component systems.<br/>10. The independent variables of this account are the amounts of energy that enter and leave the idealized auxiliary systems.<br/>11. In this kind of account, the working body is often regarded as a ""black box"", and its own state is not specified.<br/>12. In this approach, the notion of a properly numerical scale of empirical temperature is a presupposition of thermodynamics, not a notion constructed by or derived from it.<br/>"
Thermodynamics-Potentials,4,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Thermodynamics<br/>Section: Potentials<br/><br/>1. Thermodynamic potentials are different quantitative measures of the stored energy in a system.<br/>2. Potentials are used to measure energy changes in systems as they evolve from an initial state to a final state.<br/>3. The potential used depends on the constraints of the system, such as constant temperature or pressure.<br/>4. <strike>For example, the Helmholtz and Gibbs energies are the energies available in a system to do useful work when the temperature and volume or the pressure and temperature are fixed, respectively.The five most well known potentials are:where formula_1 is the temperature, formula_2 the entropy, formula_3 the pressure, formula_4 the volume, formula_5 the chemical potential, formula_6 the number of particles in the system, and formula_7 is the count of particles types in the system.Thermodynamic potentials can be derived from the energy balance equation applied to a thermodynamic system.</strike><br/>5. Other thermodynamic potentials can also be obtained through Legendre transformation.<br/>"
Quantum_mechanics-Abstract,1,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Quantum mechanics<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. <strike>Quantum mechanics (QM – also known as quantum physics, or quantum theory) is a branch of physics which deals with physical phenomena at nanoscopic scales where the action is on the order of the Planck constant.</strike><br/>2. It departs from classical mechanics primarily at the ""quantum realm"" of atomic and subatomic length scales.<br/>3. Quantum mechanics provides a mathematical description of much of the dual ""particle-like"" and ""wave-like"" behavior and interactions of energy and matter.<br/>4. Quantum mechanics provides a substantially useful framework for many features of the modern periodic table of elements including the behavior of atoms during chemical bonding and has played a significant role in the development of many modern technologies.In advanced topics of quantum mechanics, some of these behaviors are macroscopic (see macroscopic quantum phenomena) and emerge at only extreme (i.e., very low or very high) energies or temperatures (such as in the use of superconducting magnets).<br/>5. For example, the angular momentum of an electron bound to an atom or molecule is quantized.<br/>6. In contrast, the angular momentum of an unbound electron is not quantized.<br/>7. In the context of quantum mechanics, the wave–particle duality of energy and matter and the uncertainty principle provide a unified view of the behavior of photons, electrons, and other atomic-scale objects.The mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics are abstract.<br/>8. A mathematical function, the wavefunction, provides information about the probability amplitude of position, momentum, and other physical properties of a particle.<br/>9. Mathematical manipulations of the wavefunction usually involve bra–ket notation which requires an understanding of complex numbers and linear functionals.<br/>10. The wavefunction formulation treats the particle as a quantum harmonic oscillator, and the mathematics is akin to that describing acoustic resonance.<br/>11. Many of the results of quantum mechanics are not easily visualized in terms of classical mechanics.<br/>12. For instance, in a quantum mechanical model the lowest energy state of a system, the ground state, is non-zero as opposed to a more ""traditional"" ground state with zero kinetic energy (all particles at rest).<br/>13. Instead of a traditional static, unchanging zero energy state, quantum mechanics allows for far more dynamic, chaotic possibilities, according to John Wheeler.The earliest versions of quantum mechanics were formulated in the first decade of the 20th century.<br/>14. About this time, the atomic theory and the corpuscular theory of light (as updated by Einstein) first came to be widely accepted as scientific fact; these latter theories can be viewed as quantum theories of matter and electromagnetic radiation, respectively.<br/>15. Early quantum theory was significantly reformulated in the mid-1920s by Werner Heisenberg, Max Born and Pascual Jordan, (matrix mechanics); Louis de Broglie and Erwin Schrödinger (wave mechanics); and Wolfgang Pauli and Satyendra Nath Bose (statistics of subatomic particles).<br/>16. Moreover, the Copenhagen interpretation of Niels Bohr became widely accepted.<br/>17. By 1930, quantum mechanics had been further unified and formalized by the work of David Hilbert, Paul Dirac and John von Neumann with a greater emphasis placed on measurement in quantum mechanics, the statistical nature of our knowledge of reality, and philosophical speculation about the role of the observer.<br/>18. Quantum mechanics has since permeated throughout many aspects of 20th-century physics and other disciplines including quantum chemistry, quantum electronics, quantum optics, and quantum information science.<br/>19. Much 19th-century physics has been re-evaluated as the ""classical limit"" of quantum mechanics and its more advanced developments in terms of quantum field theory, string theory, and speculative quantum gravity theories.The name ""quantum mechanics"" derives from the observation that some physical quantities can change only in ""discrete"" amounts (Latin ""quanta""), and not in a continuous (""cf.""<br/>20. analog) way.<br/>"

According to the correspondence principle between classical and quantum mechanics, all objects obey the laws of quantum mechanics, and classical mechanics is just an approximation for large systems of objects (or a statistical quantum mechanics of a large collection of particles).<br/>3. The laws of classical mechanics thus follow from the laws of quantum mechanics as a statistical average at the limit of large systems or large quantum numbers.<br/>4. However, chaotic systems do not have good quantum numbers, and quantum chaos studies the relationship between classical and quantum descriptions in these systems.Quantum coherence is an essential difference between classical and quantum theories as illustrated by the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) paradox — an attempt to disprove quantum mechanics by an appeal to local realism.<br/>5. <strike>Quantum interference involves adding together ""probability amplitudes"", whereas classical ""waves"" infer that there is an adding together of ""intensities"".</strike><br/>6. For microscopic bodies, the extension of the system is much smaller than the coherence length, which gives rise to long-range entanglement and other nonlocal phenomena characteristic of quantum systems.<br/>7. Quantum coherence is not typically evident at macroscopic scales, though an exception to this rule may occur at extremely low temperatures (i.e.<br/>8. approaching absolute zero) at which quantum behavior may manifest itself macroscopically.<br/>9. This is in accordance with the following observations:<br/>10. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many macroscopic properties of a classical system are a direct consequence of the quantum behavior of its parts.<br/>11. For example, the stability of bulk matter (consisting of atoms and molecules which would quickly collapse under electric forces alone), the rigidity of solids, and the mechanical, thermal, chemical, optical and magnetic properties of matter are all results of the interaction of electric charges under the rules of quantum mechanics.<br/>12. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the seemingly ""exotic"" behavior of matter posited by quantum mechanics and relativity theory become more apparent when dealing with particles of extremely small size or velocities approaching the speed of light, the laws of classical, often considered ""Newtonian"", physics remain accurate in predicting the behavior of the vast majority of ""large"" objects (on the order of the size of large molecules or bigger) at velocities much smaller than the velocity of light.<br/>"
Electromagnetism-Abstract,4,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Electromagnetism<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. Electromagnetism, or the electromagnetic force is one of the four fundamental interactions in nature, the other three being the strong interaction, the weak interaction, and gravitation.<br/>2. This force is described by electromagnetic fields, and has innumerable physical instances including the interaction of electrically charged particles and the interaction of uncharged magnetic force fields with electrical conductors.The word ""electromagnetism"" is a compound form of two Greek terms, ἢλεκτρον, ""ēlektron"", ""amber"", and μαγνήτης, ""magnetic"", from ""magnítis líthos"" (μαγνήτης λίθος), which means ""magnesian stone"", a type of iron ore.<br/>3. The science of electromagnetic phenomena is defined in terms of the electromagnetic force, sometimes called the Lorentz force, which includes both electricity and magnetism as elements of one phenomenon.During the quark epoch, the electroweak force split into the electromagnetic and weak force.<br/>4. <strike>The electromagnetic force plays a major role in determining the internal properties of most objects encountered in daily life.</strike><br/>5. Ordinary matter takes its form as a result of intermolecular forces between individual molecules in matter.<br/>6. Electrons are bound by electromagnetic wave mechanics into orbitals around atomic nuclei to form atoms, which are the building blocks of molecules.<br/>7. This governs the processes involved in chemistry, which arise from interactions between the electrons of neighboring atoms, which are in turn determined by the interaction between electromagnetic force and the momentum of the electrons.There are numerous mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field.<br/>8. In classical electrodynamics, electric fields are described as electric potential and electric current in Ohm's law, magnetic fields are associated with electromagnetic induction and magnetism, and Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated and altered by each other and by charges and currents.The theoretical implications of electromagnetism, in particular the establishment of the speed of light based on properties of the ""medium"" of propagation (permeability and permittivity), led to the development of special relativity by Albert Einstein in 1905.<br/>"
Electromagnetism-Photoelectric_effect,5,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Electromagnetism<br/>Section: Photoelectric effect<br/><br/>1. In another paper published in that same year, Albert Einstein undermined the very foundations of classical electromagnetism.<br/>2. In his theory of the photoelectric effect (for which he won the Nobel prize for physics) and inspired by the idea of Max Planck's ""quanta"", he posited that light could exist in discrete particle-like quantities as well, which later came to be known as photons.<br/>3. Einstein's theory of the photoelectric effect extended the insights that appeared in the solution of the ultraviolet catastrophe presented by Max Planck in 1900.<br/>4. In his work, Planck showed that hot objects emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete packets (""quanta""), which leads to a finite total energy emitted as black body radiation.<br/>5. <strike>Both of these results were in direct contradiction with the classical view of light as a continuous wave.</strike><br/>6. Planck's and Einstein's theories were progenitors of quantum mechanics, which, when formulated in 1925, necessitated the invention of a quantum theory of electromagnetism.<br/>7. This theory, completed in the 1940s-1950s, is known as quantum electrodynamics (or ""QED""), and, in situations where perturbation theory is applicable, is one of the most accurate theories known to physics.<br/>"

These papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist.<br/>5.

Photoelectric_effect-Experimental_observations_of_photoelectric_emission,5,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Photoelectric effect<br/>Section: Experimental observations of photoelectric emission<br/><br/>1. The theory of the photoelectric effect must explain the experimental observations of the emission of electrons from an illuminated metal surface.For a given metal, there exists a certain minimum frequency of incident radiation below which no photoelectrons are emitted.<br/>2. This frequency is called the ""threshold frequency"".<br/>3. Increasing the frequency of the incident beam, keeping the number of incident photons fixed (this would result in a proportionate increase in energy) increases the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons emitted.<br/>4. Thus the stopping voltage increases.<br/>5. <strike>The number of electrons also changes because the probability that each photon results in an emitted electron is a function of photon energy.</strike><br/>6. If the intensity of the incident radiation is increased, there is no effect on the kinetic energies of the photoelectrons.Above the threshold frequency, the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectron depends on the frequency of the incident light, but is independent of the intensity of the incident light so long as the latter is not too high.For a given metal and frequency of incident radiation, the rate at which photoelectrons are ejected is directly proportional to the intensity of the incident light.<br/>7. Increase in intensity of incident beam (keeping the frequency fixed) increases the magnitude of the photoelectric current, though stopping voltage remains the same.The time lag between the incidence of radiation and the emission of a photoelectron is very small, less than 10−9 second.The direction of distribution of emitted electrons peaks in the direction of polarization (the direction of the electric field) of the incident light, if it is linearly polarized.<br/>"

The decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen can be performed in an electrolytic cell.<br/>4. In it, a pair of inert electrodes usually made of platinum immersed in water act as anode and cathode in the electrolytic process.<br/>5. The electrolysis starts with the application of an external voltage between the electrodes.<br/>6. This process will not occur except at extremely high voltages without an electrolyte such as sodium chloride or sulfuric acid (most used 0.1 M).Bubbles from the gases will be seen near both electrodes.<br/>7. The following half reactions describe the process mentioned above:<br/>8. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Anode (oxidation)"": 2 H2O(l) → O2(g) + 4 H+(aq) + 4 e–<br/>9. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Cathode (reduction)"": 2 H2O(g) + 2 e– → H2(g) + 2 OH–(aq)<br/>10. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Overall reaction"": 2 H2O(l) → 2 H2(g) + O2(g)<br/><br/>11.

Atomic_number-Abstract,9,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Atomic number<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. In chemistry and physics, the atomic number of a chemical element (also known as its proton number) is the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom of that element, and therefore identical to the charge number of the nucleus.<br/>2. It is conventionally represented by the symbol Z.<br/>3. The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element.<br/>4. In an uncharged atom, the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons.The atomic number, ""Z"", should not be confused with the mass number, ""A"", which is the number of nucleons, the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom.<br/>5. The number of neutrons, ""N"", is known as the neutron number of the atom; thus, ""A"" = ""Z"" + ""N"" (these quantities are always whole numbers).<br/>6. Since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass (and the mass of the electrons is negligible for many purposes) and the mass defect of nucleon binding is always small compared to the nucleon mass, the atomic mass of any atom, when expressed in unified atomic mass units (making a quantity called the ""relative isotopic mass,"") is roughly (to within 1%) equal to the whole number ""A"".Atoms with the same atomic number ""Z"" but different neutron numbers ""N"", and hence different atomic masses, are known as isotopes.<br/>7. A little more than three-quarters of naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes (see monoisotopic elements), and the average isotopic mass of an isotopic mixture for an element (called the relative atomic mass) in a defined environment on Earth, determines the element's standard atomic weight.<br/>8. Historically, it was these atomic weights of elements (in comparison to hydrogen) that were the quantities measurable by chemists in the 19th century.The conventional symbol ""Z"" comes from the German word meaning number/numeral/figure, which, prior to the modern synthesis of ideas from chemistry and physics, merely denoted an element's numerical place in the periodic table, whose order is approximately, but not completely, consistent with the order of the elements by atomic weights.<br/>9. <strike>Only after 1915, with the suggestion and evidence that this ""Z"" number was also the nuclear charge and a physical characteristic of atoms, did the word (and its English equivalent ""atomic number"") come into common use in this context.</strike><br/>"
Atomic_number-Moseley's_1913_experiment,1,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Atomic number<br/>Section: Moseley's 1913 experiment<br/><br/>1. <strike>The experimental position improved dramatically after research by Henry Moseley in 1913.</strike><br/>2. Moseley, after discussions with Bohr who was at the same lab (and who had used Van den Broek's hypothesis in his Bohr model of the atom), decided to test Van den Broek's and Bohr's hypothesis directly, by seeing if spectral lines emitted from excited atoms fitted the Bohr theory's postulation that the frequency of the spectral lines be proportional to the square of ""Z"".To do this, Moseley measured the wavelengths of the innermost photon transitions (K and L lines) produced by the elements from aluminum (""Z"" = 13) to gold (""Z"" = 79) used as a series of movable anodic targets inside an x-ray tube.<br/>3. The square root of the frequency of these photons (x-rays) increased from one target to the next in an arithmetic progression.<br/>4. This led to the conclusion (Moseley's law) that the atomic number does closely correspond (with an offset of one unit for K-lines, in Moseley's work) to the calculated electric charge of the nucleus, i.e.<br/>5. the element number ""Z"".<br/>6. Among other things, Moseley demonstrated that the lanthanide series (from lanthanum to lutetium inclusive) must have 15 members—no fewer and no more—which was far from obvious from the chemistry at that time.<br/>"
Gravitational_wave-Introduction,18,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Gravitational wave<br/>Section: Introduction<br/><br/>1. In Einstein's theory of general relativity, gravity is treated as a phenomenon resulting from the curvature of spacetime.<br/>2. This curvature is caused by the presence of mass.<br/>3. Generally, the more mass that is contained within a given volume of space, the greater the curvature of spacetime will be at the boundary of this volume.<br/>4. As objects with mass move around in spacetime, the curvature changes to reflect the changed locations of those objects.<br/>5. In certain circumstances, accelerating objects generate changes in this curvature, which propagate outwards at the speed of light in a wave-like manner.<br/>6. These propagating phenomena are known as gravitational waves.As a gravitational wave passes a distant observer, that observer will find spacetime distorted by the effects of strain.<br/>7. Distances between free objects increase and decrease rhythmically as the wave passes, at a frequency corresponding to that of the wave.<br/>8. This occurs despite such free objects never being subjected to an unbalanced force.<br/>9. The magnitude of this effect decreases inversely with distance from the source.<br/>10. Inspiralling binary neutron stars are predicted to be a powerful source of gravitational waves as they coalesce, due to the very large acceleration of their masses as they orbit close to one another.<br/>11. However, due to the astronomical distances to these sources the effects when measured on Earth are predicted to be very small, having strains of less than 1 part in 1020.<br/>12. Scientists are attempting to demonstrate the existence of these waves with ever more sensitive detectors.<br/>13. The current most sensitive measurement is about one part in (as of 2012) provided by the LIGO and VIRGO observatories.<br/>14. The lack of detection in these observatories provides an upper limit on the frequency of such powerful sources.<br/>15. A space based observatory, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, is currently under development by ESA.Gravitational waves should penetrate regions of space that electromagnetic waves cannot.<br/>16. It is hypothesized that they will be able to provide observers on Earth with information about black holes and other exotic objects in the distant Universe.<br/>17. Such systems cannot be observed with more traditional means such as optical telescopes and radio telescopes.<br/>18. <strike>In particular, gravitational waves could be of interest to cosmologists as they offer a possible way of observing the very early universe.</strike><br/>19. This is not possible with conventional astronomy, since before recombination the universe was opaque to electromagnetic radiation.<br/>20. Precise measurements of gravitational waves will also allow scientists to test the general theory of relativity more thoroughly.In principle, gravitational waves could exist at any frequency.<br/>21. However, very low frequency waves would be impossible to detect and there is no credible source for detectable waves of very high frequency.<br/>22. Stephen W. Hawking and Werner Israel list different frequency bands for gravitational waves that could be plausibly detected, ranging from 10−7 Hz up to 1011 Hz.<br/>"
Gravitational_wave-Radiation_from_other_sources,7,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Gravitational wave<br/>Section: Radiation from other sources<br/><br/>1. Although the waves from the Earth-Sun system are minuscule, astronomers can point to other sources for which the radiation should be substantial.<br/>2. One important example is the Hulse-Taylor binary — a pair of stars, one of which is a pulsar.<br/>3. The characteristics of their orbit can be deduced from the Doppler shifting of radio signals given off by the pulsar.<br/>4. Each of the stars has a mass about 1.4 times that of the Sun and the size of their orbit is about 1/75 of the Earth-Sun orbit.<br/>5. This means the distance between the two stars is just a few times larger than the diameter of our own Sun.<br/>6. The combination of greater masses and smaller separation means that the energy given off by the Hulse-Taylor binary will be far greater than the energy given off by the Earth-Sun system — roughly 1022 times as much.The information about the orbit can be used to predict just how much energy (and angular momentum) should be given off in the form of gravitational waves.<br/>7. <strike>As the energy is carried off, the stars should draw closer to each other.</strike><br/>8. This effect is called an inspiral, and it can be observed in the pulsar's signals.<br/>9. The measurements on the Hulse-Taylor system have been carried out over more than 30 years.<br/>10. It has been shown that the gravitational radiation predicted by general relativity allows these observations to be matched within 0.2 percent.<br/>11. In 1993, Russell Hulse and Joe Taylor were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this work, which was the first indirect evidence for gravitational waves.<br/>12. Unfortunately, the orbital lifetime of this binary system before merger is about 1.84 billion years.<br/>13. This is a substantial fraction of the age of the universe.Inspirals are very important sources of gravitational waves.<br/>14. Any time two compact objects (white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes) are in close orbits, they send out intense gravitational waves.<br/>15. As they spiral closer to each other, these waves become more intense.<br/>16. At some point they should become so intense that direct detection by their effect on objects on Earth or in space is possible.<br/>17. This direct detection is the goal of several large scale experiments.The only difficulty is that most systems like the Hulse-Taylor binary are so far away.<br/>18. The amplitude of waves given off by the Hulse-Taylor binary as seen on Earth would be roughly ""h"" ≈ 10−26.<br/>19. There are some sources, however, that astrophysicists expect to find with much larger amplitudes of ""h"" ≈ 10−20.<br/>20. At least eight other binary pulsars have been discovered.<br/>"
Chemical_reaction-Oxidation_and_reduction,11,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Chemical reaction<br/>Section: Oxidation and reduction<br/><br/>1. Redox reactions can be understood in terms of transfer of electrons from one involved species (reducing agent) to another (oxidizing agent).<br/>2. In this process, the former species is ""oxidized"" and the latter is ""reduced"".<br/>3. Though sufficient for many purposes, these descriptions are not precisely correct.<br/>4. Oxidation is better defined as an increase in oxidation state, and reduction as a decrease in oxidation state.<br/>5. In practice, the transfer of electrons will always change the oxidation state, but there are many reactions that are classed as ""redox"" even though no electron transfer occurs (such as those involving covalent bonds).In the following redox reaction, hazardous sodium metal reacts with toxic chlorine gas to form the ionic compound sodium chloride, or common table salt:<br/>6. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;formula_21<br/><br/>7. In the reaction, sodium metal goes from an oxidation state of 0 (as it is a pure element) to +1: in other words, the sodium lost one electron and is said to have been oxidized.</br>8. On the other hand, the chlorine gas goes from an oxidation of 0 (it is also a pure element) to -1: the chlorine gains one electron and is said to have been reduced.<br/>9. Because the chlorine is the one reduced, it is considered the electron acceptor, or in other words, induces oxidation in the sodium - thus the chlorine gas is considered the oxidizing agent.<br/>10. Conversely, the sodium is oxidized or is the electron donor, and thus induces reduction in the other species and is considered the ""reducing agent"".Which of the involved reactants would be reducing or oxidizing agent can be predicted from the electronegativity of their elements.<br/>11. <strike>Elements with low electronegativity, such as most metals, easily donate electrons and oxidize – they are reducing agents.</strike><br/>12. On the contrary, many ions with high oxidation numbers, such as , , , , can gain one or two extra electrons and are strong oxidizing agents.The number of electrons donated or accepted in a redox reaction can be predicted from the electron configuration of the reactant element.<br/>13. Elements try to reach the low-energy noble gas configuration, and therefore alkali metals and halogens will donate and accept one electron respectively.<br/>14. Noble gases themselves are chemically inactive.An important class of redox reactions are the electrochemical reactions, where electrons from the power supply are used as the reducing agent.<br/>15. These reactions are particularly important for the production of chemical elements, such as chlorine or aluminium.<br/>16. The reverse process in which electrons are released in redox reactions and can be used as electrical energy is possible and used in batteries.<br/>"

Biochemistry-Abstract,12,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Biochemistry<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. Biochemistry, sometimes called biological chemistry, is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms.<br/>2. By controlling information flow through biochemical signaling and the flow of chemical energy through metabolism, biochemical processes give rise to the complexity of life.<br/>3. Over the last 40 years, biochemistry has become so successful at explaining living processes that now almost all areas of the life sciences from botany to medicine are engaged in biochemical research.<br/>4. Today, the main focus of pure biochemistry is in understanding how biological molecules give rise to the processes that occur within living cells, which in turn relates greatly to the study and understanding of whole organisms.Biochemistry is closely related to molecular biology, the study of the molecular mechanisms by which genetic information encoded in DNA is able to result in the processes of life.<br/>5. Depending on the exact definition of the terms used, molecular biology can be thought of as a branch of biochemistry, or biochemistry as a tool with which to investigate and study molecular biology.Much of biochemistry deals with the structures, functions and interactions of biological macromolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and lipids, which provide the structure of cells and perform many of the functions associated with life.<br/>6. The chemistry of the cell also depends on the reactions of smaller molecules and ions.<br/>7. These can be inorganic, for example water and metal ions, or organic, for example the amino acids which are used to synthesize proteins.<br/>8. The mechanisms by which cells harness energy from their environment via chemical reactions are known as metabolism.<br/>9. The findings of biochemistry are applied primarily in medicine, nutrition, and agriculture.<br/>10. In medicine, biochemists investigate the causes and cures of disease.<br/>11. In nutrition, they study how to maintain health and study the effects of nutritional deficiencies.<br/>12. <strike>In agriculture, biochemists investigate soil and fertilizers, and try to discover ways to improve crop cultivation, crop storage and pest control.</strike><br/>"

Most organisms share element needs, but there are a few differences between plants and animals.<br/>4. For example ocean algae use bromine but land plants and animals seem to need none.<br/>5. All animals require sodium, but some plants do not.<br/>6. Plants need boron and silicon, but animals may not (or may need ultra-small amounts).Just six elements—carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, calcium, and phosphorus—make up almost 99% of the mass of a human body (see composition of the human body for a complete list).<br/>7.

Botany-Medicine_and_materials,8,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Botany<br/>Section: Medicine and materials<br/><br/>1. Phytochemistry is a branch of plant biochemistry primarily concerned with the chemical substances produced by plants during secondary metabolism.<br/>2. Some of these compounds are toxins such as the alkaloid coniine from hemlock.<br/>3. Others, such as the essential oils peppermint oil and lemon oil are useful for their aroma, as flavourings and spices (e.g., capsaicin), and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium poppies.<br/>4. Many medicinal and recreational drugs, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (active ingredient in cannabis), caffeine, morphine and nicotine come directly from plants.<br/>5. Others are simple derivatives of botanical natural products.<br/>6. For example, the pain killer aspirin is the acetyl ester of salicylic acid, originally isolated from the bark of willow trees, and a wide range of opiate painkillers like heroin are obtained by chemical modification of morphine obtained from the opium poppy.<br/>7. Popular stimulants come from plants, such as caffeine from coffee, tea and chocolate, and nicotine from tobacco.<br/>8. <strike>Most alcoholic beverages come from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plant products such as barley (beer), rice (sake) and grapes (wine).Plants can synthesise useful coloured dyes and pigments such as the anthocyanins responsible for the red colour of red wine, yellow weld and blue woad used together to produce Lincoln green, indoxyl, source of the blue dye indigo traditionally used to dye denim and the artist's pigments gamboge and rose madder.Sugar, starch, cotton, linen, hemp, some types of rope, wood and particle boards, papyrus and paper, vegetable oils, wax, and natural rubber are examples of commercially important materials made from plant tissues or their secondary products.</strike><br/>9. Charcoal, a pure form of carbon made by pyrolysis of wood, has a long history as a metal-smelting fuel, as a filter material and adsorbent and as an artist's material and is one of the three ingredients of gunpowder.<br/>10.

Products made from cellulose include rayon and cellophane, wallpaper paste, biobutanol and gun cotton.<br/>12. Sugarcane, rapeseed and soy are some of the plants with a highly fermentable sugar or oil content that are used as sources of biofuels, important alternatives to fossil fuels, such as biodiesel.<br/>"
Botany-Plant_hormones,8,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Botany<br/>Section: Plant hormones<br/><br/>1. Plants are not passive, but respond to external signals such as light, touch, and injury by moving or growing towards or away from the stimulus, as appropriate.<br/>2. Tangible evidence of touch sensitivity is the almost instantaneous collapse of leaflets of ""Mimosa pudica"", the insect traps of Venus flytrap and bladderworts, and the pollinia of orchids.The hypothesis that plant growth and development is coordinated by plant hormones or plant growth regulators first emerged in the late 19th century.<br/>3. Darwin experimented on the movements of plant shoots and roots towards light and gravity, and concluded ""It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radicle .<br/>4. .<br/>5. acts like the brain of one of the lower animals .<br/>6. .<br/>7. directing the several movements"".<br/>8. <strike>About the same time, the role of auxins (from the Greek auxein, to grow) in control of plant growth was first outlined by the Dutch scientist Frits Went.</strike><br/>9. The first known auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which promotes cell growth, was only isolated from plants about 50 years later.<br/>10. This compound mediates the tropic responses of shoots and roots towards light and gravity.<br/>11. The finding in 1939 that plant callus could be maintained in culture containing IAA, followed by the observation in 1947 that it could be induced to form roots and shoots by controlling the concentration of growth hormones were key steps in the development of plant biotechnology and genetic modification.Another class of phytohormones is the jasmonates, first isolated from the oil of ""Jasminum grandiflorum"" which regulates wound responses in plants by unblocking the expression of genes required in the systemic acquired resistance response to pathogen attack.In addition to being the primary energy source for plants, light functions as a signalling device, providing information to the plant, such as how much sunlight the plant receives each day.<br/>12. This can result in adaptive changes in a process known as photomorphogenesis.<br/>13. Phytochromes are the photoreceptors in a plant that are sensitive to light.<br/>"

For this reason, the nucleic acid sequence is also termed the primary structure.The sequence has capacity to represent information.<br/>5. Biological DNA represents the information which directs the functions of a living thing.<br/>6. In that context, the term genetic sequence is often used.<br/>7. Sequences can be read from the biological raw material through DNA sequencing methods.Nucleic acids also have a secondary structure and tertiary structure.<br/>8. Primary structure is sometimes mistakenly referred to as ""primary sequence"".<br/>9. Conversely, there is no parallel concept of secondary or tertiary sequence.<br/>"

Therefore, determining the sequence is useful in fundamental research into why and how organisms live, as well as in applied subjects.<br/>4. Because of the importance of DNA to living things, knowledge of a DNA sequence may be useful in practically any biological research.<br/>5. For example, in medicine it can be used to identify, diagnose and potentially develop treatments for genetic diseases.<br/>6. Similarly, research into pathogens may lead to treatments for contagious diseases.<br/>7. Biotechnology is a burgeoning discipline, with the potential for many useful products and services.RNA is not sequenced directly.<br/>8.

Magnetic_resonance_imaging-How_MRI_works,3,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Magnetic resonance imaging<br/>Section: How MRI works<br/><br/>1. To perform a study the patient is positioned within an MRI scanner which forms a strong magnetic field around the area to be imaged.<br/>2. Most medical applications rely on detecting a radio frequency signal emitted by excited hydrogen atoms in the body (present in any tissue containing water molecules) using energy from an oscillating magnetic field applied at the appropriate resonant frequency.<br/>3. <strike>The orientation of the image is controlled by varying the main magnetic field using gradient coils.</strike><br/>4. As these coils are rapidly switched on and off they create the characteristic repetitive noises of an MRI scan.<br/>5. The contrast between different tissues is determined by the rate at which excited atoms return to the equilibrium state.<br/>6. Exogenous contrast agents may be given intravenously, orally or intra-articularly.MRI requires a magnetic field that is both strong and uniform.<br/>7. The field strength of the magnet is measured in tesla – and while the majority of systems operate at 1.5T commercial systems are available between 0.2T–7T.<br/>8. Most clinical magnets are superconducting which requires liquid helium.<br/>9. The lower field strengths can be achieved with permanent magnets, which are often used in ""open"" MRI scanners for claustrophobic patients.<br/>"

The moving dipoles disturb the magnetic field but are often extremely rapid so that the average effect over a long time-scale may be zero.<br/>3. However, depending on the time-scale, the interactions between the dipoles do not always average away.<br/>4. At the slowest extreme the interaction time is effectively infinite and occurs where there are large, stationary field disturbances (e.g., a metallic implant).<br/>5. In this case the loss of coherence is described as a ""static dephasing"".<br/>6. T2* is a measure of the loss of coherence in an ensemble of spins that includes all interactions (including static dephasing).<br/>7. T2 is a measure of the loss of coherence that excludes static dephasing, using an RF pulse to reverse the slowest types of dipolar interaction.<br/>8. There is in fact a continuum of interaction time-scales in a given biological sample, and the properties of the refocusing RF pulse can be tuned to refocus more than just static dephasing.<br/>9. In general, the rate of decay of an ensemble of spins is a function of the interaction times and also the power of the RF pulse.<br/>10. This type of decay, occurring under the influence of RF, is known as T1ρ.<br/>11. It is similar to T2 decay but with some slower dipolar interactions refocused, as well as static interactions, hence T1ρ≥T2.<br/>"
Medicine-Specialties,"1, 2, 3","Category: Science<br/>Title: Medicine<br/>Section: Specialties<br/><br/>1. <strike>In the broadest meaning of ""medicine"", there are many different specialties.</strike><br/>2. <strike>In the UK, most specialities have their own body or college, which have its own entrance examination.</strike><br/>3. <strike>These are collectively known as the Royal Colleges, although not all currently use the term ""Royal"".</strike><br/>4. The development of a speciality is often driven by new technology (such as the development of effective anaesthetics) or ways of working (such as emergency departments); the new specialty leads to the formation a unifying body of doctors and the prestige of administering their own examination.Within medical circles, specialities usually fit into one of two broad categories: ""Medicine"" and ""Surgery.""<br/>5. ""Medicine"" refers to the practice of non-operative medicine, and most of its subspecialties require preliminary training in Internal Medicine.<br/>6.

At present, some specialties of medicine do not fit easily into either of these categories, such as radiology, pathology, or anesthesia.<br/>9. Most of these have branched from one or other of the two camps above; for example anaesthesia developed first as a faculty of the Royal College of Surgeons (for which MRCS/FRCS would have been required) before becoming the Royal College of Anaesthetists and membership of the college is attained by sitting the examination of the Fellowship of the Royal College of Anesthetists (FRCA).<br/>"

Radiation_therapy-Types,7,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Radiation therapy<br/>Section: Types<br/><br/>1. Historically, the three main divisions of radiation therapy are external beam radiation therapy (EBRT or XRT) or teletherapy, brachytherapy or sealed source radiation therapy, and systemic radioisotope therapy or unsealed source radiotherapy.<br/>2. The differences relate to the position of the radiation source; external is outside the body, brachytherapy uses sealed radioactive sources placed precisely in the area under treatment, and systemic radioisotopes are given by infusion or oral ingestion.<br/>3. Brachytherapy can use temporary or permanent placement of radioactive sources.<br/>4. The temporary sources are usually placed by a technique called afterloading.<br/>5.

"Radiation_therapy-Virtual_simulation,_3-dimensional_conformal_radiation_therapy,_and_intensity-modulated_radiation_therapy",10,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Radiation therapy<br/>Section: Virtual simulation, 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, and intensity-modulated radiation therapy<br/><br/>1. The planning of radiation therapy treatment has been revolutionized by the ability to delineate tumors and adjacent normal structures in three dimensions using specialized CT and/or MRI scanners and planning software.Virtual simulation, the most basic form of planning, allows more accurate placement of radiation beams than is possible using conventional X-rays, where soft-tissue structures are often difficult to assess and normal tissues difficult to protect.An enhancement of virtual simulation is 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT), in which the profile of each radiation beam is shaped to fit the profile of the target from a beam's eye view (BEV) using a multileaf collimator (MLC) and a variable number of beams.<br/>2. When the treatment volume conforms to the shape of the tumor, the relative toxicity of radiation to the surrounding normal tissues is reduced, allowing a higher dose of radiation to be delivered to the tumor than conventional techniques would allow.Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an advanced type of high-precision radiation that is the next generation of 3DCRT.<br/>3. IMRT also improves the ability to conform the treatment volume to concave tumor shapes, for example when the tumor is wrapped around a vulnerable structure such as the spinal cord or a major organ or blood vessel.<br/>4. Computer-controlled x-ray accelerators distribute precise radiation doses to malignant tumors or specific areas within the tumor.<br/>5. The pattern of radiation delivery is determined using highly tailored computing applications to perform optimization and treatment simulation (Treatment Planning).<br/>6. The radiation dose is consistent with the 3-D shape of the tumor by controlling, or modulating, the radiation beam’s intensity.<br/>7. The radiation dose intensity is elevated near the gross tumor volume while radiation among the neighboring normal tissue is decreased or avoided completely.<br/>8. The customized radiation dose is intended to maximize tumor dose while simultaneously protecting the surrounding normal tissue.<br/>9. This may result in better tumor targeting, lessened side effects, and improved treatment outcomes than even 3DCRT.3DCRT is still used extensively for many body sites but the use of IMRT is growing in more complicated body sites such as CNS, head and neck, prostate, breast and lung.<br/>10. <strike>Unfortunately, IMRT is limited by its need for additional time from experienced medical personnel.</strike><br/>11. This is because physicians must manually delineate the tumors one CT image at a time through the entire disease site which can take much longer than 3DCRT preparation.<br/>12. Then, medical physicists and dosimetrists must be engaged to create a viable treatment plan.<br/>13. Also, the IMRT technology has only been used commercially since the late 1990s even at the most advanced cancer centers, so radiation oncologists who did not learn it as part of their residency program must find additional sources of education before implementing IMRT.Proof of improved survival benefit from either of these two techniques over conventional radiation therapy (2DXRT) is growing for many tumor sites, but the ability to reduce toxicity is generally accepted.<br/>14. Both techniques enable dose escalation, potentially increasing usefulness.<br/>15. There has been some concern, particularly with IMRT, about increased exposure of normal tissue to radiation and the consequent potential for secondary malignancy.<br/>16. Overconfidence in the accuracy of imaging may increase the chance of missing lesions that are invisible on the planning scans (and therefore not included in the treatment plan) or that move between or during a treatment (for example, due to respiration or inadequate patient immobilization).<br/>17. New techniques are being developed to better control this uncertainty—for example, real-time imaging combined with real-time adjustment of the therapeutic beams.<br/>18. This new technology is called image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) or four-dimensional radiation therapy.Another technique is the real-time tracking and localization of one or more small implantable electric devices implanted inside or close to the tumor.<br/>19. There are various types of medical implantable devices that are used for this purpose.<br/>20. It can be a magnetic transponder which senses the magnetic field generated by several transmitting coils, and then transmits the measurements back to the positioning system to determine the location.<br/>21. The implantable device can also be a small wireless transmitter sending out an RF signal which then will be received by a sensor array and used for localization and real-time tracking of the tumor position.<br/>"

Weight gain can also be caused by some steroid medications.<br/>5. These side-effects can frequently be reduced or eliminated with antiemetic drugs.<br/>6. Self-care measures, such as eating frequent small meals and drinking clear liquids or ginger tea, are often recommended.<br/>7. In general, this is a temporary effect, and frequently resolves within a week of finishing treatment.<br/>8.

Targeted therapies are a relatively new class of cancer drugs that can overcome many of the issues seen with the use of cytotoxics.<br/>2.

They will kill any rapidly dividing cell, tumor or normal.<br/>5. Targeted therapies are designed to affect cellular proteins or processes that are utilised by the cancer cells.<br/>6. This allows a high dose to cancer tissues with a relatively low dose to other tissues.<br/>7. As different proteins are utilised by different cancer types, the targeted therapy drugs are used on a cancer type specific, or even on a patient specific basis.<br/>8. Although the side effects are often less severe than that seen of cytotoxic chemotherapeutics, life-threatening effects can occur.<br/>9. <strike>Initially, the targeted therapeutics were supposed to be solely selective for one protein.</strike><br/>10.

DNA uses the deoxynucleotides C, G, A, and T, while RNA uses the ribomucleotides (which have an extra hydroxyl(OH) group on the pentose ring) C, G, A, and U.<br/>5. Modified bases are fairly common (such as with methyl groups on the base ring), as found in ribosomal RNA or transfer RNAs or for discriminating the new from old strands of DNA after replication.Each nucleotide is made of an acyclic nitrogenous base, a pentose and one to three phosphate groups.<br/>6. They contain carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen and phosphorus.<br/>7. They serve as sources of chemical energy (adenosine triphosphate and guanosine triphosphate), participate in cellular signaling (cyclic guanosine monophosphate and cyclic adenosine monophosphate), and are incorporated into important cofactors of enzymatic reactions (coenzyme A, flavin adenine dinucleotide, flavin mononucleotide, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate).<br/>"
Biomolecule-Saccharides,12,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Biomolecule<br/>Section: Saccharides<br/><br/>1. Monosaccharides are the simplest form of carbohydrates with only one simple sugar.<br/>2. They essentially contain an aldehyde or ketone group in their structure.<br/>3. The presence of an aldehyde group in a monosaccharide is indicated by the prefix ""aldo-"".<br/>4. Similarly, a ketone group is denoted by the prefix ""keto-"".<br/>5. Examples of monosaccharides are the hexoses glucose, fructose, and galactose and pentoses, ribose, and deoxyribose Consumed fructose and glucose have different rates of gastric emptying, are differentially absorbed and have different metabolic fates, providing multiple opportunities for 2 different saccharides to differentially affect food intake.<br/>6. Most saccharides eventually provide fuel for cellular respiration.Disaccharides are formed when two monosaccharides, or two single simple sugars, form a bond with removal of water.<br/>7. They can be hydrolyzed to yield their saccharin building blocks by boiling with dilute acid or reacting them with appropriate enzymes.<br/>8. Examples of disaccharides include sucrose, maltose, and lactose.Polysaccharides are polymerized monosaccharides, or complex carbohydrates.<br/>9. They have multiple simple sugars.<br/>10. Examples are starch, cellulose, and glycogen.<br/>11. They are generally large and often have a complex branched connectivity.<br/>12. <strike>Because of their size, polysaccharides are not water-soluble, but their many hydroxy groups become hydrated individually when exposed to water, and some polysaccharides form thick colloidal dispersions when heated in water.</strike><br/>13. Shorter polysaccharides, with 3 - 10 monomers, are called oligosaccharides.A fluorescent indicator-displacement molecular imprinting sensor was developed for discriminating saccharides.<br/>14. It successfully discriminated three brands of orange juice beverage.<br/>15. The change in fluorescence intensity of the sensing films resulting is directly related to the saccharide concentration.<br/>"
Pathology-Abstract,3,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Pathology<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. Pathology is the precise study and diagnosis of disease.<br/>2. The word ""pathology"" is from Ancient Greek , ""pathos"" which may be translated into English as either ""experience"" or ""suffering"", and , ""-logia"", ""an account of"" or ""the study of"".<br/>3. <strike>""Pathologization"", to pathologize, refers to the process of defining a condition or behavior as pathological, e.g.</strike><br/>4. pathological gambling.<br/>5. Pathologies (or pathoses) is synonymous with diseases.<br/>6. The prefix ""path"" is used to indicate a state of disease, and may be used to indicate psychological (e.g.<br/>7. psychopath) or physical disease (e.g.<br/>8. cardiomyopathy).<br/>9. A physician practicing pathology is called a pathologist.Pathology addresses four components of disease: cause/etiology, mechanisms of development (pathogenesis), structural alterations of cells (morphologic changes), and the consequences of changes (clinical manifestations).Pathology is further separated into divisions, based on either the system being studied (e.g.<br/>10. dermatopathology) or the focus of the examination (e.g.<br/>11. forensic pathology and determining the cause of death).<br/>"
Pathology-Hematopathology,3,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Pathology<br/>Section: Hematopathology<br/><br/>1. Hematopathology is the study of diseases of blood cells (White blood cells, red blood cells, platelets) and cells/tissues/organs comprising the hematopoietic system.<br/>2. The term hematopoietic system refers to tissues and organs that produce and/or primarily host hematopoietic cells and include bone marrow, lymph node, thymus, spleen, and other lymphoid tissues.<br/>3. <strike>In the United States, hematopathology is a board certified subspecialty (American Board of Pathology) practiced by those physicians who have completed general pathology residency (anatomic, clinical, or combined) and an additional year of fellowship training in hematology.</strike><br/>4. The hematopathologist reviews biopsies of lymph nodes, bone marrows and other tissues involved by an infiltrate of cells of the hematopoietic system.<br/>5. In addition, the hematopathologist may be in charge of flow cytometric and/or molecular hematopathology studies.<br/>6. After the hematopathologist makes the diagnosis, the hematologist or hemato-oncologist can make a decision about the best course of action.<br/>"
International_Space_Station-Communications_and_computers,11,"Category: Science<br/>Title: International Space Station<br/>Section: Communications and computers<br/><br/>1. Radio communications provide telemetry and scientific data links between the station and Mission Control Centres.<br/>2. Radio links are also used during rendezvous and docking procedures and for audio and video communication between crewmembers, flight controllers and family members.<br/>3. As a result, the ISS is equipped with internal and external communication systems used for different purposes.The Russian Orbital Segment communicates directly with the ground via the ""Lira"" antenna mounted to ""Zvezda"".<br/>4. The ""Lira"" antenna also has the capability to use the ""Luch"" data relay satellite system.<br/>5. This system, used for communications with ""Mir"", fell into disrepair during the 1990s, and as a result is no longer in use, although two new ""Luch"" satellites—""Luch""-5A and ""Luch""-5B—were launched in 2011 and 2012 respectively to restore the operational capability of the system.<br/>6. Another Russian communications system is the Voskhod-M, which enables internal telephone communications between ""Zvezda"", ""Zarya"", ""Pirs"", ""Poisk"" and the USOS, and also provides a VHF radio link to ground control centres via antennas on ""Zvezda"" exterior.The US Orbital Segment (USOS) makes use of two separate radio links mounted in the Z1 truss structure: the S band (used for audio) and Ku band (used for audio, video and data) systems.<br/>7. These transmissions are routed via the United States Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) in geostationary orbit, which allows for almost continuous real-time communications with NASA's Mission Control Center (MCC-H) in Houston.<br/>8. Data channels for the Canadarm2, European ""Columbus"" laboratory and Japanese ""Kibō"" modules are routed via the S band and Ku band systems, although the European Data Relay Satellite System and a similar Japanese system will eventually complement the TDRSS in this role.<br/>9. Communications between modules are carried on an internal digital wireless network.UHF radio is used by astronauts and cosmonauts conducting EVAs.<br/>10. UHF is employed by other spacecraft that dock to or undock from the station, such as Soyuz, Progress, HTV, ATV and the Space Shuttle (except the shuttle also makes use of the S band and Ku band systems via TDRSS), to receive commands from Mission Control and ISS crewmembers.<br/>11. <strike>Automated spacecraft are fitted with their own communications equipment; the ATV uses a laser attached to the spacecraft and equipment attached to ""Zvezda"", known as the Proximity Communications Equipment, to accurately dock to the station.The ISS is equipped with approximately 100 IBM and Lenovo ThinkPad model A31 and T61P laptop computers.</strike><br/>12. Each computer is a commercial off-the-shelf purchase which is then modified for safety and operation including updates to connectors, cooling and power to accommodate the station's 28V DC power system and weightless environment.<br/>13. Heat generated by the laptops does not rise, but stagnates surrounding the laptop, so additional forced ventilation is required.<br/>14. Laptops aboard the ISS are connected to the station's wireless LAN via Wi-Fi and are connected to the ground at 3 Mbit/s up and 10 Mbit/s down, comparable to home DSL connection speeds.The operating system used for key station functions is the Debian version of Linux.<br/>15. The migration from Microsoft Windows was made in May 2013 for reasons of reliability, stability and flexibility.<br/>"
International_Space_Station-Stress,2,"Category: Science<br/>Title: International Space Station<br/>Section: Stress<br/><br/>1. There has been considerable evidence that psychosocial stressors are among the most important impediments to optimal crew morale and performance.<br/>2. <strike>Cosmonaut Valery Ryumin, wrote in his journal during a particularly difficult period onboard the Salyut 6 space station: “All the conditions necessary for murder are met if you shut two men in a cabin measuring 18 feet by 20 and leave them together for two months.”NASA's interest in psychological stress caused by space travel, initially studied when their manned missions began, was rekindled when astronauts joined cosmonauts on the Russian space station Mir.</strike><br/>3. Common sources of stress in early American missions included maintaining high performance while under public scrutiny, as well as isolation from peers and family.<br/>4. The latter is still often a cause of stress on the ISS, such as when the mother of NASA Astronaut Daniel Tani died in a car accident, and when Michael Fincke was forced to miss the birth of his second child.A study of the longest spaceflight concluded that the first three weeks represent a critical period where attention is adversely affected because of the demand to adjust to the extreme change of environment.<br/>5. While Skylab's 3 crews remained one, two, and three months respectively, long term crews on Salyut 6, Salyut 7, and the ISS last about five to six months while MIR's expeditions often lasted longer.<br/>6. The ISS working environment includes further stress caused by living and working in cramped conditions with people from very different cultures who speak a different language.<br/>7. First generation space stations had crews who spoke a single language, while second and third-generation stations have crew from many cultures who speak many languages.<br/>8. The ISS is unique because visitors are not classed automatically into 'host' or 'guest' categories as with previous stations and spacecraft, and may not suffer from feelings of isolation in the same way.<br/>9. Crew members with a military pilot background and those with an academic science background or teachers and politicians may have problems understanding each other's jargon and worldview.<br/>"
Proton-Description,1,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Proton<br/>Section: Description<br/><br/>1. <strike>Protons are spin-½ fermions and are composed of three valence quarks, making them baryons (a sub-type of hadrons).</strike><br/>2. The two up quarks and one down quark of the proton are held together by the strong force, mediated by gluons.<br/>3. A modern perspective has the proton composed of the valence quarks (up, up, down), the gluons, and transitory pairs of sea quarks.<br/>4. The proton has an approximately exponentially decaying positive charge distribution with a mean square radius of about 0.8 fm.Protons and neutrons are both nucleons, which may be bound together by the nuclear force to form atomic nuclei.<br/>5. The nucleus of the most common isotope of the hydrogen atom (with the chemical symbol ""H"") is a lone proton.<br/>6. The nuclei of the heavy hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium contain one proton bound to one and two neutrons, respectively.<br/>7. All other types of atomic nuclei are composed of two or more protons and various numbers of neutrons.<br/>"
Proton-History,18,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Proton<br/>Section: History<br/><br/>1. The concept of a hydrogen-like particle as a constituent of other atoms was developed over a long period.<br/>2. As early as 1815, William Prout proposed that all atoms are composed of hydrogen atoms (which he called ""protyles""), based on a simplistic interpretation of early values of atomic weights (see Prout's hypothesis), which was disproved when more accurate values were measured.In 1886, Eugen Goldstein discovered canal rays (also known as anode rays) and showed that they were positively charged particles (ions) produced from gases.<br/>3. However, since particles from different gases had different values of charge-to-mass ratio (e/m), they could not be identified with a single particle, unlike the negative electrons discovered by J. J. Thomson.Following the discovery of the atomic nucleus by Ernest Rutherford in 1911, Antonius van den Broek proposed that the place of each element in the periodic table (its atomic number) is equal to its nuclear charge.<br/>4. This was confirmed experimentally by Henry Moseley in 1913 using X-ray spectra.In 1917, (in experiments reported in 1919) Rutherford proved that the hydrogen nucleus is present in other nuclei, a result usually described as the discovery of the proton.<br/>5. Rutherford had earlier learned to produce hydrogen nuclei as a type of radiation produced as a product of the impact of alpha particles on hydrogen gas, and recognize them by their unique penetration signature in air and their appearance in scintillation detectors.<br/>6. These experiments were begun when Rutherford had noticed that, when alpha particles were shot into air (mostly nitrogen), his scintillation detectors showed the signatures of typical hydrogen nuclei as a product.<br/>7. After experimentation Rutherford traced the reaction to the nitrogen in air, and found that when alphas were produced into pure nitrogen gas, the effect was larger.<br/>8. Rutherford determined that this hydrogen could have come only from the nitrogen, and therefore nitrogen must contain hydrogen nuclei.<br/>9. One hydrogen nucleus was being knocked off by the impact of the alpha particle, producing oxygen-17 in the process.<br/>10. This was the first reported nuclear reaction, 14N + α → 17O + p. (This reaction would later be observed happening directly in a cloud chamber in 1925).Rutherford knew hydrogen to be the simplest and lightest element and was influenced by Prout's hypothesis that hydrogen was the building block of all elements.<br/>11. Discovery that the hydrogen nucleus is present in all other nuclei as an elementary particle, led Rutherford to give the hydrogen nucleus a special name as a particle, since he suspected that hydrogen, the lightest element, contained only one of these particles.<br/>12. He named this new fundamental building block of the nucleus the ""proton,"" after the neuter singular of the Greek word for ""first"", πρῶτον.<br/>13. However, Rutherford also had in mind the word ""protyle"" as used by Prout.<br/>14. Rutherford spoke at the British Association for the Advancement of Science at its Cardiff meeting beginning 24 August 1920.<br/>15. Rutherford was asked by Oliver Lodge for a new name for the positive hydrogen nucleus to avoid confusion with the neutral hydrogen atom.<br/>16. He initially suggested both ""proton"" and ""prouton"" (after Prout).<br/>17. Rutherford later reported that the meeting had accepted his suggestion that the hydrogen nucleus be named the ""proton"", following Prout's word ""protyle"".<br/>18. <strike>The first use of the word ""proton"" in the scientific literature appeared in 1920.</strike><br/>"
Electron-Particle_accelerators,4,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Electron<br/>Section: Particle accelerators<br/><br/>1. With the development of the particle accelerator during the first half of the twentieth century, physicists began to delve deeper into the properties of subatomic particles.<br/>2. The first successful attempt to accelerate electrons using electromagnetic induction was made in 1942 by Donald Kerst.<br/>3. His initial betatron reached energies of 2.3 MeV, while subsequent betatrons achieved 300 MeV.<br/>4. <strike>In 1947, synchrotron radiation was discovered with a 70 MeV electron synchrotron at General Electric.</strike><br/>5. This radiation was caused by the acceleration of electrons, moving near the speed of light, through a magnetic field.With a beam energy of 1.5 GeV, the first high-energyparticle collider was ADONE, which began operations in 1968.<br/>6. This device accelerated electrons and positrons in opposite directions, effectively doubling the energy of their collision when compared to striking a static target with an electron.<br/>7. The Large Electron–Positron Collider (LEP) at CERN, which was operational from 1989 to 2000, achieved collision energies of 209 GeV and made important measurements for the Standard Model of particle physics.<br/>"

The second and third generation contain charged leptons, the muon and the tau, which are identical to the electron in charge, spin and interactions, but are more massive.<br/>4. Leptons differ from the other basic constituent of matter, the quarks, by their lack of strong interaction.<br/>5. All members of the lepton group are fermions, because they all have half-odd integer spin; the electron has spin .<br/>"

In fact, according to traditional formulations of non-relativistic quantum mechanics, wave–particle duality applies to all objects, even macroscopic ones; although wave properties of macroscopic objects cannot be detected due to their small wavelengths.Interactions between particles have been scrutinized for many centuries, and a few simple laws underpin how particles behave in collisions and interactions.<br/>4. The most fundamental of these are the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum, which let us make calculations of particle interactions on scales of magnitude that range from stars to quarks.<br/>5. <strike>These are the prerequisite basics of Newtonian mechanics, a series of statements and equations in ""Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica"", originally published in 1687.</strike><br/>"
Quantum-Etymology_and_discovery,8,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Quantum<br/>Section: Etymology and discovery<br/><br/>1. The word ""quantum"" comes from the Latin ""quantus"", for ""how much"".<br/>2. ""Quanta"", short for ""quanta of electricity"" (electrons) was used in a 1902 article on the photoelectric effect by Philipp Lenard, who credited Hermann von Helmholtz for using the word in the area of electricity.<br/>3. However, the word quantum in general was well known before 1900.<br/>4. It was often used by physicians, such as in the term quantum satis.<br/>5. Both Helmholtz and Julius von Mayer were physicians as well as physicists.<br/>6. Helmholtz used ""quantum"" with reference to heat in his article on Mayer's work, and indeed, the word ""quantum"" can be found in the formulation of the first law of thermodynamics by Mayer in his letter dated July 24, 1841.<br/>7. Max Planck used ""quanta"" to mean ""quanta of matter and electricity"", gas, and heat.<br/>8. <strike>In 1905, in response to Planck's work and the experimental work of Lenard, who explained his results by using the term ""quanta of electricity"", Albert Einstein suggested that radiation existed in spatially localized packets which he called ""quanta of light"" (""Lightquanta"").The concept of quantization of radiation was discovered in 1900 by Max Planck, who had been trying to understand the emission of radiation from heated objects, known as black-body radiation.</strike><br/>9. By assuming that energy can only be absorbed or released in tiny, differential, discrete packets he called ""bundles"" or ""energy elements"", Planck accounted for the fact that certain objects change colour when heated.<br/>10. On December 14, 1900, Planck reported his revolutionary findings to the German Physical Society, and introduced the idea of quantization for the first time as a part of his research on black-body radiation.<br/>11. As a result of his experiments, Planck deduced the numerical value of ""h"", known as the Planck constant, and could also report a more precise value for the Avogadro–Loschmidt number, the number of real molecules in a mole and the unit of electrical charge, to the German Physical Society.<br/>12.

In developing countries, a variety of harvesting methods are in use, depending on the cost of labor, from combines to hand tools such as the scythe or cradle.If a crop is harvested during wet weather, the grain may not dry adequately in the field to prevent spoilage during its storage.<br/>5. In this case, the grain is sent to a dehydrating facility, where artificial heat dries it.In North America, farmers commonly deliver their newly harvested grain to a grain elevator, a large storage facility that consolidates the crops of many farmers.<br/>6.

These puddings are made either by simmering on top of the stove in a saucepan or double boiler or by baking in an oven, often in a bain-marie.<br/>3. <strike>These puddings are easily scorched on the fire, which is why a double boiler is often used; microwave ovens are also now often used to avoid this problem and to reduce stirring.Creamy puddings are typically served chilled, but a few, such as zabaglione and rice pudding, may be served warm.</strike><br/>4. Instant puddings do not require boiling and can therefore be prepared more quickly.<br/>5. This pudding terminology is common in North America and some European countries such as the Netherlands, whilst in Britain egg-thickened puddings are considered custards and starch-thickened puddings called blancmange.<br/>"
Seafood-Abstract,2,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Seafood<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. Seafood is any form of sea life regarded as food by humans.<br/>2. <strike>Seafood prominently includes fish and shellfish.Shellfish include various species of molluscs, crustaceans, and echinoderms.</strike><br/>3. Historically, sea mammals such as whales and dolphins have been consumed as food, though that happens to a lesser extent these days.<br/>4. Edible sea plants, such as some seaweeds and microalgae, are widely eaten as seafood around the world, especially in Asia (see the category of sea vegetables).<br/>5. In North America, although not generally in the United Kingdom, the term ""seafood"" is extended to fresh water organisms eaten by humans, so all edible aquatic life may be referred to as seafood.<br/>6. For the sake of completeness, this article includes all edible aquatic life.The harvesting of wild seafood is known as fishing and the cultivation and farming of seafood is known as aquaculture, mariculture, or in the case of fish, fish farming.<br/>7. Seafood is often distinguished from meat, although it is still animal and is excluded in a strict vegetarian diet.<br/>8. Seafood is an important source of protein in many diets around the world, especially in coastal areas.Most of the seafood harvest is consumed by humans, but a significant proportion is used as fish food to farm other fish or rear farm animal.<br/>9. Some seafoods (kelp) are used as food for other plants (fertilizer).<br/>10. In these ways, seafoods are indirectly used to produce further food for human consumption.<br/>11. Products, such as fish oil and spirulina tablets are also extracted from seafoods.<br/>12. Some seafood is feed to aquarium fish, or used to feed domestic pets, such as cats, and a small proportion is used in medicine, or is used industrially for non-food purposes (leather).<br/>"
Seafood-In_religion,2,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Seafood<br/>Section: In religion<br/><br/>1. For the most part Islamic dietary laws allow the eating of seafood, though the Hanbali forbid eels, the Shafi forbid frogs and crocodiles, and the Hanafi forbid bottom feeders such as shellfish and carp.<br/>2. <strike>The Jewish laws of Kashrut forbid the eating of shellfish and eels.</strike><br/>3. According to the King James version of the bible, it is alright to eat finfish, but shellfish and eels are an abomination and should not be eaten.<br/>4. Since early times, the Catholic church has forbidden the practice of eating meat, eggs and dairy products at certain times.<br/>5. Thomas Aquinas argued that these ""afford greater pleasure as food fish, and greater nourishment to the human body, so that from their consumption there results a greater surplus available for seminal matter, which when abundant becomes a great incentive to lust.""<br/>6. In the United States, the Catholic practice of abstaining from meat on Fridays has popularized the Friday fish fry, and parishes often sponsor a fish fry during Lent.<br/>7. In predominantly Roman Catholic areas, restaurants may adjust their menus during Lent by adding seafood items to the menu.<br/>"
Poutine-Recipe,12,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Poutine<br/>Section: Recipe<br/><br/>1. In the basic recipe for poutine, French fries are covered with fresh cheese curds, and topped with brown gravy.<br/>2. In a Quebec poutine:<br/>3. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Fries"": Usually of medium thickness, and fried (sometimes doubly) so that the inside stays soft, while the outside is crispy.<br/>4. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Cheese curds"": Fresh cheese curds are used to give the desired texture.<br/>5. The curd size may vary but is usually slightly smaller than bite-sized.<br/>6. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Gravy"": Traditionally a light and thin chicken, veal, or turkey gravy, mildly spiced with a hint of pepper, or a ""sauce brune"" which is a combination of beef and chicken stock, a variant originating in Quebec.<br/>7. The gravy should be thin enough to easily filter down into the mass of fries and cheese curds.<br/>8. These sauces typically also contain vinegar or a sour flavouring to balance the richness of the cheese and fries.<br/>9. Traditional poutine sauces (""mélange à sauce poutine"") are sold in Quebec, Ontario, and Maritime grocery stores in jars or cans and in powdered mix packets.<br/>10. Recently, some stores have begun to offer vegetarian gravy as an option to cater to ovolactovegetarians.<br/><br/>11. Heavy beef or pork-based brown gravies are rarely used.</br>12. <strike>To maintain the texture of the fries, the cheese curd and gravy are added immediately prior to serving the dish.</strike><br/>13. The hot gravy is usually poured over the cold cheese curds, so that the cheese is warmed without completely melting.<br/>14. It is important to control the temperature, timing and the order in which the ingredients are added, so as to obtain the right food textures which is an essential part of the experience of eating poutine.<br/>"
Poutine-Variations,12,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Poutine<br/>Section: Variations<br/><br/>1. There are many variations of poutine.<br/>2. Some restaurants offer poutine with such additions as chicken, bacon, or Montreal-style smoked meat.<br/>3. Some such restaurants even boast a dozen or more variations of poutine.<br/>4. For instance, more upscale poutine with three-pepper sauce, merguez sausage, foie gras or even caviar and truffle can be found.<br/>5. Some variations eliminate the cheese, but most Québécois would call such a dish a ""frite sauce"" (""french fries with sauce"") rather than poutine.<br/>6. Shawinigan and some other regions have ""patate-sauce-choux"" where shredded raw cabbage replaces cheese.<br/>7. Fast food combination meals in Canada often have the option of getting french fries ""poutinized"" by adding cheese curds (or shredded cheese in the Prairies and Western Canada) and gravy.Over the years, there have been many variations to this Classic Canadian Dish.<br/>8. Sweet potato, for example, has been invented to be a healthy alternative to french fries.<br/>9. The idea of adding dietary fiber and vitamins in this classic dish is widely appraised by the public.<br/>10. Outside Canada, poutine is found in northern border regions of the United States such as New England, the Pacific Northwest and the Upper Midwest.<br/>11. These regions offer further variations of the basic dish.<br/>12. <strike>Cheeses other than fresh curds are commonly used (most commonly mozzarella cheese), along with beef, brown or turkey gravy.</strike><br/>13. In the county culture especially, a mixed fry can also come with cooked ground beef on top and is referred to as a hamburger mix, though this is less popular than a regular mix.<br/>"
Marzipan-Iberian_Peninsula_line,5,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Marzipan<br/>Section: Iberian Peninsula line<br/><br/>1. Another possible geographic origin is in Spain, then known as Al-Andalus.<br/>2. In Toledo (850-900, though more probably 1150 during the reign of Alfonso VII) this specialty was known as ""Postre Regio"" instead of ""Mazapán"") and there are also mentions in The Book of One Thousand and One Nights of an almond paste eaten during Ramadan and as an aphrodisiac.Mazapán is Toledo's most famous dessert, often created for Christmas, and has PGI status.<br/>3. Almonds have to be at least 50% of the total weight, following the directives of ""Mazapán de Toledo"" regulator counseil.Another idea to support this line is the important tradition of another Spanish almond-based Christmas confectionery, the turron.Under EU law, marzipan must have a minimum almond oil content of 14% and a maximum moisture content of 8.5%.<br/>4. Optional additional ingredients are rosewater, honey, pistachios, preservatives, and sometimes hazelnut.<br/>5. <strike>In the U.S., marzipan is not officially defined, but it is generally made with a higher ratio of sugar to almonds than almond paste.</strike><br/>6. One brand, for instance, has 28% almonds in its marzipan, and 45% almonds in its almond paste.<br/>7. However, in Sweden and Finland almond paste refers to a marzipan that contains 50% ground almonds, a much higher quality than regular marzipan.<br/>8. In Germany, Lübecker Marzipan is known for its quality.<br/>9. It contains 66% almonds.<br/>10. The original manually produced Mozartkugeln are made from green pistachio marzipan.<br/>"
Marzipan-Etymology,9,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Marzipan<br/>Section: Etymology<br/><br/>1. The German name has largely ousted the original English name ""marchpane"" with the same apparent derivation: ""March bread.""<br/>2. (The word ""marchpane"" occurs in Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"", Act 1, Scene 5, Line 9.)<br/>3. ""Marzapane"" is documented earlier in Italian than in any other language, and the sense ""bread"" for ""pan"" is Romance.<br/>4. The origin could be from the Latin term ""martius panis"", which means ""bread of March"".<br/>5. However, the ultimate etymology is unclear; for example, the Italian word derives from the Latin words ""Massa"" (itself from Greek Μάζα ""Maza"") meaning pastry and ""Pan"" meaning bread, this can be particularly seen in the Provençal ""massapan"", the Portuguese ""maçapão"" (where 'ç' is an alternative form for the phoneme 'ss') and old Spanish ""mazapán"" - the change from 'ss' to 'z' in Latin words was common in old Spanish and the 'r' appeared later.<br/>6. Though, it could also be derived from martis pan, bread of March.<br/>7. Among the other possible etymologies set forth in the Oxford English Dictionary, one theory proposes that the word ""marzipan"" may be a corruption of Martaban, a Burmese city famous for its jars.The Real Academia Española suggests the idea of the Spanish word mazapán to be derived from the Hispanic Arabic بسمة pičmáṭ, which is derived from the Greek παξαμάδιον.Another source could be from Arabic موثابان ""mawthābān"" ""king who sits still.""<br/>8. The Arabic, Latinized as ""matapanus"", was used to describe a Venetian coin depicting an enthroned Christ the King.<br/>9. <strike>These coins were stored in ornate boxes.</strike><br/>10. From about the fifteenth century, when the coins were no longer in circulation, the boxes became decorative containers for storing and serving luxury sweetmeats.<br/>11. One such luxury that crept into the box in the sixteenth century is the now-famous almond-flavored marzipan, named (at least proximately) after the box in which it was stored.However, if marzipan has its origin in Persia, it is not unlikely that the name may come from Marzban (in Persian: مرزبان, derived from the words Marz مرز meaning ""border"" or ""boundary"" and the suffix -bān بان meaning guardian), a class of margraves or military commanders in charge of border provinces of the Sassanid Empire of Persia (Iran) between 3rd and 7th centuries CE.It is also a possibility that the origin of this dessert and the origin of the term come from different geographical places.<br/>"
Ketchup-Later_innovations,3,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Ketchup<br/>Section: Later innovations<br/><br/>1. In fast food outlets, ketchup is often dispensed in small packets.<br/>2. Diners tear the side or top and squeeze the ketchup out of the ketchup packets.<br/>3. <strike>In 2011, Heinz began offering a new measured-portion package, called the ""Dip and Squeeze"" packet, which allowed the consumer to either tear the top off the package and squeeze the contents out, as with the traditional packet, or, in the alternative, tear the ""front"" off the package and use the package as a dip cup of the type often supplied with certain entreés.Previously fast food outlets dispensed ketchup from pumps into paper cups.</strike><br/>4. This method has made a resurgence in the first decade of the 21st century with cost and environmental concerns increasing of individual packets.In October 2000, Heinz introduced colored ketchup products called EZ Squirt, which eventually included green, purple, pink, orange, teal, and blue.<br/>5. These products were made by adding food coloring to the traditional ketchup.<br/>6. these products have been discontinued.<br/>"
Ketchup-Terminology,4,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Ketchup<br/>Section: Terminology<br/><br/>1. The term used for the sauce varies.<br/>2. ""Ketchup"" (sometimes spelled ""catsup"" in American English, called ""a failed attempt at Anglicization"") is the dominant term in American English and Canadian English, with ""catsup"" being the prominent term in some southern US states.<br/>3. In these dialects, ""tomato sauce"" refers to pasta sauce, and is not a synonym for ketchup.<br/>4. <strike>""Tomato sauce"" is more common in Commonwealth English (e.g., Australia, India, New Zealand and South Africa).</strike><br/>5. In British English, the two terms are interchangeable.<br/>6. ""Red sauce"" is used in Welsh English, Scottish English, Irish English and some parts of England, such as the Black Country, and in South London, often contrasting with brown sauce with which it is often served but in Canadian and American English, ""red sauce"" refers to red spicy sauces (or sweet and sour sauce) and is not a synonym for ketchup.The etymology of the word ""ketchup"" is unclear, with multiple competing theories:<br/>"
"French_toast-""Pain_perdu""",1,"Category: Food<br/>Title: French toast<br/>Section: ""Pain perdu""<br/><br/>1. <strike>In France, Belgium, New Orleans, Acadiana and the Congo, French toast is called ""pain perdu"", which means ""lost bread"" in French.</strike><br/>2. It is called ""lost bread"" because it is a way to reclaim stale or ""lost"" bread.<br/>3. The hard bread is softened by dipping in a mixture of milk and eggs, and then fried.<br/>4. The bread is sliced on a bias and dipped into a mixture of egg, milk, sugar, cinnamon and vanilla.<br/>5. The slices are pan-fried in butter and traditionally dusted with powdered sugar and served with jam or syrup on the side.In New Orleans, ""pain perdu"" is a local variation of French toast and often shows up on menus as ""Lost Bread"".<br/>6. It is made from leftover New Orleans–style French bread.<br/>7. The bread resembles a French baguette, but has a crunchier exterior and a lighter interior and is usually fried in oil.<br/>8. It is eaten for breakfast in New Orleans.In France, ""pain perdu"" is considered to be a dessert, a breakfast as well as an afternoon tea snack (""goûter"").In Quebec, French toast is called ""pain doré"", which means ""golden bread"".<br/>"
Chicken_parmigiana-Abstract,3,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Chicken parmigiana<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. Chicken parmigiana (also referred to as a ""parmi"" or ""parma"") is a chicken dish based on the Italian Parmigiana, and is regularly served in Australian pubs.<br/>2. The meal consists of a breaded chicken breast, or chicken schnitzel, covered with a tomato-based neapolitan sauce and cheese.<br/>3. <strike>In Australia the addition of a slice of ham or bacon makes up the parmigiana.</strike><br/>4. The dish is typically served with a side of chips and salad, although there is some dispute as to whether the chips should be served under or next to the chicken.<br/>5. Size is considered to be a major part of the chicken parmigiana, and increased competition has led to a greater focus on the size of the meal.<br/>6. Some restaurants hold competitions with prizes for people who successfully finish a large chicken parmigiana, such as the ""Parmageddon"" which was held in an Adelaide Hills pub.The popularity of the chicken parmigiana led to a specialised chicken parmigiana restaurant opening in Melbourne, and the chicken parmigiana is the subject of reviews on dedicated websites which compare the dish as purchased from various pubs within a region.<br/>7. Other meals have also taken on the chicken parmigiana theme, including pies and Subway sandwiches.<br/>"

Maple_syrup-Grades,17,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Maple syrup<br/>Section: Grades<br/><br/>1. In Canada, maple syrup is classified by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) as one of three grades, each with several colour classes: Canada No.<br/>2. 1, including Extra Light, Light, and Medium; No.<br/>3. 2 Amber; and finally No.<br/>4. 3 Dark or any other ungraded category.<br/>5. Producers in Ontario or Québec may follow either federal or provincial grading guidelines.<br/>6. Québec's and Ontario's guidelines differ slightly from the federal: there are two ""number"" categories in Québec (Number 1, with four colour classes, and 2, with five colour classes).<br/>7. As in Québec, Ontario's producers have two ""number"" grades: 1, with three colour classes; and 2, with one colour class, which is typically referred to as ""Ontario Amber"" when produced and sold in that province only.<br/>8. A typical year's yield for a maple syrup producer will be about 25 to 30 percent of each of the #1 colours, 10 percent #2 Amber, and 2 percent #3 Dark.The United States uses different grading standards.<br/>9. Maple syrup is divided into two major grades: Grade A and Grade B. Grade A is further divided into three subgrades: Light Amber (sometimes known as Fancy), Medium Amber, and Dark Amber.<br/>10. The Vermont Agency of Agriculture Food and Markets uses a similar grading system of colour, and is roughly equivalent, especially for lighter syrups, but using letters: ""AA"", ""A"", etc.<br/>11. The Vermont grading system differs from the US system in maintaining a slightly higher standard of product density (measured on the Baumé scale).<br/>12. New Hampshire maintains a similar standard, but not a separate state grading scale.<br/>13. The Vermont-graded product has 0.9 percent more sugar and less water in its composition than US-graded.<br/>14. One grade of syrup not for table use, called commercial or Grade C, is also produced under the Vermont system.<br/>15. Vermont inspectors enforce strict syrup grading regulations, and can fine producers up to US$1000 for labeling syrup incorrectly.Extra Light and Grade A typically have a milder flavour than Grade B, which is very dark, with a rich maple flavour.<br/>16. The dark grades of syrup are used primarily for cooking and baking, although some specialty dark syrups are produced for table use.<br/>17. <strike>Syrup harvested earlier in the season tends to yield a lighter color.</strike><br/>18. The classification of maple syrup in the US depends ultimately on its translucence.<br/>19. US Grade A Light Amber has to be more than 75 percent translucent, US Grade A Medium Amber has to be 60.5 to 74.9 percent translucent, US Grade A Dark Amber has to be 44.0 to 60.4 percent translucent, and US Grade B is any product less than 44.0 percent translucent.The International Maple Syrup Institute has been working on international grading standards so that all producers will use the same grading system.<br/>20. Transition to the new system is expected in the coming years.<br/>"
Maple_syrup-Food_and_nutrition,10,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Maple syrup<br/>Section: Food and nutrition<br/><br/>1. The basic ingredient in maple syrup is the sap from the xylem of sugar maple or various other species of maple trees.<br/>2. It consists primarily of sucrose and water, with small amounts of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose from the invert sugar created in the boiling process.<br/>3. Organic acids, the most notable one being malic acid, make the syrup slightly acidic.<br/>4. Maple syrup has a relatively low mineral content, consisting largely of potassium and calcium, but also contains nutritionally significant amounts of zinc and manganese.<br/>5. Maple syrup also contains trace amounts of amino acids, which may contribute to the ""buddy"" flavour of syrup produced late in the season, as the amino acid content of sap increases at this time.<br/>6. Additionally, maple syrup contains a wide variety of volatile organic compounds, including vanillin, hydroxybutanone, and propionaldehyde.<br/>7. It is not yet known exactly what compounds are responsible for maple syrup's distinctive flavour, however its primary flavour contributing compounds are maple furanone, strawberry furanone, and maltol.Maple syrup is similar to sugar with respect to calorie content, but is a source of manganese, with 13 grams containing about 0.44 milligrams, or 22 percent of the US Food and Drug Administration Daily Value (DV%) of 2 milligrams.<br/>8. It is also a source of zinc with 13 grams containing 0.55 milligrams or 3.7 percent of the DV% of 15 milligrams.<br/>9. Compared to honey, maple syrup has 15 times more calcium and 1/10 as much sodium.Scientists have found that maple syrup's natural phenols – potentially beneficial antioxidant compounds – inhibit two carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes that are relevant to type 2 diabetes.<br/>10. <strike>In the study, 34 new compounds were discovered in pure maple syrup, five of which have never before been seen in nature.</strike><br/>11. Among the five new compounds is quebecol, a phenolic compound created when the maple sap is boiled to create syrup.British culinary expert Delia Smith described maple syrup as ""a unique ingredient, smooth- and silky-textured, with a sweet, distinctive flavour – hints of caramel with overtones of toffee will not do – and a rare colour, amber set alight.<br/>12. Maple flavour is, well, maple flavour, uniquely different from any other.""<br/>13. Agriculture Canada has developed a ""flavour wheel"" that details 91 unique flavours that can be present in maple syrup.<br/>14. These flavours are divided into 13 families: vanilla, empyreumatic (burnt), milky, fruity, floral, spicy, foreign deterioration or environment, maple, confectionery, plants forest-humus-cereals, herbaceous, or ligneous.<br/>15. These flavours are evaluated using a procedure similar to wine tasting.<br/>16. Other culinary experts praise its unique flavour.Maple syrup and its various artificial imitations are widely used as toppings for pancakes, waffles, and French toast in North America.<br/>17. They can also be used to flavour a variety of foods, including fritters, ice cream, hot cereal, fresh fruit, and sausages.<br/>18. It is also used as sweetener for granola, applesauce, baked beans, candied sweet potatoes, winter squash, cakes, pies, breads, tea, coffee, and hot toddies.<br/>19. Maple syrup can also be used as a replacement for honey in wine (mead).<br/>"
Pho-Etymology_and_origins,4,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Pho<br/>Section: Etymology and origins<br/><br/>1. Reviews of 19th and 20th century Indochinese literature have found that pho entered the mainstream sometime in the 1910s.<br/>2. Georges Dumoutier's extensive 1907 account of Vietnamese cuisine omits any mention of pho, while Nguyễn Công Hoan recalls its sale by street vendors in 1913.<br/>3. A 1931 dictionary is the first to define ' as a soup: ""from the word '.<br/>4. <strike>A dish consisting of small slices of rice cake boiled with beef.</strike><br/>5. ""Possibly the earliest English-language reference to pho was in the book ""Recipes of All Nations"", edited by Countess Morphy in 1935: In the book, pho is described as ""an Annamese soup held in high esteem ... made with beef, a veal bone, onions, a bayleaf, salt, and pepper, and a small teaspoon of ""nuoc-mam"""".<br/>6.

Around 1908–1909, the shipping industry brought an influx of laborers.<br/>5. Vietnamese and Chinese cooks set up ' to serve them ' but later switched to inexpensive scraps of beef set aside by butchers who sold to the French.<br/>6. Chinese vendors advertised this ' by crying out, ""Beef and noodles!""<br/>7. ().<br/>8. Eventually the street cry became ""Meat and noodles!""<br/>9. (), with the last syllable elongated.<br/>10. The French author Jean Marquet spells it ""!""<br/>11. in his 1919 novel ""Du village-à-la cité"".<br/>12.

Fajita-Abstract,1,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Fajita<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. <strike>A fajita (; ) is a term found in Tex-Mex cuisine, commonly referring to any grilled meat usually served as a taco on a flour or corn tortilla.</strike><br/>2. The term originally referred to the cut of beef used in the dish which is known as skirt steak.<br/>3. Popular meats today also include chicken, pork, shrimp, and all cuts of beef.<br/>4. In restaurants, the meat is often cooked with onions and bell peppers.<br/>5. Popular condiments are shredded lettuce, sour cream, guacamole, salsa, pico de gallo, cheese, and tomato.<br/>6.

Fajita-Popularity,2,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Fajita<br/>Section: Popularity<br/><br/>1. The first culinary evidence of the fajitas with the cut of meat, the cooking style (directly on a campfire or on a grill), and the Spanish nickname going back as far as the 1930s in the ranch lands of South and West Texas.<br/>2. <strike>During cattle roundups, beef were butchered regularly to feed the hands.</strike><br/>3. Throwaway items such as the hide, the head, the entrails, and meat trimmings such as skirt were given to the Mexican cowboys called vaqueros as part of their pay.<br/>4. Hearty border dishes like barbacoa de cabeza (head barbecue), menudo (tripe stew), and fajitas or arracheras (grilled skirt steak) have their roots in this practice.<br/>5. Considering the limited number of skirts per carcass and the fact the meat wasn't available commercially, the fajita tradition remained regional and relatively obscure for many years, probably only familiar to vaqueros, butchers, and their families.The food became popular in Tex-Mex restaurants in Houston, Austin, and San Antonio.<br/>6. In southern Arizona, the term was unknown except as a cut of meat until the 1990s, when Mexican fast food restaurants started using the word in their marketing.<br/>7. In recent years, fajitas have become popular at American casual dining restaurants as well as in home cooking.In many restaurants, the fajita meat is brought to the table sizzling loudly on a metal platter or skillet, with the tortillas and condiments.<br/>"
Lasagne-Abstract,4,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Lasagne<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. Lasagne ( or or , , singular lasagna) are a wide, flat pasta shape, and possibly one of the oldest types of pasta.<br/>2. The word also refers to a dish made with several layers of lasagne sheets alternated with sauces and various other ingredients.Lasagne originated in Italy, traditionally ascribed to the city of Bologna (Emilia-Romagna), in where the first modern receipe was created and published and became a traditional dish.<br/>3. Traditional lasagne is made by interleaving layers of pasta with layers of sauce, made with ragù, bechamel, and Parmigiano-Reggiano.<br/>4. <strike>In other regions and outside of Italy it is common to find lasagne made with ricotta or mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, various meats (e.g., ground beef, pork or chicken), miscellaneous vegetables (e.g., spinach, zucchini, mushrooms) and typically flavored with wine, garlic, onion, and oregano.</strike><br/>5. In all cases the lasagne are oven-baked.Traditionally, pasta dough prepared in Southern Italy used semolina and water and in the northern regions, where semolina was not available, flour and eggs.<br/>6. Today in Italy, since the only type of wheat allowed for commercially sold pasta is durum wheat, commercial lasagne are made of semolina (from durum wheat).Emilio-Romano’s intensive farming economy in the northern region of Italy results in plentiful dairy and meat products, and their commonality in regional cooking – more so than the olive oil found in southern regions of Italy.<br/>7. Pastas from Emilio-Romano and its capital, Bologna, are almost always served with a ragú, a thick sauce made from ingredients such as onions, carrots, finely chopped pork and beef, celery, butter, and tomatoes.<br/>"
Lasagne-Etymology,1,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Lasagne<br/>Section: Etymology<br/><br/>1. <strike>In the Ancient Rome, there was a dish similar to the lasagne called ""lasana"" or ""lasanum"" (Latin word for ""container"", ""pot"") described in the book ""L'arte culinaria"" by Marcus Gavius Apicius, but the word could have a more ancient origin.</strike><br/>2. The first theory is that ""lasagne"" comes from Greek λάγανον (""laganon""), a flat sheet of pasta dough cut into strips.<br/>3. The word λαγάνα (""lagana"") is still used in Greek to mean a flat thin type of unleavened bread.Another theory is that the word lasagne comes from the Greek λάσανα (""lasana"") or λάσανον (""lasanon"") meaning ""trivet or stand for a pot"", ""chamber pot"".<br/>4. The Romans borrowed the word as ""lasanum"", meaning ""cooking pot"" in Latin.<br/>5. The Italians used the word to refer to the dish in which lasagne is made.<br/>6. Later the name of the food took on the name of the serving dish.A third theory proposed that the dish is a development of the 14th century English recipe ""Loseyn"" as described in ""The Forme of Cury"", a cook book in use during the reign of Richard II.<br/>7. This has similarities to modern lasagne in both its recipe, which features a layering of ingredients between pasta sheets, and its name.<br/>8. An important difference is the lack of tomatoes, which did not arrive in Europe until after Columbus reached America in 1492.<br/>9. The earliest discussion of the tomato in European literature appeared in a herbal written in 1544 by Pietro Andrea Mattioli while the earliest discovered cookbook with tomato recipes was published in Naples in 1692, though the author had apparently obtained these recipes from Spanish sources.As with most other types of pasta, the word is a plural form, ""lasagne"" meaning more than one sheet of ""lasagna"".<br/>"
Chocolate_brownie-History,4,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Chocolate brownie<br/>Section: History<br/><br/>1. A chef at Chicago's Palmer House Hotel created the confection after Bertha Palmer requested a dessert for ladies attending the Chicago 1893 World Fair; it should be, she said, smaller than a piece of cake, though still retaining cake-like characteristics and easily eaten from boxed lunches.<br/>2. These first brownies featured an apricot glaze and walnuts, and they are still being made at the hotel according to the original recipe.The earliest published recipes for a brownie like those of today appeared in the ""Home Cookery"" (1904, Laconia, NH), ""Service Club Cook Book"" (1904, Chicago, IL), ""The Boston Globe"" (April 2, 1905 p. 34) and the 1906 edition of ""The Boston Cooking School Cook Book"" by Fannie Merritt Farmer.<br/>3. These recipes produced a relatively mild and cake-like brownie.<br/>4. <strike>The name ""brownie"" first appeared in the 1896 version of the cookbook, but this was in reference to molasses cakes baked individually in tin molds, not true brownies.A second recipe appeared in 1907 in ""Lowney’s Cook Book"", by Maria Willet Howard and published by the Walter M. Lowney Company of Boston, Massachusetts.</strike><br/>5.

Croissant-Abstract,1,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Croissant<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. <strike>A croissant ( or ; ) is a buttery flaky viennoiserie pastry named for its well known crescent shape.</strike><br/>2. Croissants and other viennoiserie are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough.<br/>3. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a sheet, in a technique called laminating.<br/>4. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.Crescent-shaped food breads have been made since the Middle Ages, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity.Croissants have long been a staple of French bakeries and pâtisseries.<br/>5. In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, pre-formed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food which can be freshly baked by unskilled labor.<br/>6. The croissanterie was explicitly a French response to American-style fast food, and today 30–40% of the croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries are frozen.<br/>7. Today, the croissant remains popular in a continental breakfast.<br/>"
Croissant-Origin,1,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Croissant<br/>Section: Origin<br/><br/>1. <strike>The Kipferl, ancestor of the croissant, has been documented in Austria going back at least as far as the 13th century, in various shapes.</strike><br/>2. The Kipferl can be made plain or with nut or other fillings (some consider the rugelach a form of Kipferl).The ""birth"" of the croissant itself – that is, its adaptation from the plainer form of Kipferl, before the invention of Viennoiserie – can be dated with some precision to at latest 1839 (some say 1838), when an Austrian artillery officer, August Zang, founded a Viennese bakery (""Boulangerie Viennoise"") at 92, rue de Richelieu in Paris.<br/>3. This bakery, which served Viennese specialities including the Kipferl and the Vienna loaf, quickly became popular and inspired French imitators (and the concept, if not the term, viennoiserie, a 20th-century term for supposedly Vienna-style pastries).<br/>4. The French version of the Kipferl was named for its crescent (""croissant"") shape and has become a identifiable shape across the world.Alan Davidson, editor of the ""Oxford Companion to Food"", found no printed recipe for the present-day croissant in any French recipe book before the early 20th century; the earliest French reference to a croissant he found was among the ""fantasy or luxury breads"" in Payen's ""Des substances alimentaires"", 1853.<br/>5. However, early recipes for non-laminated croissants can be found in the nineteenth century and at least one reference to croissants as an established French bread appeared as early as 1850.Zang himself returned to Austria in 1848 to become a press magnate, but the bakery remained popular for some time after, and was mentioned in several works of the time: ""This same M. Zank ...founded around 1830 , in Paris, the famous Boulangerie viennoise"".<br/>6. Several sources praise this bakery's products: ""Paris is of exquisite delicacy; and, in particular, the succulent products of the Boulangerie Viennoise""; ""which seemed to us as fine as if it came from the Viennese bakery on the rue de Richelieu"".By 1869, the croissant was well established enough to be mentioned as a breakfast staple, and in 1872, Charles Dickens wrote (in his periodical ""All the Year Round"") of: the workman's pain de ménage and the soldier's pain de munition, to the dainty croissant on the boudoir tableThe puff pastry technique which now characterizes the croissant was already mentioned in the late 17th century, when La Varenne's ""Le Cuisinier françois"" gave a recipe for it in the 1680 – and possibly earlier – editions.<br/>7. It was typically used, not on its own, but for shells holding other ingredients (as in a vol-au-vent).<br/>8.

There are at least two sorts, the ""pancake"" ""arepa"", which is made with baking powder, and the ""big flat"" ""arepa"", which is made without baking powder.<br/>6. These big flat ""arepas"" are, in size, not unlike the big tortillas one finds in Guanacaste (northern Costa Rica), (i.e.<br/>7. some twelve inches in diameter) and are made of white flour and are sugary.<br/>8. Once perfectly cooked, they should resemble a ""giraffe skin"", or a ""jaguar skin"" (i.e., white/yellowish with brown spots).In Mexico, Gorditas are a similar fried dish, but are different from tortillas.In Puerto Rico, ""arepas"" are made with maize meal, coconut milk, lard, butter, flour, and baking powder.<br/>9.

If cooked properly, dry rendang can last for as long as four weeks.Traditional Padang rendang takes hours to cook.<br/>7. Cooking rendang involves pounding and grinding ingredients as well as slow cooking, and so is time-consuming and requires patience.<br/>8. The meat pieces are slowly cooked in coconut milk and spices until almost all the liquid is gone, allowing the meat to absorb the condiments.<br/>9. The cooking process changes from boiling to frying as the liquid evaporates.<br/>10. The slow cooking process allows the meat to absorb all the spices and to become tender.<br/>11. To cook the meat until tender, with almost all liquids evaporated, requires great care, if the meat is not to burn or be spoiled.<br/>12. Because of its generous use of numerous spices, rendang is known for having a complex and unique taste.Rendang is often served with steamed rice, ""ketupat"" (a compressed rice cake), or ""lemang"" (glutinous rice barbecued in bamboo tubes), accompanied with vegetable side dishes such as boiled cassava leaf, ""cubadak"" (young jackfruit gulai), cabbage gulai, and ""lado"" (red or green chilli pepper sambal).<br/>"
