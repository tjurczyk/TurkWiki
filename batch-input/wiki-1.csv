Andy_Warhol-1960s,"Category: Art<br/>Title: Andy Warhol<br/>Section: 1960s<br/><br/>1. He began exhibiting his work during the 1950s.<br/>2. He held exhibitions at the Hugo Gallery, and the Bodley Gallery in New York City and in California his first West Coast gallery exhibition was on July 9, 1962, in the Ferus Gallery of Los Angeles.<br/>3. The exhibition marked his West Coast debut of pop art.Andy Warhol's first New York solo pop art exhibition was hosted at Eleanor Ward's Stable Gallery November 6–24, 1962.<br/>4. The exhibit included the works ""Marilyn Diptych"", ""100 Soup Cans"", ""100 Coke Bottles,"" and ""100 Dollar Bills"".<br/>5. At the Stable Gallery exhibit, the artist met for the first time poet John Giorno who would star in Warhol's first film, ""Sleep"", in 1963.It was during the 1960s that Warhol began to make paintings of iconic American objects such as dollar bills, mushroom clouds, electric chairs, Campbell's Soup Cans, Coca-Cola bottles, celebrities such as Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, Marlon Brando, Troy Donahue, Muhammad Ali, and Elizabeth Taylor, as well as newspaper headlines or photographs of police dogs attacking civil rights protesters.<br/>6. During these years, he founded his studio, ""The Factory"" and gathered about him a wide range of artists, writers, musicians, and underground celebrities.<br/>7. His work became popular and controversial.<br/>8. Warhol had this to say about Coca Cola:New York's Museum of Modern Art hosted a Symposium on pop art in December 1962 during which artists like Warhol were attacked for ""capitulating"" to consumerism.<br/>9. Critics were scandalized by Warhol's open embrace of market culture.<br/>10. This symposium set the tone for Warhol's reception.<br/>11. Throughout the decade it became increasingly clear that there had been a profound change in the culture of the art world, and that Warhol was at the center of that shift.A pivotal event was the 1964 exhibit ""The American Supermarket"", a show held in Paul Bianchini's Upper East Side gallery.<br/>12. The show was presented as a typical U.S. small supermarket environment, except that everything in it—from the produce, canned goods, meat, posters on the wall, etc.—was created by six prominent pop artists of the time, among them the controversial (and like-minded) Billy Apple, Mary Inman, and Robert Watts.<br/>13. Warhol's painting of a can of Campbell's soup cost $1,500 while each autographed can sold for $6.<br/>14. The exhibit was one of the first mass events that directly confronted the general public with both pop art and the perennial question of what art is.As an advertisement illustrator in the 1950s, Warhol used assistants to increase his productivity.<br/>15. Collaboration would remain a defining (and controversial) aspect of his working methods throughout his career; this was particularly true in the 1960s.<br/>16. One of the most important collaborators during this period was Gerard Malanga.<br/>17. Malanga assisted the artist with the production of silkscreens, films, sculpture, and other works at ""The Factory,"" Warhol's aluminum foil-and-silver-paint-lined studio on 47th Street (later moved to Broadway).<br/>18. Other members of Warhol's Factory crowd included Freddie Herko, Ondine, Ronald Tavel, Mary Woronov, Billy Name, and Brigid Berlin (from whom he apparently got the idea to tape-record his phone conversations).During the 1960s, Warhol also groomed a retinue of bohemian and counterculture eccentrics upon whom he bestowed the designation ""Superstars"", including Nico, Joe Dallesandro, Edie Sedgwick, Viva, Ultra Violet, Holly Woodlawn, Jackie Curtis, and Candy Darling.<br/>19. These people all participated in the Factory films, and some—like Berlin—remained friends with Warhol until his death.<br/>20. Important figures in the New York underground art/cinema world, such as writer John Giorno and film-maker Jack Smith, also appear in Warhol films of the 1960s, revealing Warhol's connections to a diverse range of artistic scenes during this time.<br/>"

Protestant_Reformation-Polish_–_Lithuanian_Commonwealth,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Protestant Reformation<br/>Section: Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth<br/><br/>1. In the first half of the 16th century, the enormous Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was a country of many creeds, but Roman Catholic Church remained the dominating religion.<br/>2. Reformation reached Poland in the 1520s, and quickly gained popularity among mostly German-speaking inhabitants of such major cities, as Gdańsk, Toruń and Elbląg.<br/>3. In Koenigsberg, in 1530, Polish-language edition of Luther's Small Catechism was published.<br/>4. The Duchy of Prussia, which was a Polish fief, emerged as key center of the movement, with numerous publishing houses issuing not only Bibles, but also catechisms, in German, Polish and Lithuanian.Lutheranism gained popularity in northern part of the country, while Calvinism caught the interest of szlachta, mainly in Lesser Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.<br/>5. Several publishing houses were opened in Lesser Poland in mid-16th century, in such locations, as Słomniki and Raków.<br/>6. At that time, Mennonites and Czech Brothers came to Poland, with the latter ones settling mostly in Greater Poland, around Leszno.<br/>7. In 1565, Polish Brethren appeared as yet another reformation movement.The 16th century Commonwealth was unique in Europe, because of widespread tolerance, confirmed by the Warsaw Confederation.<br/>8. In 1563, the Brest Bible was published (see also Bible translations into Polish).<br/>9. The period of tolerance ended during the reign of King Sigismund III Vasa, who was under strong influence of Piotr Skarga and other Jesuits.<br/>10. After the Deluge, and other wars of the mid-17th century, in which all enemies of Poland were either Protestant or Orthodox Christians, the attitude of Poles changed.<br/>11. Counter-Reformation prevailed, in 1658 Polish Brethren were forced to leave the country, and in 1666, the Sejm banned apostasy from Catholicism to any other religion, under punishment of death.<br/>12. Finally, in 1717, the Silent Sejm banned non-Catholics from becoming deputies of the Parliament.Among most important Protestants of the Commonwealth, there are such names, as Mikołaj Rej, Marcin Czechowic, Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski and Symon Budny.<br/>"
Brazil-Culture,"Category: Country<br/>Title: Brazil<br/>Section: Culture<br/><br/>1. The core culture of Brazil is derived from Portuguese culture, because of its strong colonial ties with the Portuguese empire.<br/>2. Among other influences, the Portuguese introduced the Portuguese language, Roman Catholicism and colonial architectural styles.<br/>3. The culture was, however, also strongly influenced by African, indigenous and non-Portuguese European cultures and traditions.Some aspects of Brazilian culture were influenced by the contributions of Italian, German and other European as well Japanese, Jewish and Arab immigrants who arrived in large numbers in the South and Southeast of Brazil.<br/>4. The indigenous Amerindians influenced Brazil's language and cuisine; and the Africans influenced language, cuisine, music, dance and religion.Brazilian art has developed since the 16th century into different styles that range from Baroque (the dominant style in Brazil until the early 19th century) to Romanticism, Modernism, Expressionism, Cubism, Surrealism and Abstractionism.<br/>5. Brazilian cinema dates back to the birth of the medium in the late 19th century and has gained a new level of international acclaim since the 1960s.<br/>"
Vincent_van_Gogh-Portraits,"Category: Art<br/>Title: Vincent van Gogh<br/>Section: Portraits<br/><br/>1. Although Van Gogh is best known for his landscapes, he seemed to find painting portraits his greatest ambition.<br/>2. He said of portrait studies, ""The only thing in painting that excites me to the depths of my soul, and which makes me feel the infinite more than anything else.<br/>3. ""To his sister he wrote, ""I should like to paint portraits which appear after a century to people living then as apparitions.<br/>4. By which I mean that I do not endeavor to achieve this through photographic resemblance, but my means of our impassioned emotions – that is to say using our knowledge and our modern taste for color as a means of arriving at the expression and the intensification of the character.<br/>5. ""Of painting portraits, Van Gogh wrote: ""in a picture I want to say something comforting as music is comforting.<br/>6. I want to paint men and women with that something of the eternal which the halo used to symbolize, and which we seek to communicate by the actual radiance and vibration of our coloring.""<br/>"
India-Motion_pictures,"Category: Country<br/>Title: India<br/>Section: Motion pictures<br/><br/>1. The Indian film industry produces the world's most-watched cinema.<br/>2. Established regional cinematic traditions exist in the Assamese, Bengali, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Oriya, Tamil, and Telugu languages.<br/>3. South Indian cinema attracts more than 75% of national film revenue.<br/>4. Television broadcasting began in India in 1959 as a state-run medium of communication, and had slow expansion for more than two decades.<br/>5. The state monopoly on television broadcast ended in the 1990s and, since then, satellite channels have increasingly shaped popular culture of Indian society.<br/>6. Today, television is the most penetrative media in India; industry estimates indicate that as of 2012 there are over 554 million TV consumers, 462 million with satellite and/or cable connections, compared to other forms of mass media such as press (350 million), radio (156 million) or internet (37 million).<br/>"
Salvador_Dalí-Final_years,"Category: Art<br/>Title: Salvador Dalí<br/>Section: Final years<br/><br/>1. In 1980 at age 76, Dalí's health took a catastrophic turn.<br/>2. His right hand trembled terribly, with Parkinson-like symptoms.<br/>3. His near-senile wife, Gala Dalí, allegedly had been dosing him with a dangerous cocktail of unprescribed medicine that damaged his nervous system, thus causing an untimely end to his artistic capacity.<br/>4. In 1982, King Juan Carlos bestowed on Dalí the title of ""Marqués de Dalí de Púbol"" (""Marquis of Dalí de Púbol"") in the nobility of Spain, hereby referring to Púbol, the place where he lived.<br/>5. The title was in first instance hereditary, but on request of Dalí changed to life only in 1983.<br/>6. To show his gratitude for this, Dalí later gave the king a drawing (""Head of Europa"", which would turn out to be Dalí's final drawing) after the king visited him on his deathbed.Gala died on June 10, 1982, at the age of 87.<br/>7. After Gala's death, Dalí lost much of his will to live.<br/>8. He deliberately dehydrated himself, possibly as a suicide attempt, with claims stating he had tried to put himself into a state of suspended animation as he had read that some microorganisms could do.<br/>9. He moved from Figueres to the castle in Púbol, which he had bought for Gala and had been the site of her death.<br/>10. In 1984, a fire broke out in his bedroom under unclear circumstances.<br/>11. It was possibly a suicide attempt by Dalí, or possibly simple negligence by his staff.<br/>12. Dalí was rescued by friend and collaborator Robert Descharnes and returned to Figueres, where a group of his friends, patrons, and fellow artists saw to it that he was comfortable living in his Theater-Museum in his final years.There have been allegations that Dalí was forced by his guardians to sign blank canvases that would later, even after his death, be used in forgeries and sold as originals.<br/>13. As a result, art dealers tend to be wary of late works attributed to Dalí.In November 1988, Dalí entered the hospital with heart failure; a pacemaker had already been implanted previously.<br/>14. On December 5, 1988, he was visited by King Juan Carlos, who confessed that he had always been a serious devotee of Dalí.On January 23, 1989, while his favorite record of ""Tristan and Isolde"" played, he died of heart failure at Figueres at the age of 84.<br/>15. He is buried in the crypt of his Teatro Museo in Figueres.<br/>16. The location is across the street from the church of ""Sant Pere"", where he had his baptism, first communion, and funeral, and is only three blocks from the house where he was born.The Gala-Salvador Dalí Foundation currently serves as his official estate.<br/>17. The US copyright representative for the Gala-Salvador Dalí Foundation is the Artists Rights Society.<br/>18. In 2002, the Society made the news when they asked Google to remove a customized version of its logo put up to commemorate Dalí, alleging that portions of specific artworks under their protection had been used without permission.<br/>19. Google complied with the request, but denied that there was any copyright violation.<br/>"
Treaty_of_Versailles-United_States,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Treaty of Versailles<br/>Section: United States<br/><br/>1. After the Versailles conference Wilson claimed that ""at last the world knows America as the savior of the world!<br/>2. ""The Republican Party—led by Henry Cabot Lodge—controlled the U.S. Senate after the election of 1918, but the Senators were divided into multiple positions on the Versailles question.<br/>3. It proved possible to build a majority coalition, but impossible to build a two-thirds coalition that was needed to pass a treaty.An angry bloc of 12–18 ""Irreconcilables"", mostly Republicans but also representatives of the Irish and German Democrats, fiercely opposed the Treaty.<br/>4. One block of Democrats strongly supported the Versailles Treaty, even with reservations added by Lodge.<br/>5. A second group of Democrats supported the Treaty but followed Wilson in opposing any amendments or reservations.<br/>6. The largest bloc—led by Senator Lodge— comprised a majority of the Republicans.<br/>7. They wanted a treaty with reservations, especially on Article X, which involved the power of the League of Nations to make war without a vote by the U.S. Congress.<br/>8. All of the Irreconcilables were bitter enemies of President Wilson, and he launched a nationwide speaking tour in the summer of 1919 to refute them.<br/>9. However, Wilson collapsed midway with a serious stroke that effectively ruined his leadership skills.The closest the Treaty came to passage was on November 19, 1919, as Lodge and his Republicans formed a coalition with the pro-Treaty Democrats, and were close to a two-thirds majority for a Treaty with reservations, but Wilson rejected this compromise and enough Democrats followed his lead to permanently end the chances for ratification.Among the American public as a whole, the Irish Catholics and the German Americans were intensely opposed to the Treaty, saying it favored the British.After Wilson's successor Warren G. Harding continued American opposition to the League of Nations, Congress passed the Knox–Porter Resolution bringing a formal end to hostilities between the U.S. and the Central Powers.<br/>10. It was signed into law by Harding on July 21, 1921.The U.S.–German Peace Treaty of 1921 was signed in Berlin on , the US–Austrian Peace Treaty of 1921 was signed in Vienna on , and the US–Hungarian Peace Treaty of 1921 was signed in Budapest on .<br/>"
Toy_Story-Editing_and_pre-release,"Category: Movies<br/>Title: Toy Story<br/>Section: Editing and pre-release<br/><br/>1. It was difficult for crew members to perceive the film's quality during much of the production process, when the finished footage was in scattered pieces and lacked elements like music and sound design.<br/>2. Some animators felt the film would be a significant disappointment commercially, but felt animators and animation fans would find it interesting.<br/>3. According to Lee Unkrich, one of the original editors of ""Toy Story"", a scene was cut out of the original final edit.<br/>4. The scene features Sid, after Pizza Planet, torturing Buzz and Woody violently.<br/>5. Unkrich decided to cut right into the scene where Sid is interrogating the toys because the creators of the movie thought the audience would be loving Buzz and Woody at that point.<br/>6. Another scene, where Woody was trying to get Buzz's attention when he was stuck in the box crate, was shortened because the creators felt it would lose the energy of the movie.<br/>7. Peter Schneider had grown buoyant about the film as it neared completion, and announced a United States release date of November, coinciding with Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the winter holiday season.Sources indicate that executive producer Steve Jobs lacked confidence in the film during its production, and he had been talking to various companies, ranging from Hallmark to Microsoft, about selling Pixar.<br/>8. However, as the film progressed, Jobs became ever more excited about it, feeling that he might be on the verge of transforming the movie industry.<br/>9. As scenes from the movie were finished, he watched them repeatedly and had friends come by his home to share his new passion.<br/>10. Jobs decided that the release of ""Toy Story"" that November would be the occasion to take Pixar public.<br/>11. A test audience near Anaheim in late July 1995 indicated the need for last-minute tweaks, which added further pressure to the already frenetic final weeks.<br/>12. Response cards from the audience were encouraging, but were not top of the scale, adding further question as to how audiences would respond.<br/>13. The film ended with a shot of Andy's house and the sound of a new puppy.<br/>14. Michael Eisner, who attended the screening, told Lasseter afterward that the film needed to end with a shot of Woody and Buzz together, reacting to the news of the puppy.<br/>"
Doctor_Who-Episodes,"Category: Tv<br/>Title: Doctor Who<br/>Section: Episodes<br/><br/>1. <br/>2. ""Doctor Who"" originally ran for 26 seasons on BBC One, from 23 November 1963 until 6 December 1989.<br/>3. During the original run, each weekly episode formed part of a story (or ""serial"") — usually of four to six parts in earlier years and three to four in later years.<br/>4. Notable exceptions were: ""The Daleks' Master Plan"", which aired in 12 episodes (plus an earlier one-episode teaser, ""Mission to the Unknown"", featuring none of the regular cast); almost an entire season of seven-episode serials (season 7); the 10-episode serial ""The War Games""; and ""The Trial of a Time Lord"", which ran for 14 episodes (albeit divided into three production codes and four narrative segments) during season 23.<br/>5. Occasionally serials were loosely connected by a storyline, such as season 8 being devoted to the Doctor battling a rogue Time Lord called The Master, season 16's quest for The Key to Time, season 18's journey through E-Space and the theme of entropy, and season 20's Black Guardian Trilogy.The programme was intended to be educational and for family viewing on the early Saturday evening schedule.<br/>6. Initially, it alternated stories set in the past, which were intended to teach younger audience members about history, with stories set either in the future or in outer space to teach them about science.<br/>7. This was also reflected in the Doctor's original companions, one of whom was a science teacher and another a history teacher.However, science fiction stories came to dominate the programme and the ""historicals"", which were not popular with the production team, were dropped after ""The Highlanders"" (1967).<br/>8. While the show continued to use historical settings, they were generally used as a backdrop for science fiction tales, with one exception: ""Black Orchid"" set in 1920s England.The early stories were serial-like in nature, with the narrative of one story flowing into the next, and each episode having its own title, although produced as distinct stories with their own production codes.<br/>9. Following ""The Gunfighters"" (1966), however, each serial was given its own title, with the individual parts simply being assigned episode numbers.Of the programme's many writers, Robert Holmes was the most prolific, while Douglas Adams became the most well-known outside ""Doctor Who"" itself, due to the popularity of his ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"".The serial format changed for the 2005 revival, with each series usually consisting of 13 45-minute, self-contained episodes (60 minutes with adverts, on overseas commercial channels), and an extended episode broadcast on Christmas Day.<br/>10. Each series includes several standalone and multi-part stories, linked with a loose story arc that resolves in the series finale.<br/>11. As in the early ""classic"" era, each episode, whether standalone or part of a larger story, has its own title.<br/>12. Occasionally, regular-series episodes will exceed the 45-minute run time; notably, the episodes ""Journey's End"" from 2008 and ""The Eleventh Hour"" from 2010 exceeded an hour in length.800 ""Doctor Who"" instalments have been televised since 1963, ranging between 25-minute episodes (the most common format), 45-minute episodes (for ""Resurrection of the Daleks"" in the 1984 series, a single season in 1985, and the revival), two feature-length productions (1983's ""The Five Doctors"" and the 1996 television film), eight Christmas specials (most of 60 minutes' duration, one of 72 minutes), and four additional specials ranging from 60 to 75 minutes in 2009, 2010 and 2013.<br/>13. Four mini-episodes, running about eight minutes each, were also produced for the 1993, 2005 and 2007 Children in Need charity appeals, while another mini-episode was produced in 2008 for a ""Doctor Who""-themed edition of The Proms.<br/>14. The 1993 2-part story, entitled ""Dimensions in Time"", was made in collaboration with the cast of the BBC soap-opera ""EastEnders"" and was filmed partly on the ""EastEnders"" set.<br/>15. A two-part mini-episode was also produced for the 2011 edition of Comic Relief.<br/>16. Starting with the 2009 special ""Planet of the Dead"", the series was filmed in 1080i for HDTV, and broadcast simultaneously on BBC One and BBC HD.To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the show, a special 3D episode, ""The Day of the Doctor"", was broadcast in 2013.<br/>17. In March 2013, it was announced that Tennant and Piper would be returning, and that the episode would have a limited cinematic release worldwide.<br/>"

Spain-Property_boom_and_bust,"Category: Country<br/>Title: Spain<br/>Section: Property boom and bust<br/><br/>1. The adoption of the Euro saw a marked reduction in interest rates to historic lows.<br/>2. The growth in the Spanish property market, which had begun in 1997, accelerated and within a few years had developed into a property bubble, financed largely by the cajas (regional savings banks under the oversight of the regional governments) and fed by the historically low interest rates and a massive growth of immigration.<br/>3. The Spanish economy was credited for having avoided the virtual zero growth rate of some of its largest partners in the EU.<br/>4. The country's economy created more than half of all the new jobs in the European Union over the five years ending 2005.<br/>5. The bubble imploded in 2008, causing the collapse of Spain's large property related and construction sectors, causing mass layoffs, and a collapsing domestic demand for goods and services.<br/>6. By the end of May 2009, unemployment reached 18.7% (37% for youths).At first, Spain's banks and financial services avoided the early crisis of their counterparts in the US and UK.<br/>7. This was particularly the case with Spain's international banks, Banco Santander and BBVA, that had diversified, international portfolios and had actively limited their exposure to housing mortgage risk.<br/>8. Banco Santander was able to profit from the global financial crisis by taking over distressed British banking firms.<br/>9. However, as the recession deepened and property prices slid, the growing bad debts of the smaller regional savings banks, the cajas, forced the intervention of Spain's central bank and government through a stabilisation and consolidation program, taking over or consolidating regional cajas and finally receiving a bank bailout from the European Central Bank in 2012.<br/>"

Cultural impact.Western politics and society.In the West, political leaders have sometimes consulted astrologers.<br/>2. Louis de Wohl worked as an astrologer for the British intelligence agency MI5, after it was claimed that Hitler used astrology to time his actions.<br/>3. The War Office was ""interested to know what Hitler's own astrologers would be telling him from week to week"".<br/>4. In fact, de Wohl's predictions were so inaccurate that he was soon labelled a ""complete charlatan"" and it was later shown that Hitler considered astrology to be ""complete nonsense"".<br/>5. After John Hinckley's attempted assassination of U.S. President Ronald Reagan, first lady Nancy Reagan commissioned astrologer Joan Quigley to act as the secret White House astrologer.<br/>6. However, Quigley's role ended in 1988 when it became public through the memoirs of former chief of staff, Donald Regan.There was a boom in interest in astrology in the late 1960s.<br/>7. The sociologist Marcello Truzzi described three levels of involvement of ""Astrology-believers"" to account for its revived popularity in the face of scientific discrediting.<br/>8. He found that most astrology-believers did not claim it was a scientific explanation with predictive power.<br/>9. Instead, those superficially involved, knowing ""next to nothing"" about astrology's 'mechanics', read newspaper astrology columns, and could benefit from ""tension-management of anxieties"" and ""a cognitive belief-system that transcends science"".<br/>10. Those at the second level usually had their horoscopes cast and sought advice and predictions.<br/>11. They were much younger than those at the first level, and could benefit from knowledge of the language of astrology and the resulting ability to belong to a coherent and exclusive group.<br/>12. Those at the third level were highly involved and usually cast horoscopes for themselves.<br/>13. Astrology provided this small minority of astrology-believers with a """"meaningful"" view of their universe and them an ""understanding"" of their place in it.""<br/>14. This third group took astrology seriously, possibly as a ""sacred canopy"", whereas the other two groups took it playfully and irreverently.In 1953, sociologist Theodor W. Adorno conducted a study of the astrology column of a Los Angeles newspaper as part of a project examining mass culture in capitalist society.<br/>15. Adorno believed that popular astrology, as a device, invariably led to statements which encouraged conformity, and that astrologers who went against conformity with statement discouraging performance at work etc.<br/>16. would risk losing their jobs.<br/>17. Adorno concluded that astrology was a large-scale manifestation of systematic irrationalism, where individuals were subtly being led to believe that the author of the column was addressing them directly through the use of flattery and vague generalisations.<br/>18. Adorno drew a parallel with the phrase opium of the people, by Karl Marx, by commenting ""occultism is the metaphysic of the dopes"".A 2005 Gallup poll and a 2009 survey by the Pew Research Center reported that 25% of U.S. adults believe in astrology.<br/>"

The fossils are of Peking Man, an example of ""Homo erectus"" who used fire.<br/>4. The Peking Man site has also yielded remains of ""Homo sapiens"" dating back to 18,000–11,000 BCE.<br/>5. Some scholars assert that a form of proto-writing existed in China as early as 3000 BCE.According to Chinese tradition, the first imperial dynasty was the Xia, which emerged around 2070 BCE.<br/>6. However, the dynasty was considered mythical by historians until scientific excavations found early Bronze Age sites at Erlitou, Henan in 1959.<br/>7. It remains unclear whether these sites are the remains of the Xia Dynasty or of another culture from the same period.<br/>"

Italy-Cinema,"Category: Country<br/>Title: Italy<br/>Section: Cinema<br/><br/>1. The history of Italian cinema began a few months after the Lumière brothers began motion picture exhibitions.<br/>2. The first Italian film was a few seconds, showing Pope Leo XIII giving a blessing to the camera.<br/>3. The Italian film industry was born between 1903 and 1908 with three companies: the Società Italiana Cines, the Ambrosio Film and the Itala Film.<br/>4. Other companies soon followed in Milan and in Naples.<br/>5. In a short time these first companies reached a fair producing quality, and films were soon sold outside Italy.<br/>6. Cinema was later used by Benito Mussolini, who founded Rome's renowned Cinecittà studio for the production of Fascist propaganda until World War II.After the war, Italian film was widely recognised and exported until an artistic decline around the 1980s.<br/>7. Notable Italian film directors from this period include Vittorio De Sica, Federico Fellini, Sergio Leone, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Luchino Visconti, Michelangelo Antonioni and Dario Argento.<br/>8. Movies include world cinema treasures such as ""La dolce vita"", ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" and ""Bicycle Thieves"".<br/>9. The mid-1940s to the early 1950s was the heyday of neorealist films, reflecting the poor condition of post-war Italy.As the country grew wealthier in the 1950s, a form of neorealism known as pink neorealism succeeded, and other film genres, such as sword-and-sandal followed as spaghetti westerns, were popular in the 1960s and 1970s.<br/>10. In recent years, the Italian scene has received only occasional international attention, with movies like ""La vita è bella"" directed by Roberto Benigni, ""Il postino"" with Massimo Troisi and ""La grande bellezza"" directed by Paolo Sorrentino<br/>"
Cold_War-Chinese_Civil_War_and_SEATO,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Cold War<br/>Section: Chinese Civil War and SEATO<br/><br/>1. In 1949, Mao Zedong's People's Liberation Army defeated Chiang Kai-shek's United States-backed Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalist Government in China, and the Soviet Union promptly created an alliance with the newly formed People's Republic of China.<br/>2. According to Norwegian historian Odd Arne Westad, the Communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang Kai-Shek, and because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China.<br/>3. Moreover, his party was weakened in the war against Japanese.<br/>4. Meanwhile the Communists told different groups, such as peasants, exactly what they wanted to hear, and cloaked themselves in the cover of Chinese nationalism.Chiang and his KMT government retreated to the island of Taiwan.<br/>5. Confronted with the communist revolution in China and the end of the American atomic monopoly in 1949, the Truman administration quickly moved to escalate and expand the containment policy.<br/>6. In NSC-68, a secret 1950 document, the National Security Council proposed to reinforce pro-Western alliance systems and quadruple spending on defense.United States officials moved thereafter to expand containment into Asia, Africa, and Latin America, in order to counter revolutionary nationalist movements, often led by communist parties financed by the USSR, fighting against the restoration of Europe's colonial empires in South-East Asia and elsewhere.<br/>7. In the early 1950s (a period sometimes known as the ""Pactomania""), the US formalized a series of alliances with Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and the Philippines (notably ANZUS in 1951 and SEATO in 1954), thereby guaranteeing the United States a number of long-term military bases.<br/>"
Badminton-Comparisons_of_speed_and_athletic_requirements,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Badminton<br/>Section: Comparisons of speed and athletic requirements<br/><br/>1. Statistics such as the smash speed, above, prompt badminton enthusiasts to make other comparisons that are more contentious.<br/>2. For example, it is often claimed that badminton is the fastest racquet sport.<br/>3. Although badminton holds the record for the fastest initial speed of a racket sports projectile, the shuttlecock decelerates substantially faster than other projectiles such as tennis balls.<br/>4. In turn, this qualification must be qualified by consideration of the distance over which the shuttlecock travels: a smashed shuttlecock travels a shorter distance than a tennis ball during a serve.<br/>5. Badminton's claim as the fastest racquet sport might also be based on reaction time requirements, but arguably table tennis requires even faster reaction times.While fans of badminton and tennis often claim that their sport is the more physically demanding, such comparisons are difficult to make objectively because of the differing demands of the games.<br/>6. No formal study currently exists evaluating the physical condition of the players or demands during game play.<br/>"

Korean_War-UN_forces_cross_partition_line_(September_–_October_1950),"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Korean War<br/>Section: UN forces cross partition line (September – October 1950)<br/><br/>1. UN forces cross partition line (September – October 1950).On 27 September, MacArthur received the top secret National Security Council Memorandum 81/1 from Truman reminding him that operations north of the 38th parallel were authorized only if ""at the time of such operation there was no entry into North Korea by major Soviet or Chinese Communist forces, no announcements of intended entry, nor a threat to counter our operations militarily..."" On 29 September MacArthur restored the government of the Republic of Korea under Syngman Rhee.<br/>2. On 30 September, Defense Secretary George Marshall sent an eyes-only message to MacArthur: ""We want you to feel unhampered tactically and strategically to proceed north of the 38th parallel.""<br/>3. During October, the ROK police executed people who were suspected to be sympathetic to North Korea, and similar massacres were carried out until early 1951.On 30 September, Zhou Enlai warned the U.S. that China was prepared to intervene in Korea if the U.S. crossed the 38th parallel.<br/>4. Zhou attempted to advise North Korean commanders on how to conduct a general withdrawal by using the same tactics which had allowed Chinese communist forces to successfully escape Chiang Kai-shek's Encirclement Campaigns in the 1930s, but by some accounts North Korean commanders did not utilize these tactics effectively.<br/>5. Bruce Cumings argues, however, the KPA's rapid withdrawal was strategic, with troops melting into the mountains from where they could launch guerrilla raids on the UN forces spread out on the coasts.By 1 October 1950, the UN Command repelled the KPA northwards past the 38th parallel; the ROK Army crossed after them, into North Korea.<br/>6. MacArthur made a statement demanding the KPA's unconditional surrender.<br/>7. Six days later, on 7 October, with UN authorization, the UN Command forces followed the ROK forces northwards.<br/>8. The X Corps landed at Wonsan (in southeastern North Korea) and Riwon (in northeastern North Korea), already captured by ROK forces.<br/>9. The Eighth U.S. Army and the ROK Army drove up western Korea and captured Pyongyang city, the North Korean capital, on 19 October 1950.<br/>10. The 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team (""Rakkasans"") made their first of two combat jumps during the Korean War on 20 October 1950 at Sunchon and Sukchon.<br/>11. The missions of the 187th were to cut the road north going to China, preventing North Korean leaders from escaping from Pyongyang; and to rescue American prisoners of war.<br/>12. At month's end, UN forces held 135,000 KPA prisoners of war.Taking advantage of the UN Command's strategic momentum against the communists, General MacArthur believed it necessary to extend the Korean War into China to destroy depots supplying the North Korean war effort.<br/>13. President Truman disagreed, and ordered caution at the Sino-Korean border.<br/>"

Hey_Jude-Composition_and_structure,"Category: Music<br/>Title: Hey Jude<br/>Section: Composition and structure<br/><br/>1. <br/>2. ""Hey Jude"" begins with McCartney singing lead vocals and playing the piano.<br/>3. The patterns McCartney plays are based on three chords: F, C, and B-flat (I, V and IV); the second verse adds accompaniment by guitar and a single tambourine.<br/>4. The main chord progression is ""flipped on its head"" for the coda since the C chord is replaced by E-flat.<br/>5. Author Tim Riley notes, ""As Ringo offers a restrained tom-tom and cymbal fill, the piano shifts downward to add a flat seventh to the tonic chord, making the downbeat of the bridge the point of arrival ('And any time you feel the ""pain""').""<br/>6. At the end of each bridge, McCartney sings a brief phrase (""Na-na-na na ..."") and plays a piano fill which leads to the next verse; the phrase McCartney sings serves to ""reorient the harmony for the verse as the piano figure turns upside down into a vocal aside.""<br/>7. Additional details, such as tambourine on the third verse and subtle harmonies that accompany the lead vocal, are added to sustain the interest of the listener throughout the four-verse, two-bridge song.The verse-bridge structure of the song persists for approximately three minutes, after which the band leads into a four-minute-long coda.<br/>8. During the coda, the rest of the band, backed by an orchestra that also provides backing vocals, repeats the phrase ""Na-na-na na"" followed by the words ""hey Jude"" until the song gradually fades out.<br/>9. ""Time"" magazine described the coda as ""a fadeout that engagingly spoofs the fadeout as a gimmick for ending pop records.""<br/>10. Riley notes the repeated chord progression of the coda (I-VII-IV-I) ""answers all the musical questions raised at the beginnings and ends of bridges,"" for ""The flat seventh that pose dominant turns into bridges now has an entire chord built on it.""<br/>11. This three-chord refrain allows McCartney ""a bedding ... to leap about on vocally"", so he ad-libs his vocal performance for the rest of the song.<br/>12. Riley concludes that the song ""becomes a tour of Paul's vocal range: from the graceful inviting tones of the opening verse, through the mounting excitement of the song itself, to the surging raves of the coda.""<br/>"

There is no safe level of arsenic, but, as of 2012, a limit of 10 parts per billion has been established in the United States for drinking water, twice the level of 5 parts per billion originally proposed by the EPA.<br/>3. Consumption of one serving of some varieties of rice gives more exposure to arsenic than consumption of 1 liter of water that contains 5 parts per billion arsenic; however, the amount of arsenic in rice varies widely with the greatest concentration in brown rice and rice grown on land formerly used to grow cotton; in the United States, Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Texas.<br/>4. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is studying this issue, but has not established a limit.<br/>5. China has set a limit of 150 ppb for arsenic in rice.White rice grown in Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Texas, which account for 76 percent of American-produced rice had higher levels of arsenic than other regions of the world studied, possibly because of past use of arsenic-based pesticides to control cotton weevils.<br/>6.

Space_Race-Rocket_teams_assembled,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Space Race<br/>Section: Rocket teams assembled<br/><br/>1. The German rocket center in Peenemünde was located in the eastern part of Germany, which became the Soviet zone of occupation.<br/>2. On Stalin's orders, the Soviet Union sent its best rocket engineers to this region to see what they could salvage for future weapons systems.<br/>3. The Soviet rocket engineers were led by Sergei Korolev.<br/>4. He had been involved in space clubs and early Soviet rocket design in the 1930s, but was arrested in 1938 during Joseph Stalin's Great Purge and imprisoned for six years in Siberia.<br/>5. After the war, he became the USSR's chief rocket and spacecraft engineer, essentially the Soviet counterpart to von Braun.<br/>6. His identity was kept a state secret throughout the Cold War, and he was identified publicly only as ""the Chief Designer.""<br/>7. In the West, his name was only officially revealed when he died in 1966.After almost a year in the area around Peenemünde, Soviet officials moved most of the captured German rocket specialists to Gorodomlya Island on Lake Seliger, about northwest of Moscow.<br/>8. They were not allowed to participate in Soviet missile design, but were used as problem-solving consultants to the Soviet engineers.<br/>9. They helped in the following areas: the creation of a Soviet version of the A-4; work on ""organizational schemes""; research in improving the A-4 main engine; development of a 100-ton engine; assistance in the ""layout"" of plant production rooms; and preparation of rocket assembly using German components.<br/>10. With their help, particularly Helmut Groettrup's group, Korolev reverse-engineered the A-4 and built his own version of the rocket, the R-1, in 1948.<br/>11. Later, he developed his own distinct designs, though many of these designs were influenced by the Groettrup Group's G4-R10 design from 1949.<br/>12. The Germans were eventually repatriated in 1951–53.In America, Von Braun and his team were sent to the United States Army's White Sands Proving Ground, located in New Mexico, in 1945.<br/>13. They set about assembling the captured V2s and began a program of launching them and instructing American engineers in their operation.<br/>14. These tests led to the first rocket to take photos from outer space, and the first two-stage rocket, the WAC Corporal-V2 combination, in 1949.<br/>15. The German rocket team was moved from Fort Bliss to the Army's new Redstone Arsenal, located in Huntsville, Alabama, in 1950.<br/>16. From here, Von Braun and his team would develop the Army's first operational medium-range ballistic missile, the Redstone rocket, that would, in slightly modified versions, launch both America's first satellite, and the first piloted Mercury space missions.<br/>17. It became the basis for both the Jupiter and Saturn family of rockets.<br/>"

At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 70, based on 41 reviews, which indicates ""generally favorable reviews"".<br/>5. Additionally, the film was a success with audiences who, when polled by CinemaScore, awarded the film an A grade.James Berardinelli applauded Nolan and Goyer's work creating more understanding into ""who is and what motivates him"", something Berardinelli felt Tim Burton's film lacked; at the same time, Berardinelli felt the romantic aspect between Bale and Holmes did not work because the actors lacked the chemistry Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder (""Superman""), or Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst (""Spider-Man"") shared in their respective roles.<br/>6. According to ""Total Film"", Nolan manages to create such strong characters and story that the third-act action sequences cannot compare to ""the frisson of two people talking"", and Katie Holmes and Christian Bale's romantic subplot has a spark ""refreshingly free of Peter Parker/Mary Jane-style whining"".<br/>7. ""Los Angeles Times"" Kenneth Turan, who felt the film began slowly, stated that the ""story, psychology and reality, not special effects"", assisted the darkness behind Batman's arsenal; he noted that Neeson and Holmes, unlike Bale's ability to ""feel his role in his bones"", do not appear to fit their respective characters in ""being both comic-book archetypes and real people"".<br/>8. ""The New Yorker"" David Denby did not share Berardinelli and Turan's opinion.<br/>9. He was unimpressed with the film, when comparing it to the two Tim Burton films, and that Christian Bale's presence was hindered by the ""dull earnestness of the screenplay"", the final climax was ""cheesy and unexciting"", and that Nolan had resorted to imitating the ""fakery"" used by other filmmakers when filming action sequences.Michael Wilmington of the ""Chicago Tribune"" believed Nolan and Goyer managed to ""comfortably mix the tormented drama and revenge motifs with light hearted gags and comic book allusions,"" and that Nolan takes the series out of the ""slam-bang Hollywood jokefests"" the franchise had drifted into.<br/>10. Comic book scribe and editor Dennis O'Neil stated that he ""felt the filmmakers really understood the character they were translating"", citing this film as the best of the live-action ""Batman"" films.<br/>11. In contrast, J.R. Jones, from the ""Chicago Reader"", criticized the script, and Nolan and David Goyer for not living up to the ""hype about exploring Batman's damaged psyche"".<br/>12. Roger Ebert, who gave mixed reviews to the previous films, wrote this was ""the ""Batman"" movie I've been waiting for; more correctly, this is the movie I did not realize I was waiting for"".<br/>13. Giving it four out of four stars, he commended the realistic portrayals of the Batman arsenal – the Batsuit, Batcave, Tumbler, and the Batsignal – as well as the focus on ""the story and character"" with less stress on ""high-tech action"".Like Berardinelli, ""USA Today""s Mike Clark thought Bale performed the role of Batman as well as he did Patrick Bateman in ""American Psycho"", but that the relationship between Bruce Wayne and Rachel Dawes was ""frustratingly underdeveloped"".<br/>14. Kyle Smith thought Bale exhibited ""both the menace and the wit he showed in his brilliant turn in ""American Psycho"""", and that the film works so well because of the realism, stating, ""Batman starts stripping away each layer of Gotham crime only to discover a sicker and more monstrous evil beneath, his rancid city simultaneously invokes early '90s New York, when criminals frolicked to the tune of five murders a day; ""Serpico"" New York, when cops were for sale; and today, when psychos seek to kill us all at once rather than one by one.""<br/>15. In contrast, Salon.com's Stephanie Zacharek felt Nolan did not deliver the emotional depth expected of ""one of the most soulful and tortured superheroes of all""; she thought Bale, unlike Michael Keaton whom she compared him to, failed to connect with the audience underneath the mask, but that Gary Oldman succeeded in ""emotional complexity"" where the rest of the movie failed.Film director Tim Burton felt Nolan ""captured the real spirit that these kind of movies are supposed to have nowadays.<br/>16. When I did ""Batman"" twenty years ago, in 1988 or something, it was a different time in comic book movies.<br/>17. You couldn't go into that dark side of comics yet.<br/>18. The last couple of years that has become acceptable and Nolan certainly got more to the root of what the ""Batman"" comics are about.""<br/>"

Space Shuttle program (1972–2011).The Space Shuttle became the major focus of NASA in the late 1970s and the 1980s.<br/>2. Planned as a frequently launchable and mostly reusable vehicle, four space shuttle orbiters were built by 1985.<br/>3. The first to launch, ""Columbia"", did so on April 12, 1981, the 20th anniversary of the first space flight by Yuri Gagarin.Its major components were a spaceplane orbiter with an external fuel tank and two solid fuel launch rockets at its side.<br/>4. The external tank, which was bigger than the spacecraft itself, was the only component that was not reused.<br/>5. The shuttle could orbit in altitudes of 185–643 km (115–400 miles) and carry a maximum payload (to low orbit) of 24,400 kg (54,000 lb).<br/>6. Missions could last from 5 to 17 days and crews could be from 2 to 8 astronauts.On 20 missions (1983–98) the Space Shuttle carried Spacelab, designed in cooperation with the ESA.<br/>7. Spacelab was not designed for independent orbital flight, but remained in the Shuttle's cargo bay as the astronauts entered and left it through an airlock.<br/>8. Another famous series of missions were the launch and later successful repair of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and 1993, respectively.In 1995 Russian-American interaction resumed with the Shuttle-Mir missions (1995–1998).<br/>9. Once more an American vehicle docked with a Russian craft, this time a full-fledged space station.<br/>10. This cooperation has continued with Russia and the United States as the two of the biggest partners in the largest space station built: the International Space Station (ISS).<br/>11. The strength of their cooperation on this project was even more evident when NASA began relying on Russian launch vehicles to service the ISS during the two-year grounding of the shuttle fleet following the 2003 Space Shuttle ""Columbia"" disaster.The Shuttle fleet lost two orbiters and 14 astronauts in two disasters: ""Challenger"" in 1986, and ""Columbia"" in 2003.<br/>12. While the 1986 loss was mitigated by building the Space Shuttle ""Endeavour"" from replacement parts, NASA did not build another orbiter to replace the second loss.<br/>13. NASA's Space Shuttle program had 135 missions when the program ended with the successful landing of the Space Shuttle ""Atlantis"" at the Kennedy Space Center on July 21, 2011.<br/>14. The program spanned 30 years with over 300 astronauts sent into space.<br/>"
Mexico-Conquest_(1519),"Category: Country<br/>Title: Mexico<br/>Section: Conquest (1519)<br/><br/>1. Conquest (1519).The Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire began in February 1519 when Hernán Cortés arrived at the port in Veracruz with ca.<br/>2. 500 conquistadores, and later moved on to the Aztec capital.<br/>3. On his search for gold and other riches, Cortés decided to invade and conquer the Aztec empire.The ruler of the Aztec empire upon the arrival of the Spaniards was Moctezuma II, who was later killed; his successor and brother Cuitláhuac took control of the Aztec empire, but was among the first to fall from the smallpox epidemic a short time later.<br/>4. Unintentionally introduced by Spanish conquerors, smallpox ravaged Mesoamerica in the 1520s, killing more than 3 million Aztecs.<br/>5. Other sources, however, mentioned that the death toll of the Aztecs might have reached up to 15 million (out of a population of less than 30 million).<br/>6. Severely weakened, the Aztec empire was easily defeated by Cortés and his forces on his second return.Smallpox was a devastating and selective disease—it generally killed Aztecs but not Spaniards, who as Europeans had already been exposed to it for centuries and were therefore much more immune to it.<br/>7. The deaths caused by smallpox are believed to have triggered a rapid growth of Christianity in Mexico and the Americas.<br/>8. At first, the Aztecs believed the epidemic was a punishment from an angry god, but they later accepted their fate and no longer resisted the Spanish rule.<br/>9. Many of the surviving Aztecs blamed the cause of smallpox to the superiority of the Christian god, which resulted in the acceptance of Catholicism and yielding to the Spanish rule throughout Mexico.The territory became part of the Spanish Empire under the name of New Spain.<br/>10. Mexico City was systematically rebuilt by Cortés following the Fall of Tenochtitlan in 1521.<br/>11. Much of the identity, traditions and architecture of Mexico were created during the colonial period.<br/>"

The_Lord_of_the_Rings-Writing,"Category: Movies<br/>Title: The Lord of the Rings<br/>Section: Writing<br/><br/>1. Persuaded by his publishers, he started ""a new Hobbit"" in December 1937.<br/>2. After several false starts, the story of the One Ring emerged.<br/>3. The idea for the first chapter (""A Long-Expected Party"") arrived fully formed, although the reasons behind Bilbo's disappearance, the significance of the Ring, and the title ""The Lord of the Rings"" did not arrive until the spring of 1938.<br/>4. Originally, he planned to write a story in which Bilbo had used up all his treasure and was looking for another adventure to gain more; however, he remembered the Ring and its powers and thought that would be a better focus for the new work.<br/>5. As the story progressed, he also brought in elements from 'The Silmarillion' mythology.Writing was slow, because Tolkien had a full-time academic position, and needed to earn further money as a university examiner.<br/>6. Tolkien abandoned ""The Lord of the Rings"" during most of 1943 and only re-started it in April 1944, as a serial for his son Christopher Tolkien, who was sent chapters as they were written while he was serving in South Africa with the Royal Air Force.<br/>7. Tolkien made another concerted effort in 1946, and showed the manuscript to his publishers in 1947.<br/>8. The story was effectively finished the next year, but Tolkien did not complete the revision of earlier parts of the work until 1949.<br/>9.

World_War_I-New_states_under_war_zone,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: World War I<br/>Section: New states under war zone<br/><br/>1. In the late spring of 1918, three new states were formed in the South Caucasus: the First Republic of Armenia, the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Georgia, which declared their independence from the Russian Empire.<br/>2. Two other minor entities were established, the Centrocaspian Dictatorship and South West Caucasian Republic (the former was liquidated by Azerbaijan in the autumn of 1918 and the latter by a joint Armenian-British task force in early 1919).<br/>3. With the withdrawal of the Russian armies from the Caucasus front in the winter of 1917–18, the three major republics braced for an imminent Ottoman advance, which commenced in the early months of 1918.<br/>4. Solidarity was briefly maintained when the Transcaucasian Federative Republic was created in the spring of 1918, but this collapsed in May, when the Georgians asked and received protection from Germany and the Azerbaijanis concluded a treaty with the Ottoman Empire that was more akin to a military alliance.<br/>5.

England-Visual_arts,"Category: Country<br/>Title: England<br/>Section: Visual arts<br/><br/>1. The earliest known examples are the prehistoric rock and cave art pieces, most prominent in North Yorkshire, Northumberland and Cumbria, but also feature further south, for example at Creswell Crags.<br/>2. With the arrival of Roman culture in the 1st century, various forms of art utilising statues, busts, glasswork and mosaics were the norm.<br/>3. There are numerous surviving artefacts, such as those at Lullingstone and Aldborough.<br/>4. During the Early Middle Ages the style favoured sculpted crosses and ivories, manuscript painting, gold and enamel jewellery, demonstrating a love of intricate, interwoven designs such as in the Staffordshire Hoard discovered in 2009.<br/>5. Some of these blended Gaelic and Anglian styles, such as the Lindisfarne Gospels and Vespasian Psalter.<br/>6. Later Gothic art was popular at Winchester and Canterbury, examples survive such as Benedictional of St. Æthelwold and Luttrell Psalter.The Tudor era saw prominent artists as part of their court, portrait painting which would remain an enduring part of English art, was boosted by German Hans Holbein, natives such as Nicholas Hilliard built on this.<br/>7. Under the Stuarts, Continental artists were influential especially the Flemish, examples from the period include—Anthony van Dyck, Peter Lely, Godfrey Kneller and William Dobson.<br/>8. The 18th century was a time of significance with the founding of the Royal Academy, a classicism based on the High Renaissance prevailed—Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds became two of England's most treasured artists.The Norwich School continued the landscape tradition, while the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood with their vivid and detailed style revived the Early Renaissance style—Holman Hunt, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Everett Millais were leaders.<br/>9. Prominent amongst 20th-century artists was Henry Moore, regarded as the voice of British sculpture, and of British modernism in general.<br/>10.

Black_hole-Event_horizon,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Black hole<br/>Section: Event horizon<br/><br/>1. The defining feature of a black hole is the appearance of an event horizon—a boundary in spacetime through which matter and light can only pass inward towards the mass of the black hole.<br/>2. Nothing, not even light, can escape from inside the event horizon.<br/>3. The event horizon is referred to as such because if an event occurs within the boundary, information from that event cannot reach an outside observer, making it impossible to determine if such an event occurred.As predicted by general relativity, the presence of a mass deforms spacetime in such a way that the paths taken by particles bend towards the mass.<br/>4. At the event horizon of a black hole, this deformation becomes so strong that there are no paths that lead away from the black hole.To a distant observer, clocks near a black hole appear to tick more slowly than those further away from the black hole.<br/>5. Due to this effect, known as gravitational time dilation, an object falling into a black hole appears to slow down as it approaches the event horizon, taking an infinite time to reach it.<br/>6. At the same time, all processes on this object slow down, for a fixed outside observer, causing emitted light to appear redder and dimmer, an effect known as gravitational redshift.<br/>7. Eventually, at a point just before it reaches the event horizon, the falling object becomes so dim that it can no longer be seen.On the other hand, an indestructible observer falling into a black hole does not notice any of these effects as he crosses the event horizon.<br/>8. According to his own clock, which appears to him to tick normally, he crosses the event horizon after a finite time without noting any singular behaviour.<br/>9. In particular, he is unable to determine exactly when he crosses it, as it is impossible to determine the location of the event horizon from local observations.The shape of the event horizon of a black hole is always approximately spherical.<br/>10. For non-rotating (static) black holes the geometry is precisely spherical, while for rotating black holes the sphere is somewhat oblate.<br/>"
Stonehenge-Function_and_construction,"Category: Travel<br/>Title: Stonehenge<br/>Section: Function and construction<br/><br/>1. Stonehenge was produced by a culture that left no written records.<br/>2. Many aspects of Stonehenge remain subject to debate.<br/>3. This multiplicity of theories, some of them very colourful, are often called the ""mystery of Stonehenge"".<br/>4. A number of myths surround the stones.There is little or no direct evidence for the construction techniques used by the Stonehenge builders.<br/>5. Over the years, various authors have suggested that supernatural or anachronistic methods were used, usually asserting that the stones were impossible to move otherwise.<br/>6. However, conventional techniques, using Neolithic technology as basic as shear legs, have been demonstrably effective at moving and placing stones of a similar size.<br/>7. Proposed functions for the site include usage as an astronomical observatory or as a religious site.More recently two major new theories have been proposed.<br/>8. Professor Geoffrey Wainwright OBE, FSA, president of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and Professor Timothy Darvill, OBE of Bournemouth University have suggested that Stonehenge was a place of healing – the primeval equivalent of Lourdes.<br/>9. They argue that this accounts for the high number of burials in the area and for the evidence of trauma deformity in some of the graves.<br/>10. However they do concede that the site was probably multifunctional and used for ancestor worship as well.<br/>11. Isotope analysis indicates that some of the buried individuals were from other regions.<br/>12. A teenage boy buried approximately 1550 BC was raised near the Mediterranean Sea; a metal worker from 2300 BC dubbed the ""Amesbury Archer"" grew up near the alpine foothills of Germany; and the ""Boscombe Bowmen"" probably arrived from Wales or Brittany, France.<br/>13. On the other hand, Professor Mike Parker Pearson of Sheffield University has suggested that Stonehenge was part of a ritual landscape and was joined to Durrington Walls by their corresponding avenues and the River Avon.<br/>14. He suggests that the area around Durrington Walls Henge was a place of the living, whilst Stonehenge was a domain of the dead.<br/>15. A journey along the Avon to reach Stonehenge was part of a ritual passage from life to death, to celebrate past ancestors and the recently deceased.<br/>16. Both explanations were first mooted in the 12th century by Geoffrey of Monmouth (below), who extolled the curative properties of the stones and was also the first to advance the idea that Stonehenge was constructed as a funerary monument.<br/>17. Whatever religious, mystical or spiritual elements were central to Stonehenge, its design includes a celestial observatory function, which might have allowed prediction of eclipse, solstice, equinox and other celestial events important to a contemporary religion.Another theory, brought forth in 2012, suggests that the monument was intended to unify the different peoples of the British island.<br/>18. This theory suggests that the massive amount of labour involved in the construction of Stonehenge necessitated inter-regional cooperation, especially as many of the stones were moved over very long distances, for example from quarries in Wales.<br/>"

In March 1864, Ulysses S. Grant, the commanding general of all the Union's armies, decided to suspend the exchange of prisoners-of-war.<br/>2. As harsh as it may have been on the prisoners of both sides, Grant realized the exchange was prolonging the war by returning soldiers to the outnumbered and manpower-starved South.<br/>3. John Wilkes Booth, a Southerner and outspoken Confederate sympathizer, conceived a plan to kidnap President Lincoln and deliver him to the Confederate Army, to be held hostage until the North agreed to resume exchanging prisoners.<br/>4. Booth recruited Samuel Arnold, George Atzerodt, David Herold, Michael O'Laughlen, Lewis Powell (also known as ""Lewis Paine""), and John Surratt to help him.<br/>5. Surratt's mother, Mary Surratt, left her tavern in Surrattsville, Maryland, and moved to a house in Washington, D.C., where Booth became a frequent visitor.In late 1860, Booth had been initiated in the pro-Confederate Knights of the Golden Circle in Baltimore.<br/>6. He attended Lincoln's second inauguration on March 4, 1865, as the invited guest of his secret fiancée Lucy Hale, daughter of John P. Hale, soon to become United States Ambassador to Spain.<br/>7. Booth afterwards wrote in his diary, ""What an excellent chance I had, if I wished, to kill the President on Inauguration day!<br/>8. ""On March 17, 1865, Booth informed his conspirators that Lincoln would be attending a play, ""Still Waters Run Deep"", at Campbell Military Hospital.<br/>9. He assembled his men in a restaurant at the edge of town, intending that they should soon join him on a nearby stretch of road in order to capture the President on his way back from the hospital.<br/>10. But Booth found out that Lincoln had not gone to the play after all.<br/>11. Instead, he had attended a ceremony at the National Hotel in which officers of the 142nd Indiana Infantry presented Governor Oliver Morton with a captured Confederate battle flag.<br/>12. Booth was living at the National Hotel at the time and could have had an opportunity to kill Lincoln had Booth not been at the hospital.Meanwhile, the Confederacy was falling apart.<br/>13. On April 3, Richmond, Virginia, the Confederate capital, fell to the Union army.<br/>14. On April 9, the Army of Northern Virginia, the main army of the Confederacy, surrendered to the Army of the Potomac at Appomattox Court House.<br/>15. Confederate President Jefferson Davis and the rest of his government were in full flight.<br/>16. Despite many Southerners giving up hope, Booth continued to believe in his cause.On April 11, 1865, two days after Lee's army surrendered to Grant, Booth attended a speech at the White House in which Lincoln supported the idea of enfranchising the former slaves.<br/>17.

Archery-Protective_equipment,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Archery<br/>Section: Protective equipment<br/><br/>1. Most archers wear a bracer (also known as an arm-guard) to protect the inside of the bow arm from being hit by the string and prevent clothing from catching the bow string.<br/>2. The bracer does not brace the arm; the word comes from the armoury term ""brassard"", meaning an armoured sleeve or badge.<br/>3. The Navajo people have developed highly ornamented bracers as non-functional items of adornment.<br/>4. Some archers (mostly women) also wear protection on their chests, called chestguards or plastrons.<br/>5. The myth of the Amazons was that they had one breast removed to solve this problem.<br/>6. Roger Ascham mentions one archer, presumably with an unusual shooting style, who wore a leather guard for his face.The drawing digits are normally protected by a leather tab, glove, or thumb ring.<br/>7. A simple tab of leather is commonly used, as is a skeleton glove.<br/>8. Medieval Europeans probably used a complete leather glove.Eurasiatic archers who used the thumb or Mongolian draw protected their thumbs, usually with leather according to the author of ""Arab Archery"", but also with special rings of various hard materials.<br/>9. Many surviving Turkish and Chinese examples are works of considerable art.<br/>10. Some are so highly ornamented that the users could not have used them to loose an arrow.<br/>11. Possibly these were items of personal adornment, and hence value, remaining extant whilst leather had virtually no intrinsic value and would also deteriorate with time.<br/>12. In traditional Japanese archery a special glove is used, provided with a ridge which is used to draw the string.<br/>"
Chernobyl_disaster-The_Exclusion_Zone,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Chernobyl disaster<br/>Section: The Exclusion Zone<br/><br/>1. An area originally extending in all directions from the plant is officially called the ""zone of alienation"".<br/>2. It is largely uninhabited, except for about 300 residents who have refused to leave.<br/>3. The area has largely reverted to forest, and has been overrun by wildlife because of a lack of competition with humans for space and resources.<br/>4. Even today, radiation levels are so high that the workers responsible for rebuilding the sarcophagus are only allowed to work five hours a day for one month before taking 15 days of rest.<br/>5. Ukrainian officials estimate the area will not be safe for human life again for another 20,000 years.In 2011 Ukraine opened up the sealed zone around the Chernobyl reactor to tourists who wish to learn more about the tragedy that occurred in 1986.<br/>"
Prison_Break-Season_2,"Category: Tv<br/>Title: Prison Break<br/>Section: Season 2<br/><br/>1. The second season begins eight hours after the escape, focusing mainly on the eight escapees.<br/>2. Series creator Paul Scheuring describes the second season as """"The Fugitive"" times eight"" and likens it to the ""second half of ""The Great Escape"".""<br/>3. The fugitives split up and journey to locations across the country with the authorities close behind them as they each pursue their individual goals.<br/>4. Brad Bellick (Wade Williams) gets fired from the prison where he worked as the main guard and chases after the inmates himself for the reward money.<br/>5. Several of the escapees reunite in search of a large cache of money buried long ago by another Fox River inmate, Charles Westmoreland (Muse Watson).<br/>6. Federal agent Alexander Mahone (William Fichtner) is assigned to track down and capture the eight fugitives, but is revealed to be working for The Company, which wants all eight men dead.<br/>7. When Sara discovers her father, Governor Frank Tancredi (John Heard), has been killed, she meets with Michael, remaining with him as the brothers try to bring down now-President Reynolds, a Company member.<br/>8. To ensure the brothers' safety, Sara allows herself to be arrested and faces trial.<br/>9. During the trial, the testimony of former Secret Service agent Paul Kellerman (Paul Adelstein), who used to work for the Company-controlled President, exonerates Lincoln and Sara.<br/>10. Half of the escapees are killed or recaptured, but the brothers make it to Panama.<br/>11. Michael, T-Bag, Mahone, and Bellick are arrested by the Panamanian authorities and imprisoned at the Penitenciaría Federal de Sona.<br/>"
Japan-Languages,"Category: Country<br/>Title: Japan<br/>Section: Languages<br/><br/>1. More than 99 percent of the population speaks Japanese as their first language.<br/>2. Japanese is an agglutinative language distinguished by a system of honorifics reflecting the hierarchical nature of Japanese society, with verb forms and particular vocabulary indicating the relative status of speaker and listener.<br/>3. Japanese writing uses kanji (Chinese characters) and two sets of kana (syllabaries based on simplified Chinese characters), as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals.Besides Japanese, the Ryukyuan languages (Amami, Kunigami, Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama, Yonaguni), also part of the Japonic language family, are spoken in the Ryukyu Islands chain.<br/>4. Few children learn these languages, but in recent years the local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages.<br/>5. The Okinawan Japanese dialect is also spoken in the region.<br/>6. The Ainu language, which has no proven relationship to Japanese or any other language, is moribund, with only a few elderly native speakers remaining in Hokkaido.<br/>7. Most public and private schools require students to take courses in both Japanese and English.<br/>"
Grand_Canyon-Plants,"Category: Travel<br/>Title: Grand Canyon<br/>Section: Plants<br/><br/>1. Biology and ecology.Plants.There are approximately 1,737 known species of vascular plants, 167 species of fungi, 64 species of moss and 195 species of lichen found in Grand Canyon National Park.<br/>2. This variety is largely due to the 8,000 foot elevation change from the Colorado River up to the highest point on the North Rim.<br/>3. Grand Canyon boasts a dozen endemic plants (known only within the Park's boundaries) while only ten percent of the Park's flora is exotic.<br/>4. Sixty-three plants found here have been given special status by the U.S.<br/>5. Fish and Wildlife Service.The Mojave Desert influences the western sections of the canyon, Sonoran Desert vegetation covers the eastern sections, and ponderosa and pinyon pine forests grow on both rims.Natural seeps and springs percolating out of the canyon walls are home to 11% of all the plant species found in the Grand Canyon.<br/>6. The Canyon itself can act as a connection between the east and the west by providing corridors of appropriate habitat along its length.<br/>7. The canyon can also be a genetic barrier to some species, like the Tassel-eared squirrel.The aspect, or direction a slope faces, also plays a major role in adding diversity to the Grand Canyon.<br/>8. North-facing slopes receive about one-third the normal amount of sunlight, so plants growing there are similar to plants found at higher elevations, or in more northern latitudes.<br/>9. The south-facing slopes receive the full amount of sunlight and are covered in vegetation typical of the Sonoran Desert.<br/>"
Disneyland-Lands,"Category: Travel<br/>Title: Disneyland<br/>Section: Lands<br/><br/>1.

The park opened with ""Main Street, U.S.A."", ""Adventureland"", ""Frontierland"", ""Fantasyland"", and ""Tomorrowland"", and has since added New Orleans Square in 1966, Bear Country (later Critter Country) in 1972, and Mickey's Toontown in 1993.<br/>3. In 1957, Holidayland, opened to the public with a recreation area including a circus and baseball diamond, but was closed in late 1961.<br/>4. It is often referred to as the ""lost"" land of Disneyland.<br/>5. Throughout the park are 'Hidden Mickeys', representations of Mickey Mouse heads inserted subtly into the design of attractions and environmental decor.<br/>6. An elevated berm supports the narrow gauge Disneyland Railroad that circumnavigates the park.<br/>"
Leonardo_da_Vinci-Early_works,"Category: Art<br/>Title: Leonardo da Vinci<br/>Section: Early works<br/><br/>1. Leonardo's early works begin with the ""Baptism of Christ"" painted in conjunction with Verrocchio.<br/>2. Two other paintings appear to date from his time at the workshop, both of which are Annunciations.<br/>3. One is small, long and high.<br/>4. It is a ""predella"" to go at the base of a larger composition, in this case a painting by Lorenzo di Credi from which it has become separated.<br/>5. The other is a much larger work, long.<br/>6. In both these Annunciations, Leonardo used a formal arrangement, such as in Fra Angelico's two well-known pictures of the same subject, of the Virgin Mary sitting or kneeling to the right of the picture, approached from the left by an angel in profile, with a rich flowing garment, raised wings and bearing a lily.<br/>7. Although previously attributed to Ghirlandaio, the larger work is now generally attributed to Leonardo.In the smaller picture Mary averts her eyes and folds her hands in a gesture that symbolised submission to God's will.<br/>8. In the larger picture, however, Mary is not submissive.<br/>9. The girl, interrupted in her reading by this unexpected messenger, puts a finger in her bible to mark the place and raises her hand in a formal gesture of greeting or surprise.<br/>10. This calm young woman appears to accept her role as the Mother of God, not with resignation but with confidence.<br/>11. In this painting the young Leonardo presents the humanist face of the Virgin Mary, recognising humanity's role in God's incarnation.<br/>"

In 2012, the South Korean government announced that ""Gangnam Style"" had brought in $13.4 million to the country’s audio sector, and it subsequently launched a campaign to further expand the K-Pop music industry overseas.<br/>2. According to the Bank of Korea, the country's services account recorded a surplus of USD 2.3 billion in the first nine months of this year, compared to a deficit of USD 4.5 billion last year.<br/>3. This was mainly due to the growing influence and popularity of K-pop songs such as ""Gangnam Style"".<br/>4. However, the American journalist John Seabrook noted that by ""satirizing standard K-pop tropes in Gangnam Style"", Psy may have subverted the music genre's chances of making it big in the West.<br/>"
Great_Sphinx_of_Giza-Mythology,"Category: Art<br/>Title: Great Sphinx of Giza<br/>Section: Mythology<br/><br/>1. Colin Reader has proposed that the Sphinx was probably the focus of solar worship in the Early Dynastic Period, before the Giza Plateau became a necropolis in the Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2134 BC).<br/>2. He ties this in with his conclusions that the Sphinx, the Sphinx temple, the Causeway and the Khafra mortuary temple are all part of a complex which predates Dynasty IV (c. 2613–2494 BC).<br/>3. The lion has long been a symbol associated with the sun in ancient Near Eastern civilizations.<br/>4. Images depicting the Egyptian king in the form of a lion smiting his enemies date as far back as the Early Dynastic Period.In the New Kingdom, the Sphinx became more specifically associated with the god ""Hor-em-akhet"" (Hellenized: ""Harmachis"") or Horus at the Horizon, which represented the pharaoh in his role as the ""Shesep-ankh"" (English: ""Living Image"") of the god Atum.<br/>5. Pharaoh Amenhotep II (1427–1401 or 1397 BC) built a temple to the north east of the Sphinx nearly 1000 years after its construction, and dedicated it to the cult of ""Hor-em-akhet"".<br/>"

Germany-Media,"Category: Country<br/>Title: Germany<br/>Section: Media<br/><br/>1. German cinema dates back to the earliest years of the medium, it has made major technical and artistic contributions to film, as with the work of Max Skladanowsky, who showed the first film sequences ever to an audience, in 1895.<br/>2. Early German cinema was particularly influential with German expressionists such as Robert Wiene and Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau.<br/>3. Director Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" (1927) is referred to as the first modern science-fiction film.<br/>4. In 1930 Josef von Sternberg directed ""The Blue Angel"", the first major German sound film.During the 1970s and 1980s, New German Cinema directors such as Volker Schlöndorff, Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, and Rainer Werner Fassbinder put West German cinema on the international stage.<br/>5. The annual European Film Awards ceremony is held every other year in Berlin, home of the European Film Academy (EFA); the Berlin Film Festival, held annually since 1951, is one of the world's foremost film festivals.In the 21st century, several German movies have had international success, such as ""Nowhere in Africa"" (2001), ""Das Experiment"" (2001), ""Good Bye, Lenin!""<br/>6.

Russia-Architecture,"Category: Country<br/>Title: Russia<br/>Section: Architecture<br/><br/>1. Since the Christianization of Kievan Rus' for several ages Russian architecture was influenced predominantly by the Byzantine architecture.<br/>2. Apart from fortifications (kremlins), the main stone buildings of ancient Rus' were Orthodox churches with their many domes, often gilded or brightly painted.Aristotle Fioravanti and other Italian architects brought Renaissance trends into Russia since the late 15th century, while the 16th century saw the development of unique tent-like churches culminating in Saint Basil's Cathedral.<br/>3. By that time the onion dome design was also fully developed.<br/>4. In the 17th century, the ""fiery style"" of ornamentation flourished in Moscow and Yaroslavl, gradually paving the way for the Naryshkin baroque of the 1690s.<br/>5. After the reforms of Peter the Great the change of architectural styles in Russia generally followed that in the Western Europe.The 18th-century taste for rococo architecture led to the ornate works of Bartolomeo Rastrelli and his followers.<br/>6. The reigns of Catherine the Great and her grandson Alexander I saw the flourishing of Neoclassical architecture, most notably in the capital city of Saint Petersburg.<br/>7. The second half of the 19th century was dominated by the Neo-Byzantine and Russian Revival styles.<br/>8. Prevalent styles of the 20th century were the Art Nouveau, Constructivism, and the Stalin Empire style.In 1955, a new Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, condemned the ""excesses"" of the former academic architecture, and the late Soviet era was dominated by plain functionalism in architecture.<br/>9. This helped somewhat to resolve the housing problem, but created a large quantity of buildings of low architectural quality, much in contrast with the previous bright styles.<br/>10. The situation improved in the recent two decades.<br/>11. Many temples demolished in Soviet times were rebuilt, and this process continues along with the restoration of various historical buildings destroyed in World War II.<br/>12. A total of 23,000 Orthodox churches have been rebuilt between 1991 and 2010, which effectively quadrapled the number of operating churches in Russia.<br/>"

Industrial_Revolution-Transportation,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Industrial Revolution<br/>Section: Transportation<br/><br/>1. At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, inland transport was by navigable rivers and roads, with coastal vessels employed to move heavy goods by sea.<br/>2. Railways or wagon ways were used for conveying coal to rivers for further shipment, but canals had not yet been constructed.<br/>3. Animals supplied all of the motive power on land, with sails providing the motive power on the sea.The Industrial Revolution improved Britain's transport infrastructure with a turnpike road network, a canal and waterway network, and a railway network.<br/>4.

Great_Wall_of_China-Early_walls,"Category: Travel<br/>Title: Great Wall of China<br/>Section: Early walls<br/><br/>1. History.Early walls.The Chinese were already familiar with the techniques of wall-building by the time of the Spring and Autumn period between the 8th and 5th centuries BC.<br/>2. During this time and the subsequent Warring States period, the states of Qin, Wei, Zhao, Qi, Yan and Zhongshan all constructed extensive fortifications to defend their own borders.<br/>3. Built to withstand the attack of small arms such as swords and spears, these walls were made mostly by stamping earth and gravel between board frames.Qin Shi Huang conquered all opposing states and unified China in 221 BC, establishing the Qin Dynasty.<br/>4. Intending to impose centralized rule and prevent the resurgence of feudal lords, he ordered the destruction of the wall sections that divided his empire along the former state borders.<br/>5. To position the empire against the Xiongnu people from the north, he ordered the building of new walls to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire's northern frontier.<br/>6. Transporting the large quantity of materials required for construction was difficult, so builders always tried to use local resources.<br/>7. Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges, while rammed earth was used for construction in the plains.<br/>8. There are no surviving historical records indicating the exact length and course of the Qin Dynasty walls.<br/>9. Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries, and very few sections remain today.The human cost of the construction is unknown, but it has been estimated by some authors that hundreds of thousands,if not up to a million, workers died building the Qin wall.<br/>10. Later, the Han, Sui, and the Northern dynasties all repaired, rebuilt, or expanded sections of the Great Wall at great cost to defend themselves against northern invaders.<br/>11. The Tang and Song Dynasties did not build any walls in the region substantially.<br/>12. The Liao, Jin, and Yuan dynasties, who ruled Northern China throughout most of the 10th–13th centuries, constructed defensive walls in the 12th century, but those were located much to the north of the Great Wall as we know it, within today's Inner and Outer Mongolia.<br/>"
Taekwondo-Safety,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Taekwondo<br/>Section: Safety<br/><br/>1. Although taekwondo competitors have an apparently substantial risk of injury, most injuries are minor.<br/>2. A 2009 meta-analysis reported that an average of about 8% of competitors are injured per exposure to competition.<br/>3. Age, gender, and level of play did not significantly affect the injury rate.<br/>4. The legs are the most common location for injuries, and bruising is the most common injury type.Injuries may occur if students are taught to block punches in a formal manner (chamber position, perfect angles, etc.)<br/>5. even when sparring.<br/>6. When comparing the speed of a punch and the reaction time taken to block effectively, it is difficult to block a punch.<br/>7. Many taekwondo schools teach students blocking for grading and classwork, and dodging or parrying for sparring.<br/>"
France-Society,"Category: Country<br/>Title: France<br/>Section: Society<br/><br/>1. According to a BBC poll in 2010, based on 29,977 responses in 28 countries, France is globally seen as a positive influence in the world's affairs: 49% have a positive view of the country's influence, whereas 19% have a negative view.<br/>2. The Nation Brand Index of 2008 suggested that France has the second best international reputation, only behind Germany.According to a poll in 2011, the French were found to have the highest level of religious tolerance and to be the country where the highest proportion of the population defines its identity primarily in term of nationality and not religion.<br/>3. 69% of French have a favourable view of the US, making France one of the most pro-American countries in the world.In January 2010, the magazine International Living ranked France as ""best country to live in"", ahead of 193 other countries, for the fifth year running.The French Revolution continues to permeate the country's collective memory.<br/>4. The tricolour flag, the anthem ""La Marseillaise"", and the motto Liberté, egalité, fraternité, defined in Title 1 of the Constitution as national symbols, all emerged during the cultural ferment of the early revolution, along with Marianne, a common national personification.<br/>5. In addition, Bastille Day, the national holiday, commemorates the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789.A common and traditional symbol of the French people is the Gallic rooster.<br/>6. Its origins date back to Antiquity, since the Latin word Gallus meant both ""rooster"" and ""inhabitant of Gaul"".<br/>7. Then this figure gradually became the most widely shared representation of the French, used by French monarchs, then by the Revolution and under the successive republican regimes as representation of the national identity, used for some stamps and coins.<br/>"
South_Korea-Architecture,"Category: Country<br/>Title: South Korea<br/>Section: Architecture<br/><br/>1. Because of South Korea's tumultuous history, construction and destruction has been repeated endlessly, resulting in an interesting melange of architectural styles and designs.Korean traditional architecture is characterized by its harmony with nature.<br/>2. Ancient architects adopted the bracket system characterized by thatched roofs and heated floors called ""ondol"".<br/>3. People of the upper classes built bigger houses with elegantly curved tiled roofs with lifting eaves.<br/>4. Traditional architecture can be seen in the palaces and temples, preserved old houses called ""hanok"", and special sites like Hahoe Folk Village, Yangdong Village of Gyeongju and Korean Folk Village.<br/>5. Traditional architecture may also be seen at the nine UNESCO World Heritage Sites in South Korea.Western architecture was first introduced to Korea at the end of the 19th century.<br/>6. Churches, offices for foreign legislation, schools and university buildings were built in new styles.<br/>7. With the annexation of Korea by Japan in 1910 the colonial regime intervened in Korea's architectural heritage, and Japanese-style modern architecture was imposed.<br/>8. The anti-Japanese sentiment, and the Korean War, led to the destruction of most buildings constructed during that time.Korean architecture entered a new phase of development during the post-Korean War reconstruction, incorporating modern architectural trends and styles.<br/>9. Stimulated by the economic growth in the 1970s and 1980s, active redevelopment saw new horizons in architectural design.<br/>10. In the aftermath of the 1988 Seoul Olympics, South Korea has witnessed a wide variation of styles in its architectural landscape due, in large part, to the opening up of the market to foreign architects.<br/>11. Contemporary architectural efforts have been constantly trying to balance the traditional philosophy of ""harmony with nature"" and the fast-paced urbanization that the country has been going through in recent years.<br/>"
Bacteria-Movement,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Bacteria<br/>Section: Movement<br/><br/>1. Many bacteria can move using a variety of mechanisms: flagella are used for swimming through fluids; bacterial gliding and twitching motility move bacteria across surfaces; and changes of buoyancy allow vertical motion.Swimming bacteria frequently move near 10 body lengths per second and a few as fast as 100.<br/>2. This makes them at least as fast as fish, on a relative scale.In bacterial gliding and twitching motility, bacteria use their type IV pili as a grappling hook, repeatedly extending it, anchoring it and then retracting it with remarkable force (>80 pN).<br/>3. Flagella are semi-rigid cylindrical structures that are rotated and function much like the propeller on a ship.<br/>4. Objects as small as bacteria operate a low Reynolds number and cylindrical forms are more efficient than the flat, paddle-like, forms appropriate at human-size scale.Bacterial species differ in the number and arrangement of flagella on their surface; some have a single flagellum (monotrichous), a flagellum at each end (amphitrichous), clusters of flagella at the poles of the cell (lophotrichous), while others have flagella distributed over the entire surface of the cell (peritrichous).<br/>5. The bacterial flagella is the best-understood motility structure in any organism and is made of about 20 proteins, with approximately another 30 proteins required for its regulation and assembly.<br/>6. The flagellum is a rotating structure driven by a reversible motor at the base that uses the electrochemical gradient across the membrane for power.<br/>7. This motor drives the motion of the filament, which acts as a propeller.Many bacteria (such as ""E. coli"") have two distinct modes of movement: forward movement (swimming) and tumbling.<br/>8. The tumbling allows them to reorient and makes their movement a three-dimensional random walk.<br/>9. (See external links below for link to videos.)<br/>10. The flagella of a unique group of bacteria, the spirochaetes, are found between two membranes in the periplasmic space.<br/>11. They have a distinctive helical body that twists about as it moves.Motile bacteria are attracted or repelled by certain stimuli in behaviors called taxes: these include chemotaxis, phototaxis, energy taxis, and magnetotaxis.<br/>12. In one peculiar group, the myxobacteria, individual bacteria move together to form waves of cells that then differentiate to form fruiting bodies containing spores.<br/>13. The myxobacteria move only when on solid surfaces, unlike ""E. coli"", which is motile in liquid or solid media.Several ""Listeria"" and ""Shigella"" species move inside host cells by usurping the cytoskeleton, which is normally used to move organelles inside the cell.<br/>14. By promoting actin polymerization at one pole of their cells, they can form a kind of tail that pushes them through the host cell's cytoplasm.<br/>"

Love_the_Way_You_Lie-Production,"Category: Music<br/>Title: Love the Way You Lie<br/>Section: Production<br/><br/>1. Music video.Production.The music video for ""Love the Way You Lie"" was Eminem's third to be directed by the American filmmaker Joseph Kahn.<br/>2. Despite having planned to shoot a feature film and stop directing pop videos, Kahn chose to work on ""Love the Way You Lie"" because, according to him, the song discusses an important topic.<br/>3. This was an opportunity for him to direct a video for Eminem without the comedic themes of their previous collaborations.<br/>4. For the video, Kahn considered the British actor Dominic Monaghan as a co-star for his versatility, which he thought would help him play an antagonist.<br/>5. Kahn cast the American actress Megan Fox, which he had presumed would be almost impossible because of her popularity with directors.<br/>6. Fox, a fan of Eminem, accepted the role unhesitatingly.Rosenberg gave Kahn one day to write a treatment, which Kahn finished in forty-five minutes.<br/>7. He filmed Eminem's and Rihanna's parts on July 20, 2010; scenes with Fox and Monaghan were shot three days later.<br/>8. By July 24, 2010, they had finished the shoot.<br/>9. Kahn confirmed the completion of the director's cut the next day.<br/>10. He said Fox's involvement made the video powerful, commenting for ""Vibe"":We wanted to make a specific story about two people—Meg and Dom—not a video that was representative of all couples or all domestic violence situations.<br/>11. I'm not saying that all couples fight this way.<br/>12. I just want people just to be able to identify with the characters and recognize that they've seen relationships like this where two people are together that are completely wrong for each other and things spiral out of control.<br/>13. ... Megan was the key to this video.<br/>14. ...<br/>15. I'll tell you as a director the reason why and Monaghan's scenes in the video feel so real is because in the moment they were real.Monaghan told MTV he thought the couple represents Eminem and Scott.<br/>16. The clip was produced by Kathy Angstadt and Maryann Tanedo of HSI Productions.<br/>17. Shortly before its release, Eminem reported in a press statement: ""Joseph and I worked pretty closely together to make sure we got this right"".<br/>18. He said the difficult topic resulted in a powerful video because of the contributions of Rihanna, Fox and Monaghan.<br/>19. Fox donated her appearance fee to the Soujourn House, a battered women's shelter.<br/>20. On August 5, 2010, the video premiered on MTV and the music video website Vevo.<br/>"

Telescope-Types,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Telescope<br/>Section: Types<br/><br/>1. The name ""telescope"" covers a wide range of instruments.<br/>2. Most detect electromagnetic radiation, but there are major differences in how astronomers must go about collecting light (electromagnetic radiation) in different frequency bands.Telescopes may be classified by the wavelengths of light they detect:<br/>3. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X-ray telescopes, using shorter wavelengths than ultraviolet light<br/>4. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultraviolet telescopes, using shorter wavelengths than visible light<br/>5. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Optical telescopes, using visible light<br/>6. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Infrared telescopes, using longer wavelengths than visible light<br/>7. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Submillimetre telescopes, using longer wavelengths than infrared light<br/><br/>8. As wavelengths become longer, it becomes easier to use antenna technology to interact with electromagnetic radiation (although it is possible to make very tiny antenna).</br>9. The near-infrared can be handled much like visible light, however in the far-infrared and submillimetre range, telescopes can operate more like a radio telescope.<br/>10. For example the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope observes from wavelengths from 3 μm (0.003 mm) to 2000 μm (2 mm), but uses a parabolic aluminum antenna.<br/>11. On the other hand, the Spitzer Space Telescope, observing from about 3 μm (0.003 mm) to 180 μm (0.18 mm) uses a mirror (reflecting optics).<br/>12. Also using reflecting optics, the Hubble Space Telescope with Wide Field Camera 3 can observe from about 0.2 μm (0.0002 mm) to 1.7 μm (0.0017 mm) (from ultra-violet to infrared light).<br/>13. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fresnel Imager, an optical lens technology<br/>14. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X-ray optics, optics for certain X-ray wavelengths<br/><br/>15. Another threshold in telescope design, as photon energy increases (shorter wavelengths and higher frequency) is the use of fully reflecting optics rather than glancing-incident optics.</br>16. Telescopes such as TRACE and SOHO use special mirrors to reflect Extreme ultraviolet, producing higher resolution and brighter images then otherwise possible.<br/>17. A larger aperture does not just mean more light is collected, it is collected at a higher diffraction limit.Telescopes may also be classified by location: ground telescope, space telescope, or flying telescope.<br/>18. They may also be classified by whether they are operated by professional astronomers or amateur astronomers.<br/>19. A vehicle or permanent campus containing one or more telescopes or other instruments is called an observatory.<br/>"
Parks_and_Recreation-Abstract,"Category: Tv<br/>Title: Parks and Recreation<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. Parks and Recreation is an American comedy television series on the NBC television network, starring Amy Poehler as Leslie Knope, a perky, mid-level bureaucrat in the parks department of Pawnee, a fictional town in Indiana.<br/>2. Conceived by Greg Daniels and Michael Schur, the series debuted on April 9, 2009 and is currently airing its sixth season, which began on September 26, 2013.<br/>3. The show was renewed for a seventh season by NBC on January 19, 2014.<br/>4. It uses a single-camera, mockumentary filming style, with the implication being that a documentary crew is filming everyone.<br/>5. The ensemble and supporting cast features Amy Poehler, Rashida Jones, Aziz Ansari, Nick Offerman, Aubrey Plaza, Paul Schneider, Chris Pratt, Adam Scott, Rob Lowe, Jim O'Heir, and Retta.The writers researched local California politics for the show, and consulted with urban planners and elected officials.<br/>6. Poehler's character of Leslie Knope underwent minor changes after the first season in response to audience feedback that she seemed unintelligent and ""ditzy"".<br/>7. The writing staff tried to incorporate current events into their episodes, such as a government shutdown in Pawnee inspired by the real-life global financial crisis.<br/>8. Several guest stars have been featured in the show, and these characters often appear in multiple episodes.<br/>9. ""Parks and Recreation"" received generally mixed reviews during its first season.<br/>10. However, after a reapproach to its format and tone, its second and subsequent seasons received much higher critical acclaim.<br/>11. ""Parks and Recreation"" has received several awards and nominations, including a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Comedy Series, four Emmy nominations and a Golden Globe win for Poehler's performance, and a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy.<br/>12. In ""Time""s 2012 year-end lists issue, ""Parks and Recreation"" was named the number one television series.<br/>13. In 2013, after receiving four consecutive nominations in the category, ""Parks and Recreation"" won the Television Critics Association Award for Outstanding Achievement in Comedy.<br/>14. ""Parks and Recreation"" has regularly been a part of NBC's ""Comedy Night Done Right"" programming during their Thursday night prime-time block.<br/>"

A homemade setup is widely used as a cheap and simple alternative to pressurized CO2 systems.<br/>3. While not as effective as these, the homemade setup is considerably cheaper for less-demanding hobbyists.Several recipes for homemade CO2 are available, but they are variations of the basic recipe: Baker's yeast, with sugar, baking soda, and water, are added to a plastic bottle.<br/>4. A few drops of vegetable oil at the start reduces surface tension and speeds the release of CO2.<br/>5. This will produce CO2 for about two or three weeks; the use of a bubble counter determines production.<br/>6. The CO2 is injected in the aquarium through a narrow hose and released through a diffuser that helps dissolve the gas in the water.<br/>7. The CO2 is used by plants in the photosynthesis process.<br/>"

Williams got hold of the book from his children, and when he brought it to DreamWorks, it caught Jeffrey Katzenberg's attention and the studio decided to make it into a movie.<br/>2. Recounting the inspiration of making the film, Williams said: After buying the rights to the film, Katzenberg quickly put the film in active development in November 1995.<br/>3. Steven Spielberg had thought about making a traditionally animated film of the book before, when he bought the rights to the book in 1991, before the founding of DreamWorks, where Bill Murray would play Shrek and Steve Martin would play Donkey.<br/>4. In the beginning of production, co-director Andrew Adamson refused to be intimidated by Katzenberg, and had an argument with him how much should the film appeal to adults.<br/>5. Katzenberg wanted both audiences, but he found some of Adamson's ideas about adding sexual jokes and Guns N' Roses music to the soundtrack a bit too outrageous.<br/>6. Andrew Adamson and Kelly Asbury joined in 1997 to co-direct the film.<br/>7. However, Asbury left a year later for work on the 2002 film """", and was replaced with story artist Vicky Jenson.<br/>8. Both Adamson and Jenson decided to work on the film in half, so the crew could at least know who to go to with specific detail questions about the film's sequences; ""We both ended up doing a lot of everything"", Adamson said.<br/>9. ""We're both kinda control freaks, and we both wanted to do everything.<br/>10. ""Some early sketches of Shrek's house were done in 1996 through 1997 using Photoshop, with the sketches showing Shrek first living in a garbage dump near a human village called Wart Creek.<br/>11. It was also thought one time that he lived with his parents and kept rotting fish in his bedroom.<br/>12. Donkey was modeled after ""Pericles"" (born 1994; also known as ""Perry""), a real miniature donkey from Barron Park, Palo Alto, California.<br/>13. Raman Hui, supervising animator of ""Shrek"", stated that Fiona ""wasn't based on any real person.""<br/>14. and he did many different sketches for Princess Fiona and had done over 100 sculptures of Fiona before the directors picked the final design.<br/>15. In early development, the Art Directors visited Hearst Castle, Stratford upon Avon and Dordogne for inspiration.<br/>16.

According to Cancer Research UK, the results of the large-scale study published in 2012 clarified the evidence of the effect of coffee drinking on cancer, and that evidence beforehand had been conflicting.<br/>2. They say the study showed that drinking coffee ""had no effect on the risk of dying from cancer.<br/>3. ""Other studies suggest coffee consumption reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease, dementia, Parkinson's disease, heart disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, and gout.The fact that decaffeinated coffee also exhibits preventative effects against diseases such as prostate cancer and type 2 diabetes suggests that coffee's health benefits are not solely a product of its caffeine content.Specifically, the antidiabetic effect of caffeine has been attributed to caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid.The presence of antioxidants in coffee has been shown to prevent free radicals from causing cell damage.<br/>4. Evidence suggests that roasted coffee has a stronger antioxidant effect than green coffee.Coffee is no longer thought to be a risk factor for coronary heart disease.<br/>5. A 2012 meta-analysis concluded that people who drank moderate amounts of coffee had a lower rate of heart failure, with the biggest effect found for those who drank more than four cups a day.Moreover, habitual coffee consumption is associated with improved vascular function.In a ten year study among 50,739 US women (mean age, 63 years) free of depressive symptoms at baseline (in 1996), coffee consumption was negatively correlated with risk of developing depression.A review published in 2004 indicated a negative correlation between suicide rates and coffee consumption.It was suggested that the action of caffeine in blocking the inhibitory effects of adenosine on dopamine nerves in the brain reduced feelings of depression.Coffee consumption is also associated with improved endothelial function.<br/>6. Coffee extracts have been shown to inhibit 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, enzyme which converts cortisone to cortisol and is a current pharmaceutical target for the treatment of diabetes type 2 and the metabolic syndrome.<br/>"

For several generations, his family had been small-scale bankers in Florence, the bank had failed and his father, Ludovico di Leonardo Buonarroti Simoni, briefly took a government post in Caprese, where Michelangelo was born.<br/>4. At the time of Michelangelo's birth, his father was the Judicial administrator of the small town of Caprese and local administrator of Chiusi.<br/>5. Michelangelo's mother was Francesca di Neri del Miniato di Siena.<br/>6. The Buonarrotis claimed to descend from the Countess Mathilde of Canossa; this claim remains unproven, but Michelangelo himself believed it.<br/>7. Several months after Michelangelo's birth, the family returned to Florence, where Michelangelo was raised.<br/>8. At later times, during his mother's prolonged illness and after her death in 1481, when he was just six years old, Michelangelo lived with a stonecutter and his wife and family in the town of Settignano, where his father owned a marble quarry and a small farm.<br/>9.

""Free Bird"" is included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll, and at number 193 in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.<br/>3. In 2009 it was named the 26th best hard rock song of all time by VH1.The song—half ballad, half up-tempo guitar solo—quickly became a staple for Lynyrd Skynyrd at their live performances.<br/>4. Many recognize its 5:12 triple guitar solo section that closes it out.<br/>5. It often turned into an extended jam session at concerts.<br/>6. The band would consistently play it as the last song of every show, as it was their biggest crowd pleaser.<br/>7. Overall the song proved to be a huge hit for Lynyrd Skynyrd and it remains a fan favorite to this day.<br/>8. It is also a classic rock radio staple.Following the plane crash in 1977 in which several band members were killed, all of the songs played by surviving members were performed as instrumentals beginning with the Charlie Daniels Volunteer Jam V in 1979.<br/>9. When ""Free Bird"" came up, a solitary microphone with a single spotlight would be at center stage while the band played the instrumental version.<br/>10. This tradition lasted until 1989, when an almost-rioting audience coerced Rossington to urge Johnny Van Zant to sing the song for the first time – something he had vowed never to do on stage during the Tribute Tour.<br/>11.

They are emission nebulae with spectra similar to those of emission nebulae found in star formation regions.<br/>3. Technically they are HII regions, because most hydrogen will be ionized, but they are denser and more compact than the nebulae in star formation regions.<br/>4. Planetary nebulae were given their name by the first astronomical observers who became able to distinguish them from planets, who tended to confuse them with planets, of more interest to them.<br/>5. Our Sun is expected to spawn a planetary nebula about 12 billion years after its formation.<br/>"
Physics-Astrophysics,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Physics<br/>Section: Astrophysics<br/><br/>1. Astrophysics and astronomy are the application of the theories and methods of physics to the study of stellar structure, stellar evolution, the origin of the solar system, and related problems of cosmology.<br/>2. Because astrophysics is a broad subject, astrophysicists typically apply many disciplines of physics, including mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and molecular physics.The discovery by Karl Jansky in 1931 that radio signals were emitted by celestial bodies initiated the science of radio astronomy.<br/>3. Most recently, the frontiers of astronomy have been expanded by space exploration.<br/>4. Perturbations and interference from the earth's atmosphere make space-based observations necessary for infrared, ultraviolet, gamma-ray, and X-ray astronomy.Physical cosmology is the study of the formation and evolution of the universe on its largest scales.<br/>5. Albert Einstein's theory of relativity plays a central role in all modern cosmological theories.<br/>6. In the early 20th century, Hubble's discovery that the universe is expanding, as shown by the Hubble diagram, prompted rival explanations known as the steady state universe and the Big Bang.The Big Bang was confirmed by the success of Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the discovery of the cosmic microwave background in 1964.<br/>7. The Big Bang model rests on two theoretical pillars: Albert Einstein's general relativity and the cosmological principle.<br/>8. Cosmologists have recently established the ΛCDM model of the evolution of the universe, which includes cosmic inflation, dark energy, and dark matter.Numerous possibilities and discoveries are anticipated to emerge from new data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope over the upcoming decade and vastly revise or clarify existing models of the universe.<br/>9. In particular, the potential for a tremendous discovery surrounding dark matter is possible over the next several years.<br/>10. Fermi will search for evidence that dark matter is composed of weakly interacting massive particles, complementing similar experiments with the Large Hadron Collider and other underground detectors.IBEX is already yielding new astrophysical discoveries: ""No one knows what is creating the ENA (energetic neutral atoms) ribbon"" along the termination shock of the solar wind, ""but everyone agrees that it means the textbook picture of the heliosphere — in which the solar system's enveloping pocket filled with the solar wind's charged particles is plowing through the onrushing 'galactic wind' of the interstellar medium in the shape of a comet — is wrong.""<br/>"
Association_football-International_competitions,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Association football<br/>Section: International competitions<br/><br/>1. The major international competition in football is the World Cup, organised by FIFA.<br/>2. This competition takes place over every four years.<br/>3. Approximately 190–200 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental confederations for a place in the finals.<br/>4. The finals tournament, which is held every four years, involves 32 national teams competing over a four-week period.<br/>5. The most recent tournament, the 2010 FIFA World Cup, was held in South Africa from 11 June to 11 July, the first to be held on the African continent.There has been a football tournament at every Summer Olympic Games since 1900, except at the 1932 games in Los Angeles.<br/>6. Before the inception of the World Cup, the Olympics (especially during the 1920s) had the same status as the World Cup.<br/>7. Originally, the event was for amateurs only; however, since the 1984 Summer Olympics, professional players have been permitted, albeit with certain restrictions which prevent countries from fielding their strongest sides.<br/>8. The Olympic men's tournament is played at Under-23 level.<br/>9. In the past the Olympics have allowed a restricted number of over-age players per team;.<br/>10. A women's tournament was added in 1996; in contrast to the men's event, full international sides without age restrictions play the women's Olympic tournament.After the World Cup, the most important international football competitions are the continental championships, which are organised by each continental confederation and contested between national teams.<br/>11. These are the European Championship (UEFA), the Copa América (CONMEBOL), African Cup of Nations (CAF), the Asian Cup (AFC), the CONCACAF Gold Cup (CONCACAF) and the OFC Nations Cup (OFC).<br/>12. The FIFA Confederations Cup is contested by the winners of all six continental championships, the current FIFA World Cup champions and the country which is hosting the Confederations Cup.<br/>13. This is generally regarded as a warm-up tournament for the upcoming FIFA World Cup and does not carry the same prestige as the World Cup itself.<br/>14. The most prestigious competitions in club football are the respective continental championships, which are generally contested between national champions, for example the UEFA Champions League in Europe and the Copa Libertadores de América in South America.<br/>15.

Climate_change-Orbital_variations,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Climate change<br/>Section: Orbital variations<br/><br/>1. External forcing mechanisms.Orbital variations.Slight variations in Earth's orbit lead to changes in the seasonal distribution of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface and how it is distributed across the globe.<br/>2. There is very little change to the area-averaged annually averaged sunshine; but there can be strong changes in the geographical and seasonal distribution.<br/>3. The three types of orbital variations are variations in Earth's eccentricity, changes in the tilt angle of Earth's axis of rotation, and precession of Earth's axis.<br/>4. Combined together, these produce Milankovitch cycles which have a large impact on climate and are notable for their correlation to glacial and interglacial periods, their correlation with the advance and retreat of the Sahara, and for their appearance in the stratigraphic record.The IPCC notes that Milankovitch cycles drove the ice age cycles, CO2 followed temperature change ""with a lag of some hundreds of years,"" and that as a feedback amplified temperature change.<br/>5. The depths of the ocean have a lag time in changing temperature (thermal inertia on such scale).<br/>6.

The International Shooting Sport Federation still administers Olympic and non-Olympic rifle, pistol, shotgun, and running target shooting competitions, although there is also a large number of national and international shooting sports controlled by unrelated organizations.Shooting technique differs depending on factors like the type of firearm used (from a handgun to a sniper rifle; the distance to and nature of the target; the required precision; and the available time.<br/>4. Breathing and position play an important role when handling a handgun or a rifle.<br/>5. Some shooting sports, such as IPSC shooting, make a sport of combat style shooting.<br/>6.

Football-Official_disapproval_and_attempts_to_ban_football,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Football<br/>Section: Official disapproval and attempts to ban football<br/><br/>1. Numerous attempts have been made to ban football games, particularly the most rowdy and disruptive forms.<br/>2. This was especially the case in England and in other parts of Europe, during the Middle Ages and early modern period.<br/>3. Between 1324 and 1667, football was banned in England alone by more than 30 royal and local laws.<br/>4. The need to repeatedly proclaim such laws demonstrated the difficulty in enforcing bans on popular games.King Edward II was so troubled by the unruliness of football in London that on April 13, 1314 he issued a proclamation banning it: ""Forasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large balls from which many evils may arise which God forbid; we command and forbid, on behalf of the King, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future.<br/>5. ""The reasons for the ban by Edward III, on June 12, 1349, were explicit: football and other recreations distracted the populace from practicing archery, which was necessary for war.<br/>6. In 1424, the Parliament of Scotland passed a Football Act that stated ""it is statut and the king forbiddis that na man play at the fut ball under the payne of iiij d"" – in other words, playing football was made illegal, and punishable by a fine of four pence.By 1608, the local authorities in Manchester were complaining that: ""With the ffotebale...hath beene greate disorder in our towne of Manchester we are told, and glasse windowes broken yearlye and spoyled by a companie of lewd and disordered persons ..."" That same year, the word""football"" was used disapprovingly by William Shakespeare.<br/>7. Shakespeare's play ""King Lear"" contains the line: ""Nor tripped neither, you base football player"" (Act I, Scene 4).Shakespeare also mentions the game in ""A Comedy of Errors"" (Act II, Scene 1):""Spurn"" literally means ""to kick away"", thus implying that the game involved kicking a ball between players.King James I of England's ""Book of Sports"" (1618) however, instructs Christians to play at football every Sunday afternoon after worship.<br/>8. The book's aim appears to be an attempt to offset the strictness of the Puritans regarding the keeping of the Sabbath.<br/>"
Cloning-Ethical_issues_of_cloning,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Cloning<br/>Section: Ethical issues of cloning<br/><br/>1. In bioethics, the ethics of cloning' refers to a variety of ethical positions regarding the practice and possibilities of cloning, especially human cloning.<br/>2. While many of these views are religious in origin, the questions raised by cloning are faced by secular perspectives as well.<br/>3. Perspectives on human cloning are theoretical, as human therapeutic and reproductive cloning are not commercially used; animals are currently cloned in laboratories and in livestock production.Advocates support development of therapeutic cloning in order to generate tissues and whole organs to treat patients who otherwise cannot obtain transplants, to avoid the need for immunosuppressive drugs, and to stave off the effects of aging.<br/>4. Advocates for reproductive cloning believe that parents who cannot otherwise procreate should have access to the technology.Opponents of cloning have concerns that technology is not yet developed enough to be safe, that it could be prone to abuse (leading to the generation of humans from whom organs and tissues would be harvested), and have concerns about how cloned individuals could integrate with families and with society at large.Religious groups are divided, with some opposing the technology as usurping God's place and, to the extent embryos are used, destroying a human life; others support therapeutic cloning's potential life-saving benefits.Cloning of animals is opposed by animal-groups due to the number of cloned animals that suffer from malformations before they die, and while food from cloned animals has been approved by the US FDA, its use is opposed by groups concerned about food safety.<br/>"

President Richard M. Nixon viewed the proceedings from the Oval Office of the White House.A Saturn V launched Apollo 11 from Launch Pad 39A, part of the Launch Complex 39 site at the Kennedy Space Center on July 16, 1969 at 13:32:00 UTC (9:32:00 a.m. EDT local time).<br/>3. It entered orbit twelve minutes later.<br/>4. After one and a half orbits, the S-IVB third-stage engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon with the Trans-Lunar Injection (TLI) burn at 16:22:13 UTC.<br/>5. About 30 minutes later the command/service module pair separated from this last remaining Saturn V stage and docked with the Lunar Module still nestled in the Lunar Module Adaptor.<br/>6. After the Lunar Module was extracted, the combined spacecraft headed for the Moon, while the third stage booster flew on a trajectory past the Moon and into heliocentric orbit.On July 19 at 17:21:50 UTC, Apollo 11 passed behind the Moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit.<br/>7. In the thirty orbits that followed, the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern Sea of Tranquility (Mare Tranquillitatis) about southwest of the crater Sabine D (0.67408N, 23.47297E).<br/>8. The landing site was selected in part because it had been characterized as relatively flat and smooth by the automated ""Ranger 8"" and ""Surveyor 5"" landers along with the ""Lunar Orbiter"" mapping spacecraft and unlikely to present major landing or extra-vehicular activity (EVA) challenges.<br/>"
Yosemite_National_Park-Uplift_and_erosion,"Category: Travel<br/>Title: Yosemite National Park<br/>Section: Uplift and erosion<br/><br/>1. Starting 10 million years ago, vertical movement along the Sierra fault started to uplift the Sierra Nevada.<br/>2. Subsequent tilting of the Sierra block and the resulting accelerated uplift of the Sierra Nevada increased the gradient of western-flowing streams.<br/>3. The streams consequently ran faster and thus cut their valleys more quickly.<br/>4. Additional uplift occurred when major faults developed to the east, especially the creation of Owens Valley from Basin and Range-associated extensional forces.<br/>5. Uplift of the Sierra accelerated again about two million years ago during the Pleistocene.The uplifting and increased erosion exposed granitic rocks in the area to surface pressures, resulting in exfoliation (responsible for the rounded shape of the many domes in the park) and mass wasting following the numerous fracture joint planes (cracks; especially vertical ones) in the now solidified plutons.<br/>6. Pleistocene glaciers further accelerated this process and the larger ones transported the resulting talus and till from valley floors.Numerous vertical joint planes controlled where and how fast erosion took place.<br/>7. Most of these long, linear and very deep cracks trend northeast or northwest and form parallel, often regularly spaced sets.<br/>8. They were created by uplift-associated pressure release and by the unloading of overlying rock via erosion.<br/>"
Baseball-Abstract,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Baseball<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players who take turns batting and fielding.The offense attempts to score runs by hitting a ball thrown by the pitcher with a bat and moving counter-clockwise around a series of four bases: first, second, third and home plate.<br/>2. A run is scored when the runner advances around the bases and returns to home plate.Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways.<br/>3. A player on the batting team can stop at any of the bases and later advance on a teammate's hit or other means.<br/>4. The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs.<br/>5. One turn at bat for both teams, beginning with the visiting team, constitutes an inning, and nine innings a game.<br/>6. The team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins.Evolving from older bat-and-ball games, an early form of baseball was being played in England by the mid-18th century.<br/>7. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed.<br/>8. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States.<br/>9. Baseball is now popular in North America and parts of Central and South America and the Caribbean, East Asia and Europe.In the United States and Canada, professional Major League Baseball (MLB) teams are divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central.<br/>10. The major league champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series.<br/>11.

This was followed in 1999 by ', a party video game featuring quizzes and mini-games, on the Dreamcast, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and PC.<br/>4. In 2000, ""South Park Rally"", a racing game, was released on the Dreamcast, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and PC.<br/>5. Parker and Stone had little to do with the development of these games, apart from providing voice acting, and have publicly criticized Acclaim and the quality of the ""South Park"" games they produced.<br/>6. Several years after these early games, the decision was made to form a small group called South Park Digital Studios, which would, among other things, work on creating new ""South Park"" games, that would involve the studio and the show's creators more heavily.<br/>7.

Fight_Club-Abstract,"Category: Movies<br/>Title: Fight Club<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. Fight Club is a 1999 American film based on the 1996 novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk.<br/>2. The film was directed by David Fincher and stars Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter.<br/>3. Norton plays the unnamed protagonist, an ""everyman"" who is discontented with his white-collar job.<br/>4. He forms a ""fight club"" with soap maker Tyler Durden, played by Pitt, and they are joined by men who also want to fight recreationally.<br/>5. The narrator becomes embroiled in a relationship with Durden and a dissolute woman, Marla Singer, played by Bonham Carter.Palahniuk's novel was optioned by 20th Century Fox producer Laura Ziskin, who hired Jim Uhls to write the film adaptation.<br/>6. Fincher was one of four directors the producers considered.<br/>7. They hired him because of his enthusiasm for the film.<br/>8. Fincher developed the script with Uhls and sought screenwriting advice from the cast and others in the film industry.<br/>9. The director and the cast compared the film to ""Rebel Without a Cause"" (1955) and ""The Graduate"" (1967).<br/>10. Fincher intended ""Fight Club""s violence to serve as a metaphor for the conflict between a generation of young people and the value system of advertising.<br/>11. The director copied the homoerotic overtones from Palahniuk's novel to make audiences uncomfortable and keep them from anticipating the twist ending.Studio executives did not like the film and they restructured Fincher's intended marketing campaign to try to reduce anticipated losses.<br/>12. ""Fight Club"" failed to meet the studio's expectations at the box office and received polarized reactions from critics.<br/>13. It was cited as one of the most controversial and talked-about films of 1999.<br/>14. However, the film over the years found critical and commercial success with its DVD release, which established ""Fight Club"" as a cult film.<br/>"
Aurora-Frequency_of_occurrence,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Aurora<br/>Section: Frequency of occurrence<br/><br/>1. Auroras are occasionally seen in temperate latitudes, when a magnetic storm temporarily enlarges the auroral oval.<br/>2. Large magnetic storms are most common during the peak of the eleven-year sunspot cycle or during the three years after that peak.<br/>3. Within the auroral zone the likelihood of an aurora occurring depends mostly on the slant of interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) lines (the slant is known as Bz), however, being greater with southward slants.Geomagnetic storms that ignite auroras actually happen more often during the months around the equinoxes.<br/>4. It is not well understood why geomagnetic storms are tied to Earth's seasons while polar activity is not.<br/>5. But it is known that during spring and autumn, the interplanetary magnetic field and that of Earth link up.<br/>6. At the magnetopause, Earth's magnetic field points north.<br/>7. When Bz becomes large and negative (i.e., the IMF tilts south), it can partially cancel Earth's magnetic field at the point of contact.<br/>8. South-pointing Bzs open a door through which energy from the solar wind reaches Earth's inner magnetosphere.The peaking of Bz during this time is a result of geometry.<br/>9. The IMF comes from the Sun and is carried outward with the solar wind.<br/>10. The rotation of the Sun causes the IMF to have a spiral shape called the Parker spiral.<br/>11. The southward (and northward) excursions of Bz are greatest during April and October, when Earth's magnetic dipole axis is most closely aligned with the Parker spiral.Bz is not the only influence on geomagnetic activity, however, the Sun's rotation axis is tilted 8 degrees with respect to the plane of Earth's orbit.<br/>12. The solar wind blows more rapidly from the Sun's poles than from its equator, thus the average speed of particles buffeting Earth's magnetosphere waxes and wanes every six months.<br/>13. The solar wind speed is greatest – by about 50 km/s, on average – around 5 September and 5 March when Earth lies at its highest heliographic latitude.Still, neither Bz nor the solar wind can fully explain the seasonal behavior of geomagnetic storms.<br/>14. Those factors together contribute only about one-third of the observed semiannual variations.<br/>"
Mona_Lisa-Frame,"Category: Art<br/>Title: Mona Lisa<br/>Section: Frame<br/><br/>1. Because the ""Mona Lisa""'s poplar support expands and contracts with changes in humidity, the picture has experienced some warping.<br/>2. In response to warping and swelling experienced during its storage during World War II, and to prepare the picture for an exhibit to honor the anniversary of Leonardo's 500th birthday, the ""Mona Lisa"" was fitted in 1951 with a flexible oak frame with beech crosspieces.<br/>3. This flexible frame, which is used in addition to the decorative frame described below, exerts pressure on the panel to keep it from warping further.<br/>4. In 1970, the beech crosspieces were switched to maple after it was found that the beechwood had been infested with insects.<br/>5. In 2004–2005, a conservation and study team replaced the maple crosspieces with sycamore ones, and an additional metal crosspiece was added for scientific measurement of the panel's warp.The ""Mona Lisa"" has had many different decorative frames in its history, owing to changes in taste over the centuries.<br/>6. In 1909, the Comtesse de Béhague gave the portrait its current frame, a Renaissance-era work consistent with the historical period of the ""Mona Lisa"".<br/>7. The edges of the painting have been trimmed at least once in its history to fit the picture into various frames, but no part of the original paint layer has been trimmed.<br/>"
Colosseum-Supporting_buildings,"Category: Travel<br/>Title: Colosseum<br/>Section: Supporting buildings<br/><br/>1. The Colosseum and its activities supported a substantial industry in the area.<br/>2. In addition to the amphitheatre itself, many other buildings nearby were linked to the games.<br/>3. Immediately to the east is the remains of the ""Ludus Magnus"", a training school for gladiators.<br/>4. This was connected to the Colosseum by an underground passage, to allow easy access for the gladiators.<br/>5. The ""Ludus Magnus"" had its own miniature training arena, which was itself a popular attraction for Roman spectators.<br/>6. Other training schools were in the same area, including the ""Ludus Matutinus"" (Morning School), where fighters of animals were trained, plus the Dacian and Gallic Schools.Also nearby were the ""Armamentarium"", comprising an armory to store weapons; the ""Summum Choragium"", where machinery was stored; the ""Sanitarium"", which had facilities to treat wounded gladiators; and the ""Spoliarium"", where bodies of dead gladiators were stripped of their armor and disposed of.Around the perimeter of the Colosseum, at a distance of 18 m (59 ft) from the perimeter, was a series of tall stone posts, with five remaining on the eastern side.<br/>7. Various explanations have been advanced for their presence; they may have been a religious boundary, or an outer boundary for ticket checks, or an anchor for the ""velarium"" or awning.Right next to the Colosseum is also the Arch of Constantine.<br/>"

It earned $81.5 million in theatrical rentals in North America during its initial release, increasing its earnings to $85.7 million through a reissue in 1973, and including a limited re-release in 1997 it ultimately earned an equivalent exhibition gross of $135 million.<br/>4. It displaced ""Gone with the Wind"" to claim the record as the top rentals earner, a position it would retain until the release of ""Jaws"" in 1975.<br/>5. News articles at the time proclaimed it was the first film to gross $100 million in North America, but such accounts are erroneous since this record in fact belongs to ""The Sound of Music"", released in 1965.<br/>6. The film repeated its native success overseas, earning in total an unprecedented $142 million in worldwide theatrical rentals, to become the highest net earner.<br/>7. Profits were so high for ""The Godfather"" that earnings for Gulf & Western Industries, Inc., which owned Paramount Pictures, jumped from seventy-seven cents per share to three dollars and thirty cents a share for the year, according to a ""Los Angeles Times"" article, dated December 13, 1972.<br/>8.

The first movie the Wachowskis directed, ""Bound"", then became a critical success.<br/>4. Using this momentum, the brothers later asked to direct ""The Matrix"".Producer Joel Silver soon joined the project.<br/>5. Although the project had key supporters like Silver and Di Bonaventura to influence the company, ""The Matrix"" was still a huge investment for Warner Bros, which had to invest $60 million to create a movie with deep philosophical ideas and difficult special effects.<br/>6. The Wachowskis therefore hired underground comic book artists Geof Darrow and Steve Skroce to draw a 600-page, shot-by-shot storyboard for the entire film.<br/>7. The storyboard eventually earned the studio's approval, and it was decided to film in Australia to make the most of the budget.<br/>8.

Volleyball-Set,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Volleyball<br/>Section: Set<br/><br/>1. The set is usually the second contact that a team makes with the ball.<br/>2. The main goal of setting is to put the ball in the air in such a way that it can be driven by an attack into the opponent's court.<br/>3. The setter coordinates the offensive movements of a team, and is the player who ultimately decides which player will actually attack the ball.As with passing, one may distinguish between an overhand and a bump set.<br/>4. Since the former allows for more control over the speed and direction of the ball, the bump is used only when the ball is so low it cannot be properly handled with fingertips, or in beach volleyball where rules regulating overhand setting are more stringent.<br/>5. In the case of a set, one also speaks of a front or back set, meaning whether the ball is passed in the direction the setter is facing or behind the setter.<br/>6. There is also a jump set that is used when the ball is too close to the net.<br/>7. In this case the setter usually jumps off his or her right foot straight up to avoid going into the net.<br/>8. The setter usually stands about ⅔ of the way from the left to the right of the net and faces the left (the larger portion of net that he or she can see).Sometimes a setter refrains from raising the ball for a teammate to perform an attack and tries to play it directly onto the opponent's court.<br/>9. This movement is called a ""dump"".<br/>10. This can only be performed when the setter is in the front row, otherwise it constitutes an illegal back court attack.<br/>11. The most common dumps are to 'throw' the ball behind the setter or in front of the setter to zones 2 and 4.<br/>12. More experienced setters toss the ball into the deep corners or spike the ball on the second hit.<br/>"

The four Grand Slam tournaments are considered to be the most prestigious tennis events in the world.<br/>2. They are held annually and comprise, in chronological order, the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open.<br/>3. Apart from the Olympic Games, Davis Cup, Fed Cup, and Hopman Cup, they are the only tournaments regulated by the International Tennis Federation (ITF).<br/>4. The ITF's national associations, Tennis Australia (Australian Open), the Fédération Française de Tennis (French Open), the Lawn Tennis Association (Wimbledon) and the United States Tennis Association (US Open) are delegated the responsibility to organize these events.Aside from the historical significance of these events, they also carry larger prize funds than any other tour event and are worth double the number of ranking points to the champion than in the next echelon of tournaments, the Masters 1000 (men) and Premier events (women).<br/>5. Another distinguishing feature is the number of players in the singles draw.<br/>6. There are 128, more than any other professional tennis tournament.<br/>7. This draw is composed of 32 seeded players, other players ranked in the world's top 100, qualifiers, and players who receive invitations through wild cards.<br/>8. Grand Slam men's tournaments have best-of-five set matches while the women play best-of-three.<br/>9. Grand Slam tournaments are among the small number of events that last two weeks, the others being the Indian Wells Masters and the Miami Masters.Currently, the Grand Slam tournaments are the only tour events that have mixed doubles contests.<br/>10. Grand Slam tournaments are held in conjunction with wheelchair tennis tournaments and junior tennis competitions.<br/>11. These tournaments also contain their own idiosyncrasies.<br/>12. For example, players at Wimbledon are required to wear predominantly white.<br/>13. Andre Agassi chose to skip Wimbledon from 1988 through 1990 citing the event's traditionalism, particularly its ""predominantly white"" dress code.<br/>14.

Canada-Aboriginal_peoples,"Category: Country<br/>Title: Canada<br/>Section: Aboriginal peoples<br/><br/>1. History.Aboriginal peoples.Archaeological studies and genetic analyses have indicated a human presence in the northern Yukon region from 24,500 BC, and in southern Ontario from 7500 BC.The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada.<br/>2. The characteristics of Canadian Aboriginal societies included permanent settlements,agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks.<br/>3. Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, and have only been discovered through archeological investigations.The aboriginal population at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000 and two million, with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada's Royal Commission on Aboriginal Health.<br/>4. As a consequence of the European colonization, Canada's aboriginal peoples suffered from repeated outbreaks of newly introduced infectious diseases such as influenza, measles, and smallpox (to which they had no natural immunity), resulting in a forty- to eighty-percent population decrease in the centuries after the European arrival.Aboriginal peoples in present-day Canada include the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis.<br/>5. The Métis are a mixed-blood people who originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations and Inuit people married European settlers.<br/>6.

Great_Depression-Japan,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Great Depression<br/>Section: Japan<br/><br/>1. The Great Depression did not strongly affect Japan.<br/>2. The Japanese economy shrank by 8% during 1929–31.<br/>3. Japan's Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo was the first to implement what have come to be identified as Keynesian economic policies: first, by large fiscal stimulus involving deficit spending; and second, by devaluing the currency.<br/>4. Takahashi used the Bank of Japan to sterilize the deficit spending and minimize resulting inflationary pressures.<br/>5. Econometric studies have identified the fiscal stimulus as especially effective.The devaluation of the currency had an immediate effect.<br/>6. Japanese textiles began to displace British textiles in export markets.<br/>7. The deficit spending proved to be most profound.<br/>8. The deficit spending went into the purchase of munitions for the armed forces.<br/>9. By 1933, Japan was already out of the depression.<br/>10. By 1934, Takahashi realized that the economy was in danger of overheating, and to avoid inflation, moved to reduce the deficit spending that went towards armaments and munitions.This resulted in a strong and swift negative reaction from nationalists, especially those in the army, culminating in his assassination in the course of the February 26 Incident.<br/>11. This had a chilling effect on all civilian bureaucrats in the Japanese government.<br/>12. From 1934, the military's dominance of the government continued to grow.<br/>13. Instead of reducing deficit spending, the government introduced price controls and rationing schemes that reduced, but did not eliminate inflation, which would remain a problem until the end of World War II.The deficit spending had a transformative effect on Japan.<br/>14. Japan's industrial production doubled during the 1930s.<br/>15. Further, in 1929 the list of the largest firms in Japan was dominated by light industries, especially textile companies (many of Japan's automakers, like Toyota, have their roots in the textile industry).<br/>16. By 1940 light industry had been displaced by heavy industry as the largest firms inside the Japanese economy.<br/>"
Das_Boot-Reception,"Category: Movies<br/>Title: Das Boot<br/>Section: Reception<br/><br/>1. The film drew highest critical acclaim and is seen as one of the greatest of all German films.<br/>2.

"SeaWorld-SeaWorld_Ohio_sale,_re-birth,_and_eventual_transition","Category: Travel<br/>Title: SeaWorld<br/>Section: SeaWorld Ohio sale, re-birth, and eventual transition<br/><br/>1.  Ohio sale, re-birth, and eventual transition.In February 2001, Anheuser-Busch sold the SeaWorld Ohio park to Six Flags, Inc., operators of neighboring ""Six Flags Ohio"" (Geauga Lake until the end of 1999, reverting to the ""Geauga Lake"" name in 2004).<br/>2. Upon completion of the sale, the two parks were combined in spring 2001 as the so-called ""mega-park"" ""Six Flags Worlds Of Adventure"", which boasted its ""Three parks in one"" uniqueness: a waterpark, an amusement park, and a wildlife animal park - all included in one price of admission.<br/>3. SeaWorld executives replied that their park had been sold because of the short season of the animal park, because of Northeastern Ohio's cold winter months, and also because they were not able to get the rights to build roller coasters like the other SeaWorld properties had been able to.In March 2004, Six Flags, Inc., announced that it had sold ""Six Flags Worlds of Adventure"" to Cedar Fair Entertainment Company, the operators of the Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio.<br/>4. Cedar Fair took the park back to its original ""Geauga Lake"" name, which had a history dating back to 1888.<br/>5. Since the Six Flags company retained ownership of the animals, the majority of the animal portion of the park, including all of the exhibits and animal stadiums, was either emptied or fenced off for the 2004 season.After a nearly season-long wait, the Cedar Fair company announced its plans for the non-operational side of the former SeaWorld Ohio/Six Flags Worlds of Adventure-Wildlife Side.<br/>6. That entire portion of the land would become an immense waterpark, named ""Wildwater Kingdom"", opening in two phases, with the first phase in 2005, followed by the second phase in 2006.<br/>7. This decision marked the end of the marine-life park permanently.All of the animal stadiums and buildings were next torn down or converted into other venues.<br/>8. Some of the SeaWorld property remained intact, albeit hidden or modified.<br/>9. What remained included the former seal and sea lion area, the Ski Stadium (to be used in a Lumberjack show in 2006), the Aquarium (to be used for unknown purposes), and two movie theater houses/simulators, once housing 3D/4D movies.<br/>10. The Ski Stadium was removed in off-season 2008 to make way for ""Coconut Cove"", a refreshment station/observation area.<br/>11. All of these, except for Wildwater Kingdom, closed in 2007.<br/>"
The_Dark_Knight_Rises-Abstract,"Category: Movies<br/>Title: The Dark Knight Rises<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. The Dark Knight Rises is a 2012 British-American epic superhero film directed by Christopher Nolan, who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan Nolan and the story with David S. Goyer.<br/>2. Featuring the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the final installment in Nolan's ""Batman"" film trilogy, and it is the sequel to ""Batman Begins"" (2005) and ""The Dark Knight"" (2008).<br/>3. Christian Bale reprises the lead role of Bruce Wayne/Batman, with a returning cast of his allies: Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth, Gary Oldman as James Gordon, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox.<br/>4. The film introduces Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), a sly, morally ambiguous cat burglar, and Bane (Tom Hardy), a mercenary bent on destroying Gotham City.<br/>5. Drawn back into action by new threats facing the city, an older Bruce Wayne is forced to come out of retirement and become Batman once again.Christopher Nolan was initially hesitant about returning to the series for a second time, but agreed to come back after developing a story with his brother and Goyer that he felt would conclude the series on a satisfactory note.<br/>6. Nolan drew inspiration from Bane's comic book debut in the 1993 """" storyline, the 1986 series ""The Dark Knight Returns"", and the 1999 storyline ""No Man's Land"".<br/>7. Filming took place in various locations, including Jodhpur, London, Nottingham, Glasgow, Los Angeles, New York City, Newark, and Pittsburgh.<br/>8. Nolan used IMAX cameras for much of the filming, including the first six minutes of the film, to optimize the quality of the picture.<br/>9. A variation of the Batplane termed ""The Bat"", an underground prison set, and a new Batcave set were created specifically for the film.<br/>10. As with ""The Dark Knight"", viral marketing campaigns began early during production to help promotion.<br/>11. When filming concluded, Warner Bros. refocused its campaign: developing promotional websites, releasing the first six minutes of the film, screening theatrical trailers, and sending out information regarding the film's plot.<br/>12. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" premiered in New York City on July 16, 2012.<br/>13. The film was released in Australia and New Zealand on July 19, 2012, and in North America and the United Kingdom on July 20, 2012.<br/>14. Upon release it received a favorable critical response and grossed over $1.081 billion worldwide.<br/>15. It is currently the ninth-highest-grossing film of all time, the third-highest-grossing film of 2012, and the third-highest-grossing superhero film of all time.<br/>"

Around April 1906 he met Pablo Picasso, who was 11 years younger than Matisse.<br/>2. The two became lifelong friends as well as rivals and are often compared; one key difference between them is that Matisse drew and painted from nature, while Picasso was much more inclined to work from imagination.<br/>3. The subjects painted most frequently by both artists were women and still life, with Matisse more likely to place his figures in fully realised interiors.<br/>4. Matisse and Picasso were first brought together at the Paris salon of Gertrude Stein and her companion Alice B. Toklas.<br/>5. During the first decade of the twentieth century, the Americans in Paris— Gertrude Stein, her brothers Leo Stein, Michael Stein and Michael's wife Sarah—were important collectors and supporters of Matisse's paintings.<br/>6. In addition Gertrude Stein's two American friends from Baltimore, the Cone sisters Claribel and Etta, became major patrons of Matisse and Picasso, collecting hundreds of their paintings and drawings.<br/>7. The Cone collection is now exhibited in the Baltimore Museum of Art.While numerous artists visited the Stein salon, many of these artists were not represented among the paintings on the walls at 27 rue de Fleurus.<br/>8. Where Renoir, Cézanne, Matisse, and Picasso's works dominated Leo and Gertrude Stein's collection, Sarah Stein's collection particularly emphasised Matisse.Contemporaries of Leo and Gertrude Stein, Matisse and Picasso became part of their social circle and routinely joined the gatherings that took place on Saturday evenings at 27 rue de Fleurus.<br/>9. Gertrude attributed the beginnings of the Saturday evening salons to Matisse, remarking:""More and more frequently, people began visiting to see the Matisse paintings—and the Cézannes: Matisse brought people, everybody brought somebody, and they came at any time and it began to be a nuisance, and it was in this way that Saturday evenings began.<br/>10. ""'Among Pablo Picasso's acquaintances who also frequented the Saturday evenings were: Fernande Olivier (Picasso's mistress), Georges Braque, André Derain, the poets Max Jacob and Guillaume Apollinaire, Marie Laurencin (Apollinaire's mistress and an artist in her own right), and Henri Rousseau.His friends organised and financed the ""Académie Matisse"" in Paris, a private and non-commercial school in which Matisse instructed young artists.<br/>11. It operated from 1907 until 1911.<br/>12. Hans Purrmann and Sarah Stein were amongst several of his most loyal students.Matisse spent seven months in Morocco from 1912 to 1913, producing about 24 paintings and numerous drawings.<br/>13. His frequent orientalist topics of later paintings, such as odalisques, can be traced to this period.<br/>"

Various cheeses, berries, seeds and other ingredients can also be added to green salads.<br/>3. Cheeses, in the form of cubes, crumbles, or grated, are often used, including blue cheese, Parmesan cheese, and feta cheese.<br/>4.

Six_Flags-Growth_and_acquisitions,"Category: Travel<br/>Title: Six Flags<br/>Section: Growth and acquisitions<br/><br/>1. The original park, in Arlington (between Dallas and Fort Worth) was sold in 1966 to a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad, which was actively pursuing non-railroad investments in an effort to diversify its sources of income.<br/>2. (In 1968, the Pennsylvania Railroad merged with the New York Central Railroad to form Penn Central Corp.) With the new owners came a more abundant supply of capital for geographic expansion and park additions.<br/>3. Six Flags opened Six Flags Over Georgia in 1967 and Six Flags Over Mid-America in 1971, which would, along with Six Flags Over Texas, be the only three parks that would be constructed by the company.The company continued to grow by acquiring independent parks.<br/>4. Six Flags purchased AstroWorld in Houston, Texas in 1975, Great Adventure in Jackson, New Jersey in 1977 and Magic Mountain in Valencia, California in 1979.<br/>5. These purchases were followed by Penn Central selling assets to Bally Manufacturing in 1982.In 1984, the Great America theme park in Gurnee, Illinois was acquired from the Marriott hotel chain.Also in 1984, as a result of its acquisition of Great America, Six Flags acquired the rights to Time Warner/Warner Bros.' ""Looney Tunes"" animated characters for use in Six Flags properties.<br/>6. Bally surrendered control of the chain to Wesray Capital Corporation in a 1987 leveraged buyout.<br/>7. Time Warner quickly began to gain more leverage in the company, gaining a 19.5% stake in Six Flags in 1990 and then 50% in 1991, with the remaining shares of the company being split by Blackstone Group and Wertheim Schroder & Company.<br/>8. Time Warner purchased the remaining stake in Six Flags in 1993, changing the company's name from ""Six Flags Corp"".<br/>9. to ""Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc"".In 1996, Six Flags began to manage Fiesta Texas theme park in San Antonio, Texas and purchased the park from USAA in 1998.<br/>"
Evolution-Genetic_hitchhiking,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Evolution<br/>Section: Genetic hitchhiking<br/><br/>1. Recombination allows alleles on the same strand of DNA to become separated.<br/>2. However, the rate of recombination is low (approximately two events per chromosome per generation).<br/>3. As a result, genes close together on a chromosome may not always be shuffled away from each other and genes that are close together tend to be inherited together, a phenomenon known as linkage.<br/>4. This tendency is measured by finding how often two alleles occur together on a single chromosome compared to expectations, which is called their linkage disequilibrium.<br/>5. A set of alleles that is usually inherited in a group is called a haplotype.<br/>6. This can be important when one allele in a particular haplotype is strongly beneficial: natural selection can drive a selective sweep that will also cause the other alleles in the haplotype to become more common in the population; this effect is called genetic hitchhiking or genetic draft.<br/>7. Genetic draft caused by the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection can be partially captured by an appropriate effective population size.<br/>"
French_fries-Variants,"Category: Food<br/>Title: French fries<br/>Section: Variants<br/><br/>1. Variants of French fries include ""thick-cut fries"", ""steak fries"", ""shoestring fries"", ""jojos"", ""crinkle fries"", ""curly fries"", ""hand-cut fries"" and ""tornado fries"".<br/>2. Fries cut into rough cubes instead of sticks are called ""home fries"".<br/>3. Fries cut thickly with the skin left on are called ""potato wedges"", and fries without the skin are called ""steak fries"", essentially the American equivalent of the British ""chip"".<br/>4. They can also be coated with breading, spices, or other ingredients, which include garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, paprika, and salt to create ""seasoned fries"", cheese to create ""cheese fries"", or chili to create ""chili fries"".<br/>5. Sometimes, French fries are cooked in the oven as a final step in the preparation (having been coated with oil during preparation at the factory): these are often sold frozen and are called ""oven fries"" or ""oven chips"".<br/>6. Some restaurants and groceries in North America offer French fries made from sweet potatoes instead of traditional white potatoes.In France, the thick-cut fries are called ""Pommes Pont-Neuf"" or simply ""pommes frites"", about 10 mm; thinner variants are ""pommes allumettes"" (matchstick potatoes), ±7 mm, and ""pommes paille"" (potato straws), 3–4 mm (roughly ⅜, ¼ and ⅛ inch respectively).<br/>7. The two-bath technique is standard (Bocuse).<br/>8. ""Pommes gaufrettes"" or ""waffle fries"" are not typical French fried potatoes, but actually crisps obtained by quarter-turning the potato before each next slide over a grater and deep-frying just once.<br/>9. This results in large flat fries with two layers, each of which consists of parallel strips of potato.In an interview, Burger King president Donald Smith said that his chain's fries are sprayed with a sugar solution shortly before being packaged and shipped to individual outlets.<br/>10. The sugar caramelizes in the cooking fat, producing the golden color customers expect.<br/>11. McDonald's was assumed to fry their fries for a total time of about 15 to 20 minutes, and with fries fried at least twice.<br/>"
Stem_cell-Identification,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Stem cell<br/>Section: Identification<br/><br/>1. In practice, stem cells are identified by whether they can regenerate tissue.<br/>2. For example, the defining test for bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is the ability to transplant the cells and save an individual without HSCs.<br/>3. This demonstrates that the cells can produce new blood cells over a long term.<br/>4. It should also be possible to isolate stem cells from the transplanted individual, which can themselves be transplanted into another individual without HSCs, demonstrating that the stem cell was able to self-renew.Properties of stem cells can be illustrated ""in vitro"", using methods such as clonogenic assays, in which single cells are assessed for their ability to differentiate and self-renew.<br/>5. Stem cells can also be isolated by their possession of a distinctive set of cell surface markers.<br/>6. However, ""in vitro"" culture conditions can alter the behavior of cells, making it unclear whether the cells will behave in a similar manner ""in vivo"".<br/>7. There is considerable debate as to whether some proposed adult cell populations are truly stem cells.<br/>"

Although small amounts of plutonium exist in nature, the best way to obtain large quantities of the element is in a nuclear reactor, in which natural uranium is bombarded by neutrons.<br/>3. The uranium-238 is transmuted into uranium-239, which rapidly decays, first into neptunium-239 and then into plutonium-239.<br/>4. Only a small amount of the uranium-238 will be transformed, so the plutonium must be chemically separated from the remaining uranium, from any initial impurities, and from fission products.<br/>"

Cake-Cake_decorating,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Cake<br/>Section: Cake decorating<br/><br/>1.  decorating.A finished cake is often enhanced by covering it with icing, or frosting, and toppings such as sprinkles, which are also known as ""jimmies"" in certain parts of the United States and ""hundreds and thousands"" in the United Kingdom.<br/>2. Frosting is usually made from powdered (icing) sugar, sometimes a fat of some sort, milk or cream, and often flavorings such as vanilla extract or cocoa powder.<br/>3. Some decorators use a rolled fondant icing.<br/>4. Commercial bakeries tend to use lard for the fat, and often whip the lard to introduce air bubbles.<br/>5. This makes the icing light and spreadable.<br/>6. Home bakers either use lard, butter, margarine or some combination thereof.<br/>7. Sprinkles are small firm pieces of sugar and oils that are colored with food coloring.<br/>8. In the late 20th century, new cake decorating products became available to the public.<br/>9. These include several specialized sprinkles and even methods to print pictures and transfer the image onto a cake.Special tools are needed for more complex cake decorating, such as piping bags or syringes, and various piping tips.<br/>10. To use a piping bag or syringe, a piping tip is attached to the bag or syringe using a coupler.<br/>11. The bag or syringe is partially filled with icing which is sometimes colored.<br/>12. Using different piping tips and various techniques, a cake decorator can make many different designs.<br/>13. Basic decorating tips include open star, closed star, basketweave, round, drop flower, leaf, multi, petal, and specialty tips.Royal icing, marzipan (or a less sweet version, known as almond paste), fondant icing(also known as sugarpaste) and buttercream are used as covering icings and to create decorations.<br/>14. Floral sugarcraft or wired sugar flowers are an important part of cake decoration.<br/>15. Cakes for special occasions, such as wedding cakes, are traditionally rich fruit cakes or occasionally Madeira cakes, that are covered with marzipan and iced using royal icing or sugar-paste.<br/>16. They are finished with piped borders (made with royal icing) and adorned with a piped message, wired sugar flowers, hand-formed fondant flowers, marzipan fruit, piped flowers, or crystallized fruits or flowers such as grapes or violets.<br/>"

Global_warming-Surveys_of_public_opinion,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Global warming<br/>Section: Surveys of public opinion<br/><br/>1. Researchers at the University of Michigan have found that the public's belief as to the causes of global warming depends on the wording choice used in the polls.In 2007–2008 Gallup Polls surveyed 127 countries.<br/>2. Over a third of the world's population was unaware of global warming, with people in developing countries less aware than those in developed, and those in Africa the least aware.<br/>3. Of those aware, Latin America leads in belief that temperature changes are a result of human activities while Africa, parts of Asia and the Middle East, and a few countries from the Former Soviet Union lead in the opposite belief.<br/>4. There is a significant contrast of the opinions of the concept and the appropriate response between Europe and the United States.<br/>5. Nick Pidgeon of Cardiff University said that ""results show the different stages of engagement about global warming on each side of the Atlantic"", adding, ""The debate in Europe is about what action needs to be taken, while many in the US still debate whether climate change is happening.""<br/>6. A 2010 poll by the Office of National Statistics found that 75% of UK respondents were at least ""fairly convinced"" that the world's climate is changing, compared to 87% in a similar survey in 2006.<br/>7. A January 2011 ICM poll in the UK found 83% of respondents viewed climate change as a current or imminent threat, while 14% said it was no threat.<br/>8. Opinion was unchanged from an August 2009 poll asking the same question, though there had been a slight polarisation of opposing views.By 2010, with 111 countries surveyed, Gallup determined that there was a substantial decrease in the number of Americans and Europeans who viewed global warming as a serious threat.<br/>9. In the US, a little over half the population (53%) now viewed it as a serious concern for either themselves or their families; this was 10% below the 2008 poll (63%).<br/>10. Latin America had the biggest rise in concern, with 73% saying global warming was a serious threat to their families.<br/>11. That global poll also found that people are more likely to attribute global warming to human activities than to natural causes, except in the USA where nearly half (47%) of the population attributed global warming to natural causes.A March–May 2013 survey by Pew Research Center for the People & the Press polled 39 countries about global threats.<br/>12. According to 54% of those questioned, global warming featured top of the perceived global threats.<br/>13. In a January 2013 survey, Pew found that 69% of Americans say there is solid evidence that the Earth's average temperature has been getting warmer over the past few decades, up six points since November 2011 and 12 points since 2009.<br/>"

Biology-Energy,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Biology<br/>Section: Energy<br/><br/>1. The survival of a living organism depends on the continuous input of energy.<br/>2. Chemical reactions that are responsible for its structure and function are tuned to extract energy from substances that act as its food and transform them to help form new cells and sustain them.<br/>3. In this process, molecules of chemical substances that constitute food play two roles; first, they contain energy that can be transformed for biological chemical reactions; second, they develop new molecular structures made up of biomolecules.The organisms responsible for the introduction of energy into an ecosystem are known as producers or autotrophs.<br/>4. Nearly all of these organisms originally draw energy from the sun.<br/>5. Plants and other phototrophs use solar energy via a process known as photosynthesis to convert raw materials into organic molecules, such as ATP, whose bonds can be broken to release energy.<br/>6. A few ecosystems, however, depend entirely on energy extracted by chemotrophs from methane, sulfides, or other non-luminal energy sources.Some of the captured energy is used to produce biomass to sustain life and provide energy for growth and development.<br/>7. The majority of the rest of this energy is lost as heat and waste molecules.<br/>8. The most important processes for converting the energy trapped in chemical substances into energy useful to sustain life are metabolism and cellular respiration.<br/>"

Boston_Tea_Party-Legacy,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Boston Tea Party<br/>Section: Legacy<br/><br/>1. John Adams and many other Americans considered tea drinking to be unpatriotic following the Boston Tea Party.<br/>2. Tea drinking declined during and after the Revolution, resulting in a lasting American preference for coffee.According to historian Alfred Young, the term ""Boston Tea Party"" did not appear in print until 1834.<br/>3. Before that time, the event was usually referred to as the ""destruction of the tea"".<br/>4. According to Young, American writers were for many years apparently reluctant to celebrate the destruction of property, and so the event was usually ignored in histories of the American Revolution.<br/>5. This began to change in the 1830s, however, especially with the publication of biographies of George Robert Twelves Hewes, one of the few still-living participants of the ""tea party"", as it then became known.The Boston Tea Party Museum is located on the Congress Street Bridge in Boston.<br/>6. It features reenactments, a documentary, and a number of interactive exhibits.<br/>7. The museum features two authentically restored ships, the Eleanor and the Beaver.<br/>8. Additionally, the museum possesses one of two known tea chests from the original event, part of its permanent collection.<br/>9. The issue was never the tax but how the tax was passed without American input; United States Congress taxed tea from 1789 to 1872.The Boston Tea Party has often been referenced in other political protests.<br/>10. When Mohandas K. Gandhi led a mass burning of Indian registration cards in South Africa in 1908, a British newspaper compared the event to the Boston Tea Party.<br/>11. When Gandhi met with the British viceroy in 1930 after the Indian salt protest campaign, Gandhi took some duty-free salt from his shawl and said, with a smile, that the salt was ""to remind us of the famous Boston Tea Party.<br/>12. ""American activists from a variety of political viewpoints have invoked the Tea Party as a symbol of protest.<br/>13. In 1973, on the 200th anniversary of the Tea Party, a mass meeting at Faneuil Hall called for the impeachment of President Richard Nixon and protested oil companies in the ongoing oil crisis.<br/>14. Afterwards, protesters boarded a replica ship in Boston Harbor, hanged Nixon in effigy, and dumped several empty oil drums into the harbor.<br/>15. In 1998, two conservative US Congressmen put the federal tax code into a chest marked ""tea"" and dumped it into the harbor.In 2006, a libertarian political party called the ""Boston Tea Party"" was founded.<br/>16. In 2007, the Ron Paul ""Tea Party"" money bomb, held on the 234th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party, broke the one-day fund-raising record by raising $6.04 million in 24 hours.<br/>17. Subsequently, these fund-raising ""Tea parties"" grew into the Tea Party movement, which dominated politics for the next two years, culminating in a voter victory for the Republicans in 2010 who were widely elected to seats in the United States House of Representatives.<br/>"
Indonesia-Abstract,"Category: Country<br/>Title: Indonesia<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. Indonesia ( or ), officially the Republic of Indonesia ( ), is a sovereign state in Southeast Asia and Oceania.<br/>2. Indonesia is an archipelago comprising 13,466 islands.<br/>3. It encompasses 33 provinces and 1 Special Administrative Region (for being governed by a pre-colonial monarchy) with over 238 million people, making it the world's fourth most populous country.<br/>4. Indonesia's republic form of government comprises an elected legislature and president.<br/>5. The nation's capital city is Jakarta.<br/>6. The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea, East Timor, and Malaysia.<br/>7. Other neighboring countries include Singapore, the Philippines, Australia, Palau, and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.<br/>8. Indonesia is a founding member of ASEAN and a member of the G-20 major economies.<br/>9. The Indonesian economy is the world's 16th largest by nominal GDP.The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the 7th century, when Srivijaya and then later Majapahit traded with China and India.<br/>10. Local rulers gradually absorbed foreign cultural, religious and political models from the early centuries CE, and Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished.<br/>11. Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources.<br/>12. Muslim traders brought the now-dominant Islam, while European powers brought Christianity and fought one another to monopolize trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Discovery.<br/>13. Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism, Indonesia secured its independence after World War II.<br/>14. Indonesia's history has since been turbulent, with challenges posed by natural disasters, corruption, separatism, a democratization process, and periods of rapid economic change.Indonesia consists of hundreds of distinct native ethnic and linguistic groups.<br/>15. The largest – and politically dominant – ethnic group are the Javanese.<br/>16. A shared identity has developed, defined by a national language, ethnic diversity, religious pluralism within a majority Muslim population, and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it.<br/>17. Indonesia's national motto, """"Bhinneka Tunggal Ika"""" (""Unity in Diversity"" ""literally,"" ""many, yet one""), articulates the diversity that shapes the country.<br/>18. Despite its large population and densely populated regions, Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world's second highest level of biodiversity.<br/>19. The country has abundant natural resources, yet poverty remains widespread.<br/>"

Marathon-Wheelchair_division,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Marathon<br/>Section: Wheelchair division<br/><br/>1. Many marathons feature a wheelchair division.<br/>2. Typically, those in the wheelchair racing division start their races earlier than their running counterparts.The first wheelchair marathon was in 1974 in Toledo, Ohio, won by Bob Hall in 2:54.<br/>3. Hall competed in the 1975 Boston Marathon and finished in 2:58, inaugurating the introduction of wheelchair divisions into the Boston Marathon.<br/>4. From 1977 the race was declared the US National Wheelchair championship.<br/>5. The Boston Marathon awards $10,000 to the winning push-rim athlete.<br/>6. Ernst van Dyk has won the Boston Marathon wheelchair division nine times and holds the world record at 1:18:27, set in Boston in 2004.<br/>7. Jean Driscoll won eight times (seven consecutively) and holds the women's world record at 1:34:22.The New York City Marathon banned wheelchair entrants in 1977, citing safety concerns, but then voluntarily allowed Bob Hall to compete after the state Division of Human Rights ordered the marathon to show cause.<br/>8. The Division ruled in 1979 that the New York City Marathon and New York Road Runners club had to allow wheelchair athletes to compete, and confirmed this at appeal in 1980, but the State Supreme Court ruled in 1981 that a ban on wheelchair racers was not discriminatory as the marathon was historically a foot race.<br/>9. However, by 1986 14 wheelchair athletes were competing, and an official wheelchair division was added to the marathon in 2000.<br/>"
World_War_II-Pacific_(1942–43),"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: World War II<br/>Section: Pacific (1942–43)<br/><br/>1. Pacific (1942–43).By the end of April 1942, Japan and its ally Thailand had almost fully conquered Burma, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, and Rabaul, inflicting severe losses on Allied troops and taking a large number of prisoners.<br/>2. Despite stubborn resistance at Corregidor, the US possession of the Philippines was eventually captured in May 1942, forcing its government into exile.<br/>3. On 16 April, in Burma 7,000 British soldiers were encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division during the Battle of Yenangyaung and rescued by the Chinese 38th Division.<br/>4. Japanese forces also achieved naval victories in the South China Sea, Java Sea and Indian Ocean, and bombed the Allied naval base at Darwin, Australia.<br/>5. The only real Allied success against Japan was a Chinese victory at Changsha in early January 1942.<br/>6. These easy victories over unprepared opponents left Japan overconfident, as well as overextended.In early May 1942, Japan initiated operations to capture Port Moresby by amphibious assault and thus sever communications and supply lines between the United States and Australia.<br/>7. The Allies, however, prevented the invasion by intercepting and defeating the Japanese naval forces in the Battle of the Coral Sea.<br/>8. Japan's next plan, motivated by the earlier Doolittle Raid, was to seize Midway Atoll and lure American carriers into battle to be eliminated; as a diversion, Japan would also send forces to occupy the Aleutian Islands in Alaska.<br/>9. In early June, Japan put its operations into action but the Americans, having broken Japanese naval codes in late May, were fully aware of the plans and force dispositions and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive victory at Midway over the Imperial Japanese Navy.With its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the Midway battle, Japan chose to focus on a belated attempt to capture Port Moresby by an overland campaign in the Territory of Papua.<br/>10. The Americans planned a counter-attack against Japanese positions in the southern Solomon Islands, primarily Guadalcanal, as a first step towards capturing Rabaul, the main Japanese base in Southeast Asia.Both plans started in July, but by mid-September, the Battle for Guadalcanal took priority for the Japanese, and troops in New Guinea were ordered to withdraw from the Port Moresby area to the northern part of the island, where they faced Australian and United States troops in the Battle of Buna-Gona.<br/>11. Guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with heavy commitments of troops and ships in the battle for Guadalcanal.<br/>12. By the start of 1943, the Japanese were defeated on the island and withdrew their troops.<br/>13. In Burma, Commonwealth forces mounted two operations.<br/>14. The first, an offensive into the Arakan region in late 1942, went disastrously, forcing a retreat back to India by May 1943.<br/>15. The second was the insertion of irregular forces behind Japanese front-lines in February which, by the end of April, had achieved mixed results.<br/>"

Machu_Picchu-Cultural_artifacts:_Dispute_between_Peru_and_Yale_University,"Category: Travel<br/>Title: Machu Picchu<br/>Section: Cultural artifacts: Dispute between Peru and Yale University<br/><br/>1. In 1912 and 1914–15, Bingham excavated treasures from Machu Picchu—ceramic vessels, silver statues, jewelry, and human bones—and took them from Peru to Yale University in the United States for further study, supposedly for a period of 18 months.<br/>2. Yale has retained the artifacts until now, under the argument that Peru did not have the infrastructure or proper conditions to take care of the pieces.Eliane Karp, an anthropologist who is married to the former Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo, accused Yale of profiting from Peru's cultural heritage by claiming title to thousands of pieces removed by Bingham.<br/>3. Many have been on display at Yale's Peabody Museum since their removal.<br/>4. Yale returned some of the artifacts to Peru, but the university kept the remainder, claiming its position was supported by federal case law involving Peruvian antiquities.On 19 September 2007, the ""Courant"" reported that Peru and Yale had reached an agreement regarding the requested return of the artifacts.<br/>5. The agreement includes sponsorship of a joint traveling exhibition and construction of a new museum and research center in Cusco about which Yale will advise Peruvian officials.<br/>6. Yale acknowledges Peru's title to all the excavated objects from Machu Picchu, but Yale will share rights with Peru in the research collection, part of which will remain at Yale as an object of continuing study.On 19 June 2008, National Geographic Society's vice-president Terry Garcia was quoted by the daily publication, ""La República"".<br/>7. ""We were part of this agreement.<br/>8. National Geographic was there, we know what was said, the objects were lent and should be returned.<br/>9. ""On 21 November 2010, Yale University agreed in principle to the return of the controversial artifacts to their original home in Peru.<br/>10. As of November 2012, the third and final batch of thousands of artifacts were delivered.La Casa Concha (The Shell House) located close to Cusco's colonial center will be the permanent site where the Yale University artifacts will be exhibited.<br/>11.

Turkey-The_Seljuks_and_the_Ottoman_Empire,"Category: Country<br/>Title: Turkey<br/>Section: The Seljuks and the Ottoman Empire<br/><br/>1. The ""House of Seljuk"" was a branch of the ""Kınık"" Oğuz Turks who resided on the periphery of the Muslim world, in the Yabghu Khaganate of the Oğuz confederacy, to the north of the Caspian and Aral Seas, in the 9th century.<br/>2. In the 10th century, the Seljuks started migrating from their ancestral homeland into Persia, which became the administrative core of the Great Seljuk Empire.In the latter half of the 11th century, the Seljuks began penetrating into the eastern regions of Anatolia.<br/>3. In 1071, the Seljuk Turks defeated the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert, starting Turkification of the area; the Turkish language and Islam were introduced to Anatolia and gradually spread over the region and the slow transition from a predominantly Christian and Greek-speaking Anatolia to a predominantly Muslim and Turkish-speaking one was underway.In 1243, the Seljuk armies were defeated by the Mongols, causing the Seljuk Empire's power to slowly disintegrate.<br/>4. In its wake, one of the Turkish principalities governed by Osman I would, over the next 200 years, evolve into the Ottoman Empire, expanding throughout Anatolia, the Balkans, the Levant and North Africa.<br/>5. In 1453, the Ottomans completed their conquest of the Byzantine Empire by capturing its capital, Constantinople.In 1514, Sultan Selim I (1512–1520) successfully expanded the Empire's southern and eastern borders by defeating Shah Ismail I of the Safavid dynasty in the Battle of Chaldiran.<br/>6. In 1517, Selim I expanded Ottoman rule into Algeria and Egypt, and created a naval presence in the Red Sea.<br/>7. Subsequently, a competition started between the Ottoman and Portuguese empires to become the dominant sea power in the Indian Ocean, with numerous naval battles in the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf.<br/>8. The Portuguese presence in the Indian Ocean was perceived as a threat for the Ottoman monopoly over the ancient trading routes between East Asia and Western Europe (later collectively named the Silk Road).<br/>9. This important monopoly was increasingly compromised following the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope by Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias in 1488, which had a considerable impact on the Ottoman economy.The Ottoman Empire's power and prestige peaked in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent.<br/>10. The empire was often at odds with the Holy Roman Empire in its steady advance towards Central Europe through the Balkans and the southern part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.<br/>11. At sea, the Ottoman Navy contended with several Holy Leagues (composed primarily of Habsburg Spain, the Republic of Genoa, the Republic of Venice, the Knights of St. John, the Papal States, the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the Duchy of Savoy) for control of the Mediterranean Sea.<br/>12. In the east, the Ottomans were occasionally at war with Safavid Persia over conflicts stemming from territorial disputes or religious differences between the 16th and 18th centuries.From the beginning of the 19th century onwards, the Ottoman Empire began to decline.<br/>13. As it gradually shrank in size, military power and wealth, many Balkan Muslims migrated to the Empire's heartland in Anatolia, along with the Circassians fleeing the Russian conquest of the Caucasus.<br/>14. The decline of the Ottoman Empire led to a rise in nationalist sentiment among the various subject peoples, leading to increased ethnic tensions which occasionally burst into violence, such as the Hamidian massacres.The Ottoman Empire entered World War I on the side of the Central Powers and was ultimately defeated.<br/>15. During the war, an estimated 1,500,000 Armenians were deported and exterminated in the Armenian Genocide.<br/>16. The Turkish government denies that there was an Armenian Genocide and claims that Armenians were only relocated from the eastern war zone.<br/>17. Large-scale massacres were also committed against the empire's other minority groups such as the Greeks and Assyrians.Following the Armistice of Mudros on 30 October 1918, the victorious Allied Powers sought to partition the Ottoman state through the 1920 Treaty of Sèvres.<br/>"
All_I_Want_for_Christmas_Is_You-Background_and_writing,"Category: Music<br/>Title: All I Want for Christmas Is You<br/>Section: Background and writing<br/><br/>1. After a string of commercially successful albums, Carey's label Columbia Records began exercising the idea of the singer releasing a Christmas album.<br/>2. They felt that up until that point, Carey had been viewed as a pop singer.<br/>3. With the record, Columbia intended to broaden Carey's target market, and have her perceived more as an entertainer, not just a singer.<br/>4. Having been brought up as Christian and always celebrating Christmas, she agreed to create a holiday-themed album.<br/>5. With Walter Afanasieff, Carey co-wrote ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" while recording the album in mid-1994.<br/>6. In an interview, Carey explained the inspiration behind the song:I'm a very festive person and I love the holidays.<br/>7. I've sung Christmas songs since I was a little girl.<br/>8. I used to go Christmas caroling.<br/>9. When it came to the album, we had to have a nice balance between standard Christian hymns and fun songs.<br/>10. It was definitely a priority for me to write at least a few new songs, but for the most part people really want to hear the standards at Christmas time, no matter how good a new song is.Ostensibly, the song was inspired by Carey's romantic sentiments toward her then-husband Tommy Mottola.<br/>11. After the album's release, many promotional singles were released; while other songs were sent to Christian airplay radio stations, ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" was sent to pop and Top 40 channels.<br/>12. Author Chris Nickson described the song as ""fun and mellow"", and he felt its uptempo beat contrasted with the album's strong religious theme, broadening the album's appeal to teenage audiences.<br/>"

Like the majority of the videos from the album ""American Idiot"", it was directed by Samuel Bayer.<br/>2. The video features Green Day's support guitarist, Jason White.<br/>3. This is the second time Jason White has appeared in a Green Day video, first appearing in ""When I Come Around"", ten years earlier but not as a band member.The video focuses on a very loving couple (played by Jamie Bell and Evan Rachel Wood).<br/>4. The boyfriend promises never to leave his girlfriend but they later argue when the boyfriend enlists in the United States Marine Corps.<br/>5. The boyfriend interprets his actions as a way to show her that he loves her so much that he would put his life on the line to keep her safe; the girlfriend, however, is heartbroken, as he broke his vow to never leave her, and terrified at the thought that he might die in battle.<br/>6. The video then shows the boyfriend in battle in Iraq being ambushed by insurgents.<br/>7. This scene is intercut with scenes of the girlfriend tearfully mourning in a quiet field.<br/>8. The video ends on this juxtaposition, emphasizing the pain and heartache of losing loved ones due to the war.This video adds to the ""American Idiot"" anti-war sentiment of the Iraq War.<br/>9. The song eventually became a tribute song to the victims of Hurricane Katrina, and sound bites were added from various news coverages to the song.<br/>10. A live version of the song, recorded on September 3, 2005, at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts was released soon after and dedicated to the hurricane's victims.<br/>11.

Working by night under a gas lamp, Van Gogh painted this work directly from nature.<br/>3.

The objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession of the basketball after a missed field goal or free throw, as it rebounds from the hoop or backboard.<br/>2. This plays a major role in the game, as most possessions end when a team misses a shot.<br/>3. There are two categories of rebounds: offensive rebounds, in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession, and defensive rebounds, in which the defending team gains possession of the loose ball.<br/>4. The majority of rebounds are defensive, as the team on defense tends to be in better position to recover missed shots.<br/>"
Human_swimming-Lessons,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Human swimming<br/>Section: Lessons<br/><br/>1. Children generally do not swim independently until 4 years of age.In Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Estonia and Finland, the curriculum for the fifth grade (fourth grade in Estonia) states that all children should learn how to swim as well as how to handle emergencies near water.<br/>2. Most commonly, children are expected to be able to swim – of which at least on their back – after first falling into deep water and getting their head under water.<br/>3. Even though about 95 percent of Swedish school children know how to swim, drowning remains the third most common cause of death among children.In both the Netherlands and Belgium swimming lessons under school time (""schoolzwemmen"", school swimming) are supported by the government.<br/>4. Most schools provide swimming lessons.<br/>5. There is a long tradition of swimming lessons in the Netherlands and Belgium, the Dutch translation for the breaststroke swimming style is even ""schoolslag"" (schoolstroke).<br/>6. The children learn a variant of the breaststroke, which is technically not entirely correct.<br/>7. In France, swimming is a compulsory part of the curriculum for primary schools.<br/>8. Children usually spend one semester per year learning swimming during CE1/CE2/CM1 (2nd, 3rd and 4th grade).<br/>9. In many places, swimming lessons are provided by local swimming pools, both those run by the local authority and by private leisure companies.<br/>10. Many schools also include swimming lessons into their Physical Education curricula, provided either in the schools' own pool, or in the nearest public pool.<br/>11. In the UK, the ""Top-ups scheme"" calls for school children who cannot swim by the age of 11 to receive intensive daily lessons.<br/>12. These children who have not reached Great Britain's National Curriculum standard of swimming 25 metres by the time they leave primary school will be given a half-hour lesson every day for two weeks during term-time.In Canada and Mexico there has been a call for swimming to be included in the public school curriculum.In USA there is the Infant Swimming Resource (ISR) initiative that provides lessons for infant children, to cope with emergency situation when they have fallen into water.<br/>13. They are learned how to roll-back-to-float (hold their breath underwater, to roll onto their back, to float unassisted, rest and breathe until help arrives).<br/>"
Nigeria-Civil_war_(1967-1970),"Category: Country<br/>Title: Nigeria<br/>Section: Civil war (1967-1970)<br/><br/>1. Civil war (1967-1970).The disequilibrium and perceived corruption of the electoral and political process led in 1966 to several back-to-back military coups.<br/>2. The first was in January and led by a collection of young leftists under Major Emmanuel Ifeajuna and Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu.<br/>3. It was partially successful; the coup plotters murdered Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Premier Ahmadu Bello of the Northern Region and Premier Ladoke Akintola of the Western Region.<br/>4. Despite this, they could not set up a central government.<br/>5. President Nwafor Orizu was then pressured to hand over government to the Nigeria Army, under the command of General JTU Aguyi-Ironsi.The coup was counter-acted by another successful plot, supported primarily by Northern military officers and Northerners who favoured the NPC, it was engineered by Northern officers, which allowed Lt Colonel Yakubu Gowon to become head of state.<br/>6. This sequence of events led to an increase in ethnic tension and violence.<br/>7. The Northern coup, motivated by ethnic and religious reasons, resulted in the deaths of many military officers and civilians, especially those of Igbo descent.The violence against the Igbo increased their desire for autonomy.<br/>8. By May 1967, the Eastern Region voted to declare independence as a state called the Republic of Biafra, under the leadership of Lt Colonel Emeka Ojukwu.<br/>9. The Nigerian Civil War began as the Nigerian (Western and Northern) side attacked Biafra (South-eastern) on 6 July 1967 at Garkem.<br/>10. The 30 month war, with a long siege of Biafra and its isolation from trade and supplies, ended in January 1970.<br/>11. Estimates of the number of dead in the former Eastern Region are between 1 and 3 million people, from warfare, disease, and starvation, during the 30-month civil war .France, Egypt, Soviet Union, Britain and others were deeply involved in the civil war behind the scenes.<br/>12. Britain and the Soviet Union were the main military backers of the Nigerian government while France and others helped the Biafrans.<br/>13. Nigeria also used Egyptian pilots for their air force.<br/>"
The_Scream-Sources_of_inspiration,"Category: Art<br/>Title: The Scream<br/>Section: Sources of inspiration<br/><br/>1. The original German title given to the work by Munch is ""Der Schrei der Natur"" (""The Scream of Nature"").<br/>2. The Norwegian word ""skrik"" usually is translated as ""scream"", but is cognate with the English ""shriek"".<br/>3. Occasionally, the painting also has been called ""The Cry"".In his diary in an entry headed, ""Nice 22 January 1892"", Munch described his inspiration for the image:This memory was later rendered by Munch as a poem, which he hand-painted onto the frame of the 1895 pastel version of the work:Among theories advanced to account for the reddish sky in the background is the artist's memory of the effects of the powerful volcanic eruption of Krakatoa, which deeply tinted sunset skies red in parts of the Western hemisphere for months during 1883 and 1884, about a decade before Munch painted ""The Scream"".<br/>4. This explanation has been disputed by scholars, who note that Munch was an expressive painter and was not primarily interested in literal renderings of what he had seen.<br/>5. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the proximity of both a slaughterhouse and a lunatic asylum to the site depicted in the painting may have offered some inspiration.<br/>6. The scene was identified as being the view from a road overlooking Oslo, the Oslofjord and Hovedøya, from the hill of Ekeberg.<br/>7. At the time of painting the work, Munch's manic depressive sister Laura Catherine was a patient at the asylum at the foot of Ekeberg.In 1978, the Munch scholar Robert Rosenblum suggested that the strange, sexless creature in the foreground of the painting was inspired by a Peruvian mummy, which Munch could have seen at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris.<br/>8. This mummy, which was buried in a fetal position with its hands alongside its face, also struck the imagination of Munch's friend Paul Gauguin: it stood as a model for the central figure in his painting, ""Human misery (Grape harvest at Arles)"" and for the old woman at the left in his painting, ""Where Do We Come From?<br/>9. What Are We?<br/>10. Where Are We Going?"".<br/>11. More recently, an Italian anthropologist speculated that Munch might have seen a mummy in Florence's Museum of Natural History, which bears an even more striking resemblance to the painting.The imagery of ""The Scream"" has been compared to that which an individual suffering from depersonalization disorder experiences, a feeling of distortion of the environment and one's self, and also facial pain.<br/>"

The_Shawshank_Redemption-Production,"Category: Movies<br/>Title: The Shawshank Redemption<br/>Section: Production<br/><br/>1. Darabont secured the film adaptation rights from author Stephen King after impressing the author with his short film adaptation of ""The Woman in the Room"" in 1983.<br/>2. Although the two had become friends and maintained a pen-pal relationship, Darabont did not work with him until four years later in 1987, when he optioned to adapt ""Shawshank"".<br/>3. This is one of the more famous Dollar Deals made by King with aspiring filmmakers.<br/>4. Darabont later directed ""The Green Mile"" (1999), which was based on another work about a prison by Stephen King, and then followed that up with an adaptation of King's novella ""The Mist"".Rob Reiner, who had previously adapted another King novella, ""The Body"", into the film ""Stand by Me"" (1986), offered $2.5 million in an attempt to write and direct ""Shawshank"".<br/>5. He planned to cast Tom Cruise in the part of Andy and Harrison Ford as Red.<br/>6. Darabont seriously considered and liked Reiner's vision, but he ultimately decided it was his ""chance to do something really great"" by directing the film himself.Though the film is set in Maine, the Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio, served as the fictional Shawshank Prison.<br/>7. Though a large portion of the prison was torn down after filming, the main administration building and two cell blocks remained; the site would be revisited later for filming parts of the film ""Air Force One"".<br/>8. Several of the interior shots of the specialized prison facilities, such as the admittance rooms and the warden's office, were shot in the reformatory.<br/>9. The interior of the boarding room used by Brooks and Red was located in the administration building, though exterior shots were made elsewhere.<br/>10. The prison site is a tourist attraction.<br/>11. Internal scenes in the prison cellblocks were actually filmed on a soundstage built inside the nearby shuttered Westinghouse factory.<br/>12. Downtown scenes were also filmed in Mansfield, as well as neighboring Ashland, Ohio.<br/>13. The oak tree under which Andy buries his letter to Red is located at , near Malabar Farm State Park, in Lucas, Ohio.<br/>14. The tree was heavily damaged by straight-line winds in a thunderstorm on July 29, 2011; officials are unsure if the tree will survive.The film was dedicated to Allen Greene, an agent and a close personal friend of the film's director, Frank Darabont.<br/>15.

Statue_of_Liberty-Abstract,"Category: Travel<br/>Title: Statue of Liberty<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. The Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World; French: ""La Liberté éclairant le monde"") is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in the middle of New York Harbor, in Manhattan, New York City.<br/>2. The statue, designed by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and dedicated on October 28, 1886, was a gift to the United States from the people of France.<br/>3. The statue is of a robed female figure representing Libertas, the Roman goddess of freedom, who bears a torch and a ""tabula ansata"" (a tablet evoking the law) upon which is inscribed the date of the American Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776.<br/>4. A broken chain lies at her feet.<br/>5. The statue is an icon of freedom and of the United States: a welcoming signal to immigrants arriving from abroad.Bartholdi was inspired by French law professor and politician Édouard René de Laboulaye, who is said to have commented in 1865 that any monument raised to American independence would properly be a joint project of the French and American peoples.<br/>6. Due to the troubled political situation in France, work on the statue did not commence until the early 1870s.<br/>7. In 1875, Laboulaye proposed that the French finance the statue and the Americans provide the site and build the pedestal.<br/>8. Bartholdi completed the head and the torch-bearing arm before the statue was fully designed, and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions.The torch-bearing arm was displayed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, in 1876, and in New York's Madison Square Park from 1876 to 1882.<br/>9. Fundraising proved difficult, especially for the Americans, and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened due to lack of funds.<br/>10. Publisher Joseph Pulitzer of the ""New York World"" started a drive for donations to complete the project that attracted more than 120,000 contributors, most of whom gave less than a dollar.<br/>11. The statue was constructed in France, shipped overseas in crates, and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called Bedloe's Island.<br/>12. The statue's completion was marked by New York's first ticker-tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland.The statue was administered by the United States Lighthouse Board until 1901 and then by the Department of War; since 1933 it has been maintained by the National Park Service.<br/>13. The statue was closed for renovation for much of 1938.<br/>14. In the early 1980s, it was found to have deteriorated to such an extent that a major restoration was required.<br/>15. While the statue was closed from 1984 to 1986, the torch and a large part of the internal structure were replaced.<br/>16. After the September 11 attacks in 2001, it was closed for reasons of safety and security; the pedestal reopened in 2004 and the statue in 2009, with limits on the number of visitors allowed to ascend to the crown.<br/>17. The statue, including the pedestal and base, was closed for a year until October 28, 2012, so that a secondary staircase and other safety features could be installed; Liberty Island remained open.<br/>18. However, one day after the reopening, Liberty Island closed due to the effects of Hurricane Sandy; the statue and island opened again on July 4, 2013.<br/>19. Public access to the balcony surrounding the torch has been barred for safety reasons since 1916.<br/>"

Mount_Rushmore-Geology,"Category: Travel<br/>Title: Mount Rushmore<br/>Section: Geology<br/><br/>1. Mount Rushmore is largely composed of granite.<br/>2. The memorial is carved on the northwest margin of the Harney Peak granite batholith in the Black Hills of South Dakota, so the geologic formations of the heart of the Black Hills region are also evident at Mount Rushmore.<br/>3. The batholith magma intruded into the pre-existing mica schist rocks during the Proterozoic, roughly 1.6 billion years ago.<br/>4. Coarse grained pegmatite dikes are associated with the granite intrusion of Harney Peak and are visibly lighter in color, thus explaining the light-colored streaks on the foreheads of the presidents.The Black Hills granites were exposed to erosion during the Neoproterozoic, but were later buried by sandstone and other sediments during the Cambrian.<br/>5. Remaining buried throughout the Paleozoic, they were re-exposed again during the Laramide orogeny around 70 million years ago.<br/>6. The Black Hills area was uplifted as an elongated geologic dome.<br/>7. Subsequent erosion stripped the granite of the overlying sediments and the softer adjacent schist.<br/>8. Some schist does remain and can be seen as the darker material just below the sculpture of Washington.The tallest mountain in the region is Harney Peak ().<br/>9. Borglum selected Mount Rushmore as the site for several reasons.<br/>10. The rock of the mountain is composed of smooth, fine-grained granite.<br/>11. The durable granite erodes only every 10,000 years, thus was more than sturdy enough to support the sculpture and its long-term exposure.<br/>12. The mountain's height of above sea level made it suitable, and because it faces the southeast, the workers also had the advantage of sunlight for most of the day.<br/>"

The lyrics are the words of a sinister, controlling character, who is watching ""every breath you take; every move you make"".Sting later said he was disconcerted by how many people think the song is more positive than it is.<br/>2. He insists it's about the obsession with a lost lover, and the jealousy and surveillance that follow.<br/>3. ""One couple told me 'Oh we love that song; it was the main song played at our wedding!'<br/>4. I thought, 'Well, good luck.'""<br/>5. When asked why he appears angry in the music video Sting told BBC Radio 2, ""I think the song is very, very sinister and ugly and people have actually misinterpreted it as being a gentle little love song, when it's quite the opposite.<br/>6. ""According to the ""Back to Mono"" box-set book, ""Every Breath You Take"" is influenced by a Gene Pitney song titled ""Every Breath I Take"".<br/>7. The song's structure is a variation on the Classical rondo form with its AABACABA structure, a form rarely found in modern popular music.The demo of the song was recorded in an eight track suite in North London's Utopia studios and featured Sting singing over a Hammond organ.<br/>8. While recording, Summers came up with a guitar part inspired by Béla Bartók that would later become a trademark lick, and played it straight through in one take.<br/>9. He was asked to put guitar onto a simple backing track of bass, drums, and a single vocal, with Sting offering no directive beyond ""make it your own.<br/>10. ""The recording process was fraught with difficulties as personal tensions between the band members, particularly Sting and Stewart Copeland, came to the fore.<br/>11. Producer Hugh Padgham claimed that by the time of the recording sessions, Sting and Copeland ""hated each other"", with verbal and physical fights in the studio common.<br/>12. The tensions almost led to the recording sessions being cancelled until a meeting involving the band and the group's manager, Miles Copeland (Stewart's brother), resulted in an agreement to continue.<br/>13. The drum track was largely created through separate overdubs of each percussive instrument, with the main backbeat created by simultaneously playing a snare and a gong drum.<br/>14. Keyboard parts were added from Roland guitar synthesisers, a Prophet-5 and an Oberheim synthesiser.<br/>15. The single-note piano in the middle eight was recommended by Padgham, inspired by similar work that he had done with the group XTC.<br/>"

In 1964, Northern Rhodesia became the independent state of Zambia.<br/>2. The following year, Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence.<br/>3. This was not recognized by Zambia, the United Kingdom or the vast majority of states and led to United Nations-mandated sanctions.<br/>4. In response to the emerging crisis, in 1966 Zambia restricted or stopped border crossings; it did not re-open the border completely until 1980.<br/>5. Guerilla warfare arose on the southern side of the Zambezi from 1972: the Rhodesian Bush War.<br/>6. Visitor numbers began to drop, particularly on the Rhodesian side.<br/>7. The war affected Zambia through military incursions, causing the latter to impose security measures including the stationing of soldiers to restrict access to the gorges and some parts of the falls.Zimbabwe's internationally recognised independence in 1980 brought comparative peace, and the 1980s witnessed renewed levels of tourism and the development of the region as a centre for adventure sports.<br/>8. Activities that gained popularity in the area include whitewater rafting in the gorges, bungee jumping from the bridge, game fishing, horse riding, kayaking, and flights over the falls.<br/>"
Louisiana_Purchase-Abstract,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Louisiana Purchase<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. The Louisiana Purchase ( ""Sale of Louisiana"") was the acquisition by the United States of America in 1803 of of France's claim to the territory of Louisiana.<br/>2. The U.S. paid 50 million francs ($11,250,000) plus cancellation of debts worth 18 million francs ($3,750,000), for a total sum of 15 million dollars (around 4 cents per acre) for the Louisiana territory ($ million in dollars, less than 42 cents per acre).<br/>3. The Louisiana territory encompassed all or part of 15 present U.S. states and two Canadian provinces.<br/>4. The land purchased contained all of present-day Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska; parts of Minnesota that were west of the Mississippi River; most of North Dakota; most of South Dakota; northeastern New Mexico; northern Texas; the portions of Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado east of the Continental Divide; Louisiana west of the Mississippi River, including the city of New Orleans; and small portions of land that would eventually become part of the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.France controlled this vast area from 1699 until 1762, the year it gave the territory to its ally Spain.<br/>5. Under Napoleon Bonaparte, France took back the territory in 1800 in the hope of building an empire in North America.<br/>6. A slave revolt in Haiti and an impending war with Britain, however, led France to abandon these plans and sell the entire territory to the United States, which had originally intended only to seek the purchase of New Orleans and its adjacent lands.The purchase of the territory of Louisiana took place during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson.<br/>7. At the time, the purchase faced domestic opposition because it was thought to be unconstitutional.<br/>8. Although he agreed that the U.S. Constitution did not contain provisions for acquiring territory, Jefferson decided to go ahead with the purchase anyway in order to remove France's presence in the region and to protect both U.S. trade access to the port of New Orleans and free passage on the Mississippi River.<br/>"

Marshall considers it is the minor vi (Em) chord (the third chord in the I-V7-vi (G-D7-Em) progression).<br/>4. Everett is of the same opinion.<br/>5. Pedler claims, however, that more surprising is the melody note drop from B to F# against a III7 (B7) chord on ""understand"".<br/>6.

DNA-History_and_anthropology,"Category: Science<br/>Title: DNA<br/>Section: History and anthropology<br/><br/>1. Because DNA collects mutations over time, which are then inherited, it contains historical information, and, by comparing DNA sequences, geneticists can infer the evolutionary history of organisms, their phylogeny.<br/>2. This field of phylogenetics is a powerful tool in evolutionary biology.<br/>3. If DNA sequences within a species are compared, population geneticists can learn the history of particular populations.<br/>4. This can be used in studies ranging from ecological genetics to anthropology; For example, DNA evidence is being used to try to identify the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.DNA has also been used to look at modern family relationships, such as establishing family relationships between the descendants of Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson.<br/>5. This usage is closely related to the use of DNA in criminal investigations detailed above.<br/>6.

Periodic_table-Metallic_character,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Periodic table<br/>Section: Metallic character<br/><br/>1. The lower the values of ionization energy, electronegativity and electron affinity, the more metallic character the element has.<br/>2. Conversely, nonmetallic character increases with higher values of these properties.<br/>3. Given the periodic trends of these three properties, metallic character tends to decrease going across a period (or row) and, with some irregularities (mostly) due to poor screening of the nucleus by d and f electrons, and relativistic effects, tends to increase going down a group (or column or family).<br/>4. Thus, the most metallic elements (such as caesium and francium) are found at the bottom left of traditional periodic tables and the most nonmetallic elements (oxygen, fluorine, chlorine) at the top right.<br/>5. The combination of horizontal and vertical trends in metallic character explains the stair-shaped dividing line between metals and nonmetals found on some periodic tables, and the practice of sometimes categorizing several elements adjacent to that line, or elements adjacent to those elements, as metalloids.<br/>"

American_Gothic-Parodies,"Category: Art<br/>Title: American Gothic<br/>Section: Parodies<br/><br/>1. The Depression-era understanding of the painting as a depiction of an authentically American scene prompted the first well-known parody, a 1942 photo by Gordon Parks of cleaning woman Ella Watson, shot in Washington, D.C.""American Gothic"" is one of the few paintings to achieve iconic cultural status, along with Leonardo da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa"" and Edvard Munch's ""The Scream"".<br/>2. It is thus one of the most reproduced – and parodied – images ever made.<br/>3. Many artists have replaced the two people with other known couples and replaced the house with well-known houses.References and parodies of the image have been numerous for generations, appearing regularly in such media as postcards, magazines, animated cartoons, advertisements, comic books, album covers, television shows and other artists.<br/>4. The opening credits of the 1965 television show ""Green Acres"" had the main couple in an American Gothic-style pose; cinematic posters of the films ""For Richer or Poorer"", ""Son In Law"", ""American Gothic"", and ""Good Fences"" parody the painting.<br/>5. It is also a key motif in Anthony Weigh's play ""2,000 Feet Away"", which opens with a scene featuring the painting at the Art Institute.<br/>6. The painting was also parodied in a classic commercial for ""New Country Corn Flakes"", a General Mills product.A sculpture entitled ""God Bless America"" by sculptor John Seward Johnson II that features the ""American Gothic"" couple went on display in Chicago, Illinois, just south of the Tribune Tower on the Magnificent Mile of Michigan Avenue, in December 2008 but has been removed as of February 26, 2010.<br/>7. The sculpture was displayed in Dubuque, Iowa at the Figge Art Museum and is now on the campus of Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa until at least December 31, 2013.<br/>8. Postcards mimicking the couple with sitting US Presidents, Presidential nominees, and their spouses are popular commercial products.<br/>9. Ohio State Buckeyes football games feature the painting on their scoreboard; within a few seconds of its display, the man's eyes bug out and his tongue wags.A 1963 ""Saturday Evening Post"" cover featured the cast of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" in a parody of American Gothic with ""Irene Ryan"" and ""Buddy Ebsen"" posing like the 2 people in the painting flanked by ""Max Baer"" and ""Donna Douglas"" at their sides.David Ackles borrowed the title for his 1973 ""American Gothic"" album, as did The Smashing Pumpkins for their 2008 EP ""American Gothic"" and a 1995 television horror series created by Shaun Cassidy.<br/>10. Elton John and RuPaul portray the couple on the video for a rerecording of ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"" released in 1994.<br/>11. Astrovamps parodied the painting on the cover of their album, ""American Gothik"".<br/>12. The Ma and Pa couple at the beginning of the ""Doctor Who"" episode ""Gridlock"" are fashioned in the style of the couple in the painting.<br/>13. The ""American Gothic"" couple have even been reinterpreted as Living Dead Dolls twice, in 2004 and 2009.<br/>14. In the opening scene of ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"", Richard O'Brien and Patricia Quinn appear as a farmer and his wife in parody of ""American Gothic"".<br/>15. They are joined by a daughter dressed in the same fashion.<br/>16. The painting is also seen on the wall in the castle during the song ""Time Warp"" as well as it is seen in the sequel ""Shock Treatment""In the episode of ""The Simpsons"", ""Bart Gets an Elephant"", the Simpsons are revealed to evidently have the original ""American Gothic"" painting hanging on their living room wall.<br/>17. Bart unwittingly scrubs it while cleaning the house, and rubs off all the paint.<br/>18. Underneath, it reads ""If you can read this, you scrubbed too hard.<br/>19. Signed, Grant Wood.<br/>20. ""In the scene where Mulan's ancestors awaken Mushu in ""Mulan"", two of the ancestors appear as a parody of the farmer and his daughter, representing traditional values.The painting and its process of creation was parodied in a ""Saturday Night Live"" episode, which aired November 10, 2012, with host Anne Hathaway as Nan Wood Graham, Jason Sudeikis as Dr. Byron McKeeby, Tarran Killam as Grant Wood, and Kenan Thompson as a tour guide at The Art Institute of Chicago.<br/>"
Life_Is_Beautiful-Abstract,"Category: Movies<br/>Title: Life Is Beautiful<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. Life Is Beautiful () is a 1997 Italian comedy-drama film directed by and starring Roberto Benigni.<br/>2. Benigni plays Guido Orefice, a Jewish Italian book shop owner, who must employ his fertile imagination to shield his son from the horrors of internment in a Nazi concentration camp.<br/>3. Part of the film came from Benigni's own family history; before Roberto's birth, his father had survived three years of internment at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.<br/>4. The film was a critical and financial success, winning Benigni the Academy Award for Best Actor at the 71st Academy Awards as well as the Academy Award for Best Original Dramatic Score and the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.<br/>"
Popcorn-Nutritional_value,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Popcorn<br/>Section: Nutritional value<br/><br/>1. Air-popped popcorn is naturally high in dietary fiber and antioxidants, low in calories and fat, and free of sugar and sodium.<br/>2. This can make it an attractive snack to people with dietary restrictions on the intake of calories, fat, and/or sodium.<br/>3. For the sake of flavor, however, large amounts of fat, sugar, and sodium are often added to prepared popcorn, which can quickly convert it to a very poor choice for those on restricted diets.One particularly notorious example of this first came to public attention in the mid-1990s, when the Center for Science in the Public Interest produced a report about ""Movie Popcorn"", which became the subject of a widespread publicity campaign.<br/>4. The movie theaters surveyed used coconut oil to pop the corn, and then topped it with butter or margarine.<br/>5. ""A medium-size buttered popcorn"", the report said, ""contains more fat than a breakfast of bacon and eggs, a Big Mac and fries, and a steak dinner combined.""<br/>6. The practice continues today.<br/>7. For example, according to DietFacts.com, a small popcorn from Regal Cinema Group (the largest theater chain in the United States) still contains 29 g of saturated fat.<br/>8. the equivalent of a full day-and-a-half's reference daily intake.<br/>"
Udon-Origin,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Udon<br/>Section: Origin<br/><br/>1. There are many stories explaining the origin of udon.One story says that in AD.1241, Enni, a Rinzai monk, introduced flour milling technology to Japan.<br/>2. Floured crops were then made into noodles such as udon, soba, and pancakes which were eaten by locals.<br/>3. Milling techniques were spread around the country.In the Edo period, the thicker wheat noodle was generally called udon, and served with a hot broth called nurumugi(温麦).<br/>4. The chilled variety was called hiyamugi(冷麦).Another story states that in Nara period, a Japanese envoy was introduced to 14 kinds of confection whilst in Tang Dynasty China.<br/>5. One of them was called sakubei(索餅).<br/>6. Sakubei was listed as 'muginawa'(牟義縄) on Shin Senji Kyo(新撰字鏡), a dictionary which was published in Heian Era.<br/>7. The muginawa is believed to be an origin for many kinds of Japanese noodles.<br/>8. However, the muginawa listed on Shin Senji Kyo(新撰字鏡) was made with wheat and rice flour.Another historical story for udon claims that the original name of the noodle was 'konton', which was made with wheat flour and sweet fillings.Yet another story says that a Buddhist priest called Kukai introduced udon noodles to Shikoku during the Heian Era.In China, similar thick wheat flour noodles are called ""cū miàn"" (粗麵).<br/>9. This noodle was 2 to 3 mm in diameter, a flat pancake-shaped ""noodle"" added to miso-based soup.<br/>10. The Sino-Japanese characters for udon (饂飩) is similar to, but different from, the modern Chinese characters for wonton, which is called hún dùn in Mandarin (馄炖), a type of dumplings.In Chinese, udon noodles are called ""wūdōngmiàn"" (烏冬 ""wūdōng"" or 烏冬麵), and sometimes ""wūlóngmiàn"" (烏龍麵), which has the same characters as those used in ""Oolong"" tea (""wūlóngchá"", 烏龍茶), though there is no semantic relation between the two usages.Kūkai, the Buddhist priest, traveled to China around the beginning of the 9th century to study.<br/>11. Sanuki Province claimed to have been the first to adopt udon noodles from Kūkai.<br/>12. Hakata claimed to have produced udon noodles based on Enni's recipe.<br/>"
Juice-Health_benefits,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Juice<br/>Section: Health benefits<br/><br/>1. Juices are often consumed for their perceived health benefits.<br/>2. For example, orange juice is rich in vitamin C, folic acid, potassium, is an excellent source of bioavailable antioxidant phytochemicals and significantly improves blood lipid profiles in people affected with hypercholesterolemia.<br/>3. Prune juice is associated with a digestive health benefit.<br/>4. Cranberry juice has long been known to help prevent or even treat bladder infections, and it is now known that a substance in cranberries prevents bacteria from binding to the bladder.Many fruit juices have a higher sugar (fructose) content than sweetened soft drinks; e.g., typical grape juice has 50% more sugar than Coca-Cola.<br/>5. While soft drinks (e.g.<br/>6. Coca-Cola) cause oxidative stress when ingested and may even lead to insulin resistance in the long term, the same thing cannot be attributed to fruit juices.<br/>7. On the contrary, fruit juices are actually known for their ability to raise serum antioxidant capacity and even offset the oxidative stress and inflammation normally caused by high-fat and high-sugar meals.Fruit juice consumption overall in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and the US has increased in recent years, probably due to public perception of juices as a healthy natural source of nutrients and increased public interest in health issues.<br/>8. Indeed, fruit juice intake has been consistently associated with reduced risk of many cancer types, might be protective against stroke and delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease.The perception of commercial fruit juice as equal in health benefit to fresh fruit has been questioned, mainly because it lacks fiber and has often been highly processed.<br/>9. High-fructose corn syrup, an ingredient of many juice cocktails, has been linked to the increased incidence of type II diabetes.<br/>10. High consumption of juice is also linked to weight gain in some studies, but not in others.<br/>11. In a controlled clinical study, regular consumption of grape juice for 12 weeks did not cause any weight gain in volunteers, but consumption of a soft drink did.<br/>12. Fruit juice in moderate amounts can help children and adults meet daily recommendations for fruit consumption, nutrient intake and calories.The American Academy of Pediatrics says that fruit juice should not be given to infants before 6 months of age.<br/>13. For children ages 1 to 6, intake of fruit juice should be limited to 4 to 6 ounces per day (about a half to three-quarters of a cup).<br/>14. Giving children excessive juice can lead to poor nutrition, diarrhea, gas, abdominal pain, bloating, and tooth decay.<br/>"

Dalí also produced various lithographs and sculptures on the theme of soft watches late in his career.<br/>3. Some of these sculptures are the ""Persistence of Memory"", the ""Nobility of Time"", the ""Profile of Time"" and the ""Three Dancing Watches"".<br/>"
Yogurt-Beverages,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Yogurt<br/>Section: Beverages<br/><br/>1.

It is usually served with kacchi biryani at weddings and special feasts.<br/>6. Key ingredients are yogurt blended with mint leaves (mentha), mustard seeds and black rock salt (Kala Namak).<br/>7. Ground roasted cumin, ground white pepper, green chili pepper paste and sugar are often added.Lassi (Hindi: लस्सी, Urdu: لسی) is a yogurt-based beverage originally from the Indian subcontinent that is usually slightly salty or sweet.<br/>8. Lassi is a staple in Punjab.<br/>9. In some parts of the subcontinent, the sweet version may be commercially flavored with rosewater, mango or other fruit juice to create a very different drink.<br/>10. Salty lassi is usually flavored with ground, roasted cumin and red chilies; this salty variation may also use buttermilk, and in India is interchangeably called ""ghol"" (Bengal), ""mattha"" (North India), ""majjige"" (Karnataka), ""majjiga"" (Andhra Pradesh), ""moru"" (Tamil Nadu and Kerala), ""Dahi paani"" (Odisha), ""tak"" (Maharashtra), or ""chaas"" (Gujarat).<br/>11. Lassi is very widely drunk in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.<br/>12. Mango Lassi is a popular drink at Indian restaurants in US.In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia, an unsweetened and unsalted yogurt drink usually called simply ""jogurt"" is a popular accompaniment to ""burek"" and other bakery products.Sweetened yogurt drinks are the usual form in Europe (including the UK) and the US, containing fruit and added sweeteners.<br/>13. These are typically called ""drinking / drinkable yogurt"", such as Yop and BioBest Smoothie.Also available are ""yogurt smoothies"", which contain a higher proportion of fruit and are more like smoothies.<br/>14. In Ecuador, yogurt smoothies flavored with native fruit are served with pan de yuca as a common type of fast food.Also in Turkey, yogurt-soup or ""Yayla Çorbası"" is a popular way of consuming yogurt.<br/>15. The soup is a mix of yogurt, rice, flour and dried mint.<br/>"

The acrimony that began during the recording of the previous year's ""White Album"" resumed soon after the rehearsals began.<br/>3. The Beatles were not getting along, and Lennon and McCartney weren't working together as before.<br/>4. McCartney assumed the role of the leader, while a laid back Lennon was more interested in spending time/making music with his soon-to-be wife Yoko Ono, who was now present in the studio with him at all times.<br/>5. All of the factors led to friction within the band.<br/>6. At one point, Harrison walked out and quit the group after several arguments with McCartney and a severe fall-out with Lennon, due to the former's perfectionism and the latter's growing lack of interest in the band.<br/>7. Harrison was eventually coaxed back a few days later.<br/>8. The film version is famous for showcasing a number of conflicts between the group members and has frequently been referred to as a documentary intended to show the making of an album but instead showing ""the break-up of a band"".<br/>"

A few examples of films include ""It Happened at the World's Fair"" (1962), where it was used as a filming location, and ""Sleepless in Seattle"" (1993).<br/>3. In the 1974 film ""The Parallax View"", the inside and outside platforms of the observation deck are the setting for a political assassination, and there's a brief chase on the roof above it.<br/>4.
