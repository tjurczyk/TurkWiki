Canada-Foreign_relations_and_military,"Category: Country<br/>Title: Canada<br/>Section: Foreign relations and military<br/><br/>1. Canada currently employs a professional, volunteer military force of 68,250 active personnel and approximately 47,081 reserve personnel.<br/>2. The unified Canadian Forces (CF) comprise the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Navy, and Royal Canadian Air Force.<br/>3. In 2011, Canada's military expenditure totalled approximately C$24.5 billion.Canada and the United States share the world's longest undefended border, co-operate on military campaigns and exercises, and are each other's largest trading partner.<br/>4. Canada nevertheless has an independent foreign policy, most notably maintaining full relations with Cuba and declining to officially participate in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.<br/>5. Canada also maintains historic ties to the United Kingdom and France and to other former British and French colonies through Canada's membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and the Francophonie.<br/>6. Canada is noted for having a positive relationship with the Netherlands, owing, in part, to its contribution to the Dutch liberation during World War II.Canada's strong attachment to the British Empire and Commonwealth led to major participation in British military efforts in the Second Boer War, World War I and World War II.<br/>7. Since then, Canada has been an advocate for multilateralism, making efforts to resolve global issues in collaboration with other nations.<br/>8. Canada was a founding member of the United Nations in 1945 and of NATO in 1949.<br/>9. During the Cold War, Canada was a major contributor to UN forces in the Korean War and founded the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) in co-operation with the United States to defend against potential aerial attacks from the Soviet Union.During the Suez Crisis of 1956, future Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson eased tensions by proposing the inception of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, for which he was awarded the 1957 Nobel Peace Prize.<br/>10. As this was the first UN peacekeeping mission, Pearson is often credited as the inventor of the concept.<br/>11. Canada has since served in 50 peacekeeping missions, including every UN peacekeeping effort until 1989, and has since maintained forces in international missions in Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, and elsewhere; Canada has sometimes faced controversy over its involvement in foreign countries, notably in the 1993 Somalia Affair.Canada joined the Organization of American States (OAS) in 1990 and hosted the OAS General Assembly in Windsor, Ontario, in June 2000 and the third Summit of the Americas in Quebec City in April 2001.<br/>12. Canada seeks to expand its ties to Pacific Rim economies through membership in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC).In 2001, Canada deployed troops to Afghanistan as part of the US stabilization force and the UN-authorized, NATO-led International Security Assistance Force.<br/>13. In all, Canada lost 158 soldiers, one diplomat, two aid workers, and one journalist during the ten year mission, which cost approximately C$11.3 billion.In February 2007, Canada, Italy, the United Kingdom, Norway, and Russia announced their joint commitment to a $1.5-billion project to help develop vaccines for developing nations, and called on other countries to join them.<br/>14. In August 2007, Canada's territorial claims in the Arctic were challenged after a Russian underwater expedition to the North Pole; Canada has considered that area to be sovereign territory since 1925.<br/>15. Between March and October 2011, Canadian forces participated in a UN-mandated NATO intervention into the 2011 Libyan civil war.<br/>"
The_Holocaust-Persons_of_color,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: The Holocaust<br/>Section: Persons of color<br/><br/>1. The number of black people in Germany when the Nazis came to power is variously estimated at 5,000–25,000.<br/>2. It is not clear whether these figures included Asians.<br/>3. According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington, D.C., ""The fate of black people from 1933 to 1945 in Nazi Germany and in German-occupied territories ranged from isolation to persecution, sterilization, medical experimentation, incarceration, brutality, and murder.<br/>4. However, there was no systematic program for their elimination as there was for Jews and other groups.""<br/>5. Meanwhile, Afrikaaners, Berbers, Iranians and Pre-Partition Indians were classified as Aryans, so not persecuted (see main article).<br/>6. Racial restrictions were relaxed to the extent that Turkic peoples, Arabs and South Asians were recruited by the German military due to the shortage of manpower.<br/>"
England-Education,"Category: Country<br/>Title: England<br/>Section: Education<br/><br/>1. The Department for Education is the government department responsible for issues affecting people in England up to the age of 19, including education.<br/>2. State-run and -funded schools are attended by approximately 93% of English schoolchildren.<br/>3. Of these, a minority are faith schools, primarily Church of England or Catholic.<br/>4. Between three and four is nursery school, 4 and 11 is primary school, and 11 to 16 is secondary school.<br/>5. After finishing compulsory education, pupils take a GCSE examination, following which they may decide to continue in further education for two years.<br/>6. Further education colleges, such as sixth form colleges are either separate or attached to the secondary school institution and prepare students to sit A-Level examinations, for higher education at universities.Although most English secondary schools are comprehensive, in some areas there are selective intake grammar schools, to which entrance is subject to passing the eleven plus exam.<br/>7. Around 7.2% of English schoolchildren attend private schools, which are funded by private sources.<br/>8. Standards in state schools are monitored by the Office for Standards in Education, and in private schools by the Independent Schools Inspectorate.Students normally enter universities in the United Kingdom from 18 onwards, where they study for an academic degree.<br/>9. There are over 90 universities in England, all but one of which are public.<br/>10. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is the government department responsible for higher education in England.<br/>11. Students are generally entitled to student loans for maintenance.<br/>12. The first degree offered to undergraduates is the Bachelor's degree, which usually takes three years to complete.<br/>13. Students are then eligible for a postgraduate degree, a Master's degree, taking one year, or a Doctorate degree, which takes three.England's universities include some of the highest-ranked universities in the world; the University of Cambridge, Imperial College London, the University of Oxford and University College London are all ranked in the global top 10 in the 2010 ""QS World University Rankings"".<br/>14. The London School of Economics has been described as the world's leading social science institution for both teaching and research.<br/>15. The London Business School is considered one of the world's leading business schools and in 2010 its MBA programme was ranked best in the world by the ""Financial Times"".<br/>16. Academic degrees in England are usually split into classes: first class (I), upper second class (II:1), lower second class (II:2) and third (III), and unclassified (below third class).The King's School, Canterbury and King's School, Rochester are the oldest schools in the English-speaking world.<br/>17. Many of England's better-known schools, such as Winchester College, Eton College, St Paul's School, Rugby School, and Harrow School are fee-paying institutions.<br/>"
Stonehenge-Setting_and_access,"Category: Travel<br/>Title: Stonehenge<br/>Section: Setting and access<br/><br/>1. When Stonehenge was first opened to the public it was possible to walk among and even climb on the stones, but the stones were roped off in 1977 as a result of serious erosion.<br/>2. Visitors are no longer permitted to touch the stones, but are able to walk around the monument from a short distance away.<br/>3. English Heritage does, however, permit access during the summer and winter solstice, and the spring and autumn equinox.<br/>4. Additionally, visitors can make special bookings to access the stones throughout the year.The access situation and the proximity of the two roads has drawn widespread criticism, highlighted by a 2006 National Geographic survey.<br/>5. In the survey of conditions at 94 leading World Heritage Sites, 400 conservation and tourism experts ranked Stonehenge 75th in the list of destinations, declaring it to be ""in moderate trouble"".As motorised traffic increased, the setting of the monument began to be affected by the proximity of the two roads on either side – the A344 to Shrewton on the north side, and the A303 to Winterbourne Stoke to the south.<br/>6. Plans to upgrade the A303 and close the A344 to restore the vista from the stones have been considered since the monument became a World Heritage Site.<br/>7. However, the controversy surrounding expensive re-routing of the roads has led to the scheme being cancelled on multiple occasions.<br/>8. On 6 December 2007, it was announced that extensive plans to build Stonehenge road tunnel under the landscape and create a permanent visitors' centre had been cancelled.On 13 May 2009, the government gave approval for a £25 million scheme to create a smaller visitors' centre and close the A344, although this was dependent on funding and local authority planning consent.<br/>9. On 20 January 2010 Wiltshire Council granted planning permission for a centre to the west and English Heritage confirmed that funds to build it would be available, supported by a £10m grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund.<br/>10. On 23 June 2013 the A344 was closed to begin the work of removing the section of road and grassing it over.<br/>11. The centre, designed by Denton Corker Marshall, opened to the public on 18 December 2013.<br/>"
Yellowstone_National_Park-Flora,"Category: Travel<br/>Title: Yellowstone National Park<br/>Section: Flora<br/><br/>1. Over 1,700 species of trees and other vascular plants are native to the park.<br/>2. Another 170 species are considered to be exotic species and are non-native.<br/>3. Of the eight conifer tree species documented, Lodgepole Pine forests cover 80% of the total forested areas.<br/>4. Other conifers, such as Subalpine Fir, Engelmann Spruce, Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and Whitebark Pine, are found in scattered groves throughout the park.<br/>5. As of 2007, the whitebark pine is threatened by a fungus known as white pine blister rust; however, this is mostly confined to forests well to the north and west.<br/>6. In Yellowstone, about seven percent of the whitebark pine species have been impacted with the fungus, compared to nearly complete infestations in northwestern Montana.<br/>7. Quaking Aspen and willows are the most common species of deciduous trees.<br/>8. The aspen forests have declined significantly since the early 20th century, but scientists at Oregon State University attribute recent recovery of the aspen to the reintroduction of wolves which has changed the grazing habits of local elk.There are dozens of species of flowering plants that have been identified, most of which bloom between the months of May and September.<br/>9. The Yellowstone Sand Verbena is a rare flowering plant found only in Yellowstone.<br/>10. It is closely related to species usually found in much warmer climates, making the sand verbena an enigma.<br/>11. The estimated 8,000 examples of this rare flowering plant all make their home in the sandy soils on the shores of Yellowstone Lake, well above the waterline.In Yellowstone's hot waters, bacteria form mats of bizarre shapes consisting of trillions of individuals.<br/>12. These bacteria are some of the most primitive life forms on earth.<br/>13. Flies and other arthropods live on the mats, even in the middle of the bitterly cold winters.<br/>14. Initially, scientists thought that microbes there gained sustenance only from sulfur.<br/>15. In 2005 researchers from the University of Colorado at Boulder discovered that the sustenance for at least some of the diverse hyperthermophilic species is molecular hydrogen.<br/>16. ""Thermus aquaticus"" is a bacterium found in the Yellowstone hot springs that produces an important enzyme (Taq polymerase) that is easily replicated in the lab and is useful in replicating DNA as part of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process.<br/>17. The retrieval of these bacteria can be achieved with no impact to the ecosystem.<br/>18. Other bacteria in the Yellowstone hot springs may also prove useful to scientists who are searching for cures for various diseases.Non-native plants sometimes threaten native species by using up nutrient resources.<br/>19. Though exotic species are most commonly found in areas with the greatest human visitation, such as near roads and at major tourist areas, they have also spread into the backcountry.<br/>20. Generally, most exotic species are controlled by pulling the plants out of the soil or by spraying, both of which are time consuming and expensive.<br/>"
Marathon-Marathon_races,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Marathon<br/>Section: Marathon races<br/><br/>1.  races.Annually, more than 500 marathons are organized worldwide.<br/>2. Some of these belong to the Association of International Marathons and Distance Races (AIMS) which has grown since its foundation in 1982 to embrace over 300 member events in 83 countries and territories.<br/>3. The marathons of Berlin, Boston, Chicago, London, New York City and Tokyo form the World Marathon Majors series, awarding $500,000 annually to the best overall male and female performers in the series.In 2006, the editors of Runner's World selected a ""World's Top 10 Marathons"", in which the Amsterdam, Honolulu, Paris, Rotterdam, and Stockholm marathons were featured along with the five mentioned above.<br/>4. Other notable large marathons include United States Marine Corps Marathon, Los Angeles, and Rome.<br/>5. The Boston Marathon is the world's oldest annual marathon, inspired by the success of the 1896 Olympic marathon and held since 1897.<br/>6. The oldest annual marathon in Europe is the Košice Peace Marathon, held since 1924 in Košice, Slovakia.<br/>7. The historic Polytechnic Marathon was discontinued in 1996.<br/>8. The Athens Classic Marathon traces the route of the 1896 Olympic course, starting in Marathon on the eastern coast of Attica, site of the Battle of Marathon of 490 B.C.E., and ending at the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens.The Midnight Sun Marathon is held in Tromsø, Norway at 70 degrees north.<br/>9. Using unofficial and temporary courses, measured by GPS, races of marathon distance are now held at the North Pole, in Antarctica and over desert terrain.<br/>10. Other unusual marathons include the Great Wall Marathon on The Great Wall of China, the Big Five Marathon among the safari wildlife of South Africa, the Great Tibetan Marathon – a marathon in an atmosphere of Tibetan Buddhism at an altitude of , and the Polar Circle Marathon on the permanent ice cap of Greenland.The Intercontinental Istanbul Eurasia Marathon is the only marathon where participants run over two continents (Europe and Asia) during the course of a single event.<br/>11. In the Detroit Free Press Marathon, participants cross the US/Canadian border twice.<br/>12. The Niagara Falls International Marathon includes one international border crossing, via the Peace Bridge from Buffalo, New York, United States to Fort Erie, Ontario, Canada.<br/>"
South_Park-Abstract,"Category: Tv<br/>Title: South Park<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. South Park is an American adult animated sitcom created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone for the Comedy Central television network.<br/>2. Intended for mature audiences, the show has become famous for its crude language and dark, surreal humor that satirizes a wide range of topics.<br/>3. The ongoing narrative revolves around four boys—Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick—and their bizarre adventures in and around the titular Colorado town.Parker and Stone developed the show from two animated shorts they created in 1992 and 1995.<br/>4. The latter became one of the first Internet viral videos, which ultimately led to its production as a series.<br/>5. ""South Park"" debuted in August 1997 with great success, consistently earning the highest ratings of any basic cable program.<br/>6. Subsequent ratings have varied but it remains one of Comedy Central's highest rated shows, and is slated to air through at least 2016.<br/>7. The pilot episode was produced using cutout animation.<br/>8. All subsequent episodes are created with software that emulates the cutout technique.<br/>9. Parker and Stone perform most of the voice acting.<br/>10. Since 2000, each episode is typically written and produced during the week preceding its broadcast, with Parker serving as the primary writer and director.<br/>11. There have been a total of episodes over the course of the show's 17 seasons.The series has received numerous accolades, including five Primetime Emmy Awards, a Peabody Award, and numerous inclusions in various publications' lists of greatest television shows.<br/>12. The show's popularity resulted in a feature-length theatrical film, """" which was released in June 1999, less than two years after the show's premiere, and became a commercial and critical success.<br/>13. In 2013, ""TV Guide"" ranked ""South Park"" the tenth Greatest TV Cartoon of All Time.<br/>"
Golf-Rules_and_regulations,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Golf<br/>Section: Rules and regulations<br/><br/>1. The rules of golf are internationally standardised and are jointly governed by The R&A, spun off in 2004 from The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews (founded 1754), and the United States Golf Association (USGA).The underlying principle of the rules is fairness.<br/>2. As stated on the back cover of the official rule book:<br/>3. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Play the ball as it lies, play the course as you find it, and if you cannot do either, do what is fair.<br/>4. ""<br/><br/>5. There are strict regulations regarding the amateur status of golfers.</br>6. Essentially, anybody who has ever received payment or compensation for giving instruction, or played golf for money, is not considered an amateur and may not participate in competitions limited solely to amateurs.<br/>7. However, amateur golfers may receive expenses that comply with strict guidelines and they may accept non-cash prizes within the limits established by the Rules of Amateur Status.In addition to the officially printed rules, golfers also abide by a set of guidelines called golf etiquette.<br/>8. Etiquette guidelines cover matters such as safety, fairness, pace of play, and a player's obligation to contribute to the care of the course.<br/>9. Though there are no penalties for breach of etiquette rules, players generally follow the rules of golf etiquette in an effort to improve everyone's playing experience.<br/>"
Family_Guy-Origins,"Category: Tv<br/>Title: Family Guy<br/>Section: Origins<br/><br/>1. MacFarlane initially conceived ""Family Guy"" in 1995 while studying animation at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD).<br/>2. During college, he created his thesis film entitled ""The Life of Larry"", which was submitted by his professor at RISD to Hanna-Barbera.<br/>3. MacFarlane was hired by the company.<br/>4. In 1996 MacFarlane created a sequel to ""The Life of Larry"" entitled ""Larry and Steve"", which featured a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve; the short was broadcast in 1997 as one of Cartoon Network's ""World Premiere Toons"".Executives at Fox saw the ""Larry"" shorts and contracted MacFarlane to create a series, entitled ""Family Guy"", based on the characters.<br/>5. Fox proposed MacFarlane complete a 15-minute short, and gave him a budget of $50,000.<br/>6. Several aspects of ""Family Guy"" were inspired by the ""Larry shorts"".<br/>7. While working on the series, the characters of Larry and his dog Steve slowly evolved into Peter and Brian.<br/>8. MacFarlane stated that the difference between ""The Life of Larry"" and ""Family Guy"" was that """"Life of Larry"" was shown primarily in my dorm room and ""Family Guy"" was shown after the Super Bowl.""<br/>9. After the pilot aired, the series was given the green light.<br/>10. MacFarlane drew inspiration from several sitcoms such as ""The Simpsons"" and ""All in the Family"".<br/>11. Premises were drawn from several 1980s Saturday morning cartoons he watched as a child, such as ""The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang"" and ""Rubik, the Amazing Cube"".The Griffin family first appeared on the demo that MacFarlane pitched to Fox on May 15, 1998.<br/>12. ""Family Guy"" was originally planned to start out as short movies for the sketch show ""MADtv"", but the plan changed because MADtv's budget was not large enough to support animation production.<br/>13. MacFarlane noted that he then wanted to pitch it to Fox, as he thought that that was the place to create a prime-time animation show.<br/>14. ""Family Guy"" was originally pitched to Fox in the same year as ""King of the Hill"", but the show was not bought until years later, when ""King of the Hill"" became successful.<br/>15. Fox ordered 13 episodes of ""Family Guy"" to air in midseason after MacFarlane impressed executives with a seven-minute demo.<br/>"

Rory's friendships with long-time best friend Lane Kim (Keiko Agena), a second-generation Korean American from a strict Christian home, and Paris Geller (Liza Weil), a friend/rival at both Chilton and Yale, play strongly in the show.<br/>2. Although she shares a close bond with the two, they do not appear to get along with one another.<br/>3. At the end of the Season 6, Lane marries Hep Alien band-mate Zach van Gerbig (Todd Lowe), a sweet, slightly clumsy rocker.<br/>4. At the beginning of the Season 7, Lane discovers that she is unexpectedly pregnant and gives birth to twins (Kwan and Steve) later in the season.<br/>5. Also in Season 7, Paris is accepted to Harvard Medical School (Harvard is the school she has wanted to go to for years, as her family are all alumni, but was rejected for undergraduate studies in Season 3).<br/>6. In Season 4, Doyle McMaster (Danny Strong) storms onto the show as the ""Yale Daily News"" editor.<br/>7. He and Paris start dating in Season 5, after Paris's relationship with a much older Professor Asher Fleming (Michael York) ends with Fleming's sudden death.<br/>"
Cold_War-Gorbachev_reforms,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Cold War<br/>Section: Gorbachev reforms<br/><br/>1. Final years (1985–91).Gorbachev reforms.By the time the comparatively youthful Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary in 1985, the Soviet economy was stagnant and faced a sharp fall in foreign currency earnings as a result of the downward slide in oil prices in the 1980s.<br/>2. These issues prompted Gorbachev to investigate measures to revive the ailing state.An ineffectual start led to the conclusion that deeper structural changes were necessary and in June 1987 Gorbachev announced an agenda of economic reform called ""perestroika"", or restructuring.<br/>3. Perestroika relaxed the production quota system, allowed private ownership of businesses and paved the way for foreign investment.<br/>4. These measures were intended to redirect the country's resources from costly Cold War military commitments to more productive areas in the civilian sector.Despite initial skepticism in the West, the new Soviet leader proved to be committed to reversing the Soviet Union's deteriorating economic condition instead of continuing the arms race with the West.<br/>5. Partly as a way to fight off internal opposition from party cliques to his reforms, Gorbachev simultaneously introduced ""glasnost"", or openness, which increased freedom of the press and the transparency of state institutions.<br/>6. ""Glasnost"" was intended to reduce the corruption at the top of the Communist Party and moderate the abuse of power in the Central Committee.<br/>7. Glasnost also enabled increased contact between Soviet citizens and the western world, particularly with the United States, contributing to the accelerating détente between the two nations.<br/>"
Periodic_table-Categories,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Periodic table<br/>Section: Categories<br/><br/>1. The elements can be conveniently classified according to their shared physical and chemical properties into the major categories of metals, metalloids and nonmetals.<br/>2. Metals are generally located to the left and bottom of the periodic table.<br/>3. They are ordinarily shiny, highly conducting solids which form alloys with one another and salt-like ionic compounds with nonmetals.<br/>4. Nonmetals are located to the right and top.<br/>5. They are mostly coloured or colourless insulating gases that form covalent compounds with one another.<br/>6. In between metals and nonmetals are metalloids, which have intermediate or mixed properties.Metal and nonmetals can be further classified into similar subcategories that show a left to right gradation in metallic to non-metallic properties.<br/>7. The metals are divided into the highly reactive alkali metals, through the less reactive alkaline earth metals, lanthanides and actinides, via the archetypal transition metals, and ending in the physically and chemically weak other metals.<br/>8. The nonmetals are simply subdivided into the polyatomic nonmetals which, being nearest the metalloids, show some incipient metallic character; the diatomic nonmetals, which are essentially nonmetallic; and the monatomic noble gases, which are almost completely inert and nonmetallic.<br/>9. Specialized groupings such as the refractory metals and the noble metals, which are subsets (in this example) of the transition metals, are also known and occasionally denoted.Placing the elements into categories and subcategories based on shared properties is imperfect.<br/>10. There is a spectrum of properties within each category and it is not hard to find overlaps at the boundaries, as is the case with most classification schemes.<br/>11. Beryllium, for example, is classified as an alkaline earth metal although its amphoteric chemistry and tendency to mostly form covalent compounds are both attributes of a chemically weak or other metal.<br/>12. Radon is classified as a nonmetal and a noble gas yet has some cationic chemistry that is more characteristic of a metal.<br/>13. Other classification schemes are possible such as the division of the elements into mineralogical occurrence categories, or crystalline structures.<br/>14. Categorising the elements in this fashion dates back to at least 1869 when Hinrichs wrote that simple boundary lines could be drawn on the periodic table to show elements having like properties, such as the metals and the nonmetals, or the gaseous elements.<br/>"
Football-Cambridge_rules,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Football<br/>Section: Cambridge rules<br/><br/>1. In 1848, at Cambridge University, Mr. H. de Winton and Mr. J.C. Thring, who were both formerly at Shrewsbury School, called a meeting at Trinity College, Cambridge with 12 other representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester and Shrewsbury.<br/>2. An eight-hour meeting produced what amounted to the first set of modern rules, known as the ""Cambridge rules"".<br/>3. No copy of these rules now exists, but a revised version from circa 1856 is held in the library of Shrewsbury School.<br/>4. The rules clearly favour the kicking game.<br/>5. Handling was only allowed ""when a player catches the ball directly from the foot"" entitling them to a free kick and there was a primitive offside rule, disallowing players from ""loitering"" around the opponents' goal.<br/>6. The Cambridge rules were not widely adopted outside English public schools and universities (but it was arguably the most significant influence on the Football Association committee members responsible for formulating the rules of Association football).<br/>"

Yeast-Ecology,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Yeast<br/>Section: Ecology<br/><br/>1. Yeasts are very common in the environment, and are often isolated from sugar-rich materials.<br/>2. Examples include naturally occurring yeasts on the skins of fruits and berries (such as grapes, apples, or peaches), and exudates from plants (such as plant saps or cacti).<br/>3. Some yeasts are found in association with soil and insects.<br/>4. The ecological function and biodiversity of yeasts are relatively unknown compared to those of other microorganisms.<br/>5. Yeasts, including ""Candida albicans"", ""Rhodotorula rubra"", ""Torulopsis"" and ""Trichosporon cutaneum"", have been found living in between people's toes as part of their skin flora.<br/>6. Yeasts are also present in the gut flora of mammals and some insects and even deep-sea environments host an array of yeasts.An Indian study of seven bee species and 9 plant species found 45 species from 16 genera colonise the nectaries of flowers and honey stomachs of bees.<br/>7. Most were members of the ""Candida"" genus; the most common species in honey stomachs was ""Dekkera intermedia"" and in flower nectaries, ""Candida blankii"".<br/>8. Yeast colonising nectaries of the stinking hellebore have been found to raise the temperature of the flower, which may aid in attracting pollinators by increasing the evaporation of volatile organic compounds.<br/>9. A black yeast has been recorded as a partner in a complex relationship between ants, their mutualistic fungus, a fungal parasite of the fungus and a bacterium that kills the parasite.<br/>10. The yeast has a negative effect on the bacteria that normally produce antibiotics to kill the parasite, so may affect the ants' health by allowing the parasite to spread.<br/>"
World_War_I-July_Crisis,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: World War I<br/>Section: July Crisis<br/><br/>1. The assassination led to a month of diplomatic manoeuvring between Austria-Hungary, Germany, Russia, France, and Britain which was called the July Crisis.<br/>2. Believing correctly that Serbian officials (especially the officers of the Black Hand) were involved in the plot, and wanting to finally end Serbian interference in Bosnia, Austria-Hungary delivered to Serbia the July Ultimatum, a series of ten demands intentionally made unacceptable, intending to provoke a war with Serbia.<br/>3. When Serbia agreed to only eight of the ten demands, Austria-Hungary declared war on 28 July 1914.<br/>4. Strachan argues, ""Whether an equivocal and early response by Serbia would have made any difference to Austria-Hungary's behaviour must be doubtful.<br/>5. Franz Ferdinand was not the sort of personality who commanded popularity, and his demise did not cast the empire into deepest mourning"".The Russian Empire, unwilling to allow Austria-Hungary to eliminate its influence in the Balkans, and in support of its longtime Serb protégé, ordered a partial mobilisation one day later, 29 July.<br/>6. Germany mobilised on 30 July, and Russia responded by declaring a full mobilisation that same day.<br/>7. Germany imposed an ultimatum on Russia, through its ambassador in Berlin, to demobilise within 12 hours or face war.<br/>8. Russia responded by offering to negotiate the terms of a demobilisation.<br/>9. However, Germany refused to negotiate, declaring war against Russia on 1 August 1914.Germany's war plan, the Schlieffen Plan, relied on a quick, massive invasion of France to eliminate the threat on the West, before turning east against Russia.<br/>10. Simultaneously with its mobilisation against Russia, therefore, the German government issued demands that France remain neutral.<br/>11. The French cabinet resisted military pressure to commence immediate mobilisation, and ordered its troops to withdraw from the border to avoid any incident.<br/>12. Germany attacked Luxembourg on 2 August, and on 3 August declared war on France.<br/>13. On 4 August, after Belgium refused to permit German troops to cross its borders into France, Germany declared war on Belgium as well.<br/>14.

After the war Moore received an ex-serviceman's grant to continue his education and in 1919 he became a student at the Leeds School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him.<br/>2. At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years.<br/>3. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development.<br/>4. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries.<br/>5. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum.The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals.<br/>6. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture.<br/>7. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach.<br/>8. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's ""The Virgin and Child"" by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical technique of ""pointing"".<br/>9. Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing machine.In 1924, Moore won a six-month travelling scholarship which he spent in Northern Italy studying the great works of Michelangelo, Giotto di Bondone, Giovanni Pisano and several other Old Masters.<br/>10. During this period he also visited Paris, took advantage of the timed-sketching classes at the Académie Colarossi, and viewed, in the Trocadero, a plaster cast of a Toltec-Maya sculptural form, the Chac Mool, previously seen in book illustrations.<br/>11. The reclining figure was to have a profound effect upon Moore's work, becoming the primary motif of his sculpture.<br/>"
Solar_System-Kuiper_belt,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Solar System<br/>Section: Kuiper belt<br/><br/>1. The Kuiper belt is a great ring of debris similar to the asteroid belt, but consisting mainly of objects composed primarily of ice.<br/>2. It extends between 30 and 50 AU from the Sun.<br/>3. Though it is estimated to contain anything from dozens to thousands of dwarf planets, it is composed mainly of small Solar System bodies.<br/>4. Many of the larger Kuiper belt objects, such as Quaoar, Varuna, and Orcus, may prove to be dwarf planets with further data.<br/>5. There are estimated to be over 100,000 Kuiper belt objects with a diameter greater than 50 km, but the total mass of the Kuiper belt is thought to be only a tenth or even a hundredth the mass of Earth.<br/>6. Many Kuiper belt objects have multiple satellites, and most have orbits that take them outside the plane of the ecliptic.The Kuiper belt can be roughly divided into the ""classical"" belt and the resonances.<br/>7. Resonances are orbits linked to that of Neptune (e.g.<br/>8. twice for every three Neptune orbits, or once for every two).<br/>9. The first resonance begins within the orbit of Neptune itself.<br/>10. The classical belt consists of objects having no resonance with Neptune, and extends from roughly 39.4 AU to 47.7 AU.<br/>11. Members of the classical Kuiper belt are classified as cubewanos, after the first of their kind to be discovered, , and are still in near primordial, low-eccentricity orbits.<br/>"
The_Usual_Suspects-Origins,"Category: Movies<br/>Title: The Usual Suspects<br/>Section: Origins<br/><br/>1. Production.Origins.Bryan Singer met Kevin Spacey at a party after a screening of the young filmmaker's first film, ""Public Access"", at the 1993 Sundance Film Festival.<br/>2. Spacey had been encouraged by a number of people he knew who had seen it, and was so impressed that he told Singer and McQuarrie that he wanted to be in whatever film they did next.<br/>3. Singer read a column in ""Spy"" magazine called ""The Usual Suspects"" after Claude Rains' line in ""Casablanca.""<br/>4. Singer thought that it would be a good title for a film.<br/>5. When asked by a reporter at Sundance what their next film was about, McQuarrie replied, ""I guess it's about a bunch of criminals who meet in a police line-up,"" which incidentally was the first visual idea that he and Singer had for the poster: ""five guys who meet in a line-up,"" Singer remembers.<br/>6. The director also envisioned a tagline for the poster, ""All of you can go to Hell.""<br/>7. Singer then asked the question, ""What would possibly bring these five felons together in one line-up?""<br/>8. McQuarrie revamped an idea from one of his own unpublished screenplays — the story of a man who murders his own family and walks away, disappearing from view.<br/>9. The writer mixed this with the idea of a team of criminals.Söze's character is based on the accounts of John List, a New Jersey accountant who murdered his family in 1971 and then disappeared for almost two decades, assuming a new identity before he was ultimately apprehended.<br/>10. McQuarrie based the name of Keyser Söze on one of his previous supervisors, Keyser Sume, at a Los Angeles law firm that he worked for, but decided to change the last name because he thought that his former boss would object to how it was used.<br/>11. He found the word ""söze"" in his roommate's English-to-Turkish dictionary, which translates as ""talk too much.""<br/>12. All the characters' names are taken from staff members of the law firm at the time of his employment.<br/>13. McQuarrie had also worked for a detective agency, and this influenced the depiction of criminals and law enforcement officials in the script.Singer described the film as ""Double Indemnity"" meets ""Rashomon,"" and said that it was made ""so you can go back and see all sorts of things you didn't realize were there the first time.<br/>14. You can get it a second time in a way you never could have the first time around.""<br/>15. He also compared the film's structure to ""Citizen Kane"" (which also contained an interrogator and a subject who is telling a story) and the criminal caper ""The Anderson Tapes.""<br/>"
Black_hole-Physical_properties,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Black hole<br/>Section: Physical properties<br/><br/>1. The simplest static black holes have mass but neither electric charge nor angular momentum.<br/>2. These black holes are often referred to as Schwarzschild black holes after Karl Schwarzschild who discovered this solution in 1916.<br/>3. According to Birkhoff's theorem, it is the only vacuum solution that is spherically symmetric.<br/>4. This means that there is no observable difference between the gravitational field of such a black hole and that of any other spherical object of the same mass.<br/>5. The popular notion of a black hole ""sucking in everything"" in its surroundings is therefore only correct near a black hole's horizon; far away, the external gravitational field is identical to that of any other body of the same mass.Solutions describing more general black holes also exist.<br/>6. Charged black holes are described by the Reissner–Nordström metric, while the Kerr metric describes a rotating black hole.<br/>7. The most general stationary black hole solution known is the Kerr–Newman metric, which describes a black hole with both charge and angular momentum.While the mass of a black hole can take any positive value, the charge and angular momentum are constrained by the mass.<br/>8. In Planck units, the total electric charge ""Q"" and the total angular momentum ""J"" are expected to satisfy<br/>9. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;formula_1<br/><br/>10. for a black hole of mass ""M"".</br>11. Black holes saturating this inequality are called extremal.<br/>12. Solutions of Einstein's equations that violate this inequality exist, but they do not possess an event horizon.<br/>13. These solutions have so-called naked singularities that can be observed from the outside, and hence are deemed ""unphysical"".<br/>14. The cosmic censorship hypothesis rules out the formation of such singularities, when they are created through the gravitational collapse of realistic matter.<br/>15. This is supported by numerical simulations.Due to the relatively large strength of the electromagnetic force, black holes forming from the collapse of stars are expected to retain the nearly neutral charge of the star.<br/>16. Rotation, however, is expected to be a common feature of compact objects.<br/>17. The black-hole candidate binary X-ray source GRS 1915+105 appears to have an angular momentum near the maximum allowed value.Black holes are commonly classified according to their mass, independent of angular momentum ""J"" or electric charge ""Q"".<br/>18. The size of a black hole, as determined by the radius of the event horizon, or Schwarzschild radius, is roughly proportional to the mass ""M"" through<br/>19. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;formula_2<br/><br/>20. where ""r""sh is the Schwarzschild radius and ""MSun"" is the mass of the Sun.</br>21. This relation is exact only for black holes with zero charge and angular momentum; for more general black holes it can differ up to a factor of 2.<br/>"

Another claim from 1885 comes from Frank and Charles Menches who claim to have sold a ground beef sandwich at the Erie County Fair in Hamburg, New York.<br/>2. During the fair, they ran out of pork sausage for their sandwiches and substituted beef.<br/>3. Kunzog, who spoke to Frank Menches, says they exhausted their supply of sausage, so purchased chopped up beef from a butcher, Andrew Klein.<br/>4. Though historian Joseph Streamer wrote that the meat was from Stein's market not Klein's; despite Stein having sold the market in 1874.<br/>5.

South_Korea-Education,"Category: Country<br/>Title: South Korea<br/>Section: Education<br/><br/>1. Education in South Korea is regarded as crucial to financial and social success, and competition is consequently fierce, with many participating in intense outside tutoring to supplement classes.<br/>2. In the 2006 results of the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment, South Korea came first in problem solving, third in mathematics and seventh in science.<br/>3. South Korea's education system is technologically advanced and it is the world's first country to bring high-speed fibre-optic broadband internet access to every primary and secondary school nation-wide.<br/>4. Using this infrastructure, the country has developed the first Digital Textbooks in the world, which will be distributed for free to every primary and secondary school nation-wide by 2013.A centralised administration in South Korea oversees the process for the education of children from kindergarten to the third and final year of high school.<br/>5. South Korea has adopted a new educational program to increase the number of their foreign students through 2010.<br/>6. According to Ministry of Education, Science and Technology estimate, by that time, the number of scholarships for foreign students in South Korea will be doubled, and the number of foreign students will reach 100,000.The school year is divided into two semesters, the first of which begins in the beginning of March and ends in mid-July, the second of which begins in late August and ends in mid-February.<br/>7. The schedules are not uniformly standardized and vary from school to school.Most South Korean middle schools and high schools have school uniforms, modeled on western-style uniforms.<br/>8. Boys' uniforms usually consists of trousers and white shirts, and girls wear skirts and white shirts (this only applies in middle schools and high schools).<br/>"

Through the use of his vanity cards at the end of episodes, Lorre alleged that the program had been plagiarized by a show produced and aired in Belarus.<br/>2. Officially titled Теоретики (""The Theorists""), the show features ""clones"" of the main characters, a similar opening sequence, and what appears to be a very close Russian translation of the scripts.<br/>3. Lorre expressed annoyance and described his inquiry with the Warner Brothers legal department about options.<br/>4. The television production company and station's close relationship with the Belarus government was cited as the reason that any attempt to claim copyright infringement would be in vain because the company copying the episodes is operated by the government.However, no legal action was required to end production of the other show: as soon as the word got out that the show was unlicensed, the actors quit and the producers cancelled it.<br/>5. Dmitriy Tankovich (who plays Leonard's counterpart, ""Seva"") said in an interview: ""I'm upset.<br/>6. At first, the actors were told all legal issues were resolved.<br/>7.

Last_Supper-Artistic_depictions,"Category: Art<br/>Title: Last Supper<br/>Section: Artistic depictions<br/><br/>1. The Last Supper has been a popular subject in Christian art.<br/>2. Depictions of the Last Supper in Christian art date back to early Christianity and can be seen in the Catacombs of Rome.<br/>3. Byzantine artists frequently focused on the Apostles receiving Communion, rather than the reclining figures having a meal.<br/>4. By the Renaissance, the Last Supper was a favorite topic in Italian art.There are three major themes in the depictions of the last supper.<br/>5. The first theme is the dramatic and dynamic depiction of Jesus' announcement of his betrayal.<br/>6. The second theme is the moment of the institution of the tradition of the Eucharist.<br/>7. The depictions here are generally solemn and mystical.<br/>8. The third major theme is the farewell of Jesus to his disciples, in which Judas Iscariot is no longer present, having left the supper.<br/>9. The depictions here are generally melancholy, as Jesus prepares his disciples for his departure.<br/>10. There are also other, less frequently depicted scenes, such as the washing of the feet of the disciples.Well known examples include Leonardo da Vinci's depiction, which is considered the first work of High Renaissance art due to its high level of harmony, Tintoretto's depiction which is unusual in that it includes secondary characters carrying or taking the dishes from the table and Salvadore Dali's depiction combines the typical Christian themes with modern approaches of Surrealism.<br/>"
Great_Sphinx_of_Giza-Modern_dissenting_hypotheses,"Category: Art<br/>Title: Great Sphinx of Giza<br/>Section: Modern dissenting hypotheses<br/><br/>1. Rainer Stadelmann, former director of the German Archaeological Institute in Cairo, examined the distinct iconography of the ""nemes"" (headdress) and the now-detached beard of the Sphinx and concluded that the style is more indicative of the Pharaoh Khufu (2589–2566 BC), builder of the Great Pyramid of Giza and Khafra's father.<br/>2. He supports this by suggesting that Khafra's Causeway was built to conform to a pre-existing structure, which, he concludes, given its location, could only have been the Sphinx.Colin Reader, an English geologist who independently conducted a more recent survey of the enclosure, agrees that the various quarries on the site have been excavated around the Causeway.<br/>3. Because these quarries are known to have been used by Khufu, Reader concludes that the Causeway (and the temples on either end thereof) must predate Khufu, thereby casting doubt on the conventional Egyptian chronology.In 2004, Vassil Dobrev of the Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale in Cairo announced that he had uncovered new evidence that the Great Sphinx may have been the work of the little-known Pharaoh Djedefre (2528–2520 BC), Khafra's half brother and a son of Khufu.<br/>4. Dobrev suggests that Djedefre built the Sphinx in the image of his father Khufu, identifying him with the sun god Ra in order to restore respect for their dynasty.<br/>5. Dobrev also notes, like Stadelmann and others, that the causeway connecting Khafre's pyramid to the temples was built around the Sphinx suggesting it was already in existence at the time.<br/>"
Kebab-In_Norway,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Kebab<br/>Section: In Norway<br/><br/>1. In Norway, the kebab was introduced by Pakistani and Turkish immigrants during the 1980s.<br/>2. The kebab has become a symbol of immigration from the Muslim world, and speaking Norwegian with an Arab accent or with a lot of words and expressions borrowed from the Pakistani, Turkish, Arabic, and Persian languages is sometimes referred to as ""Kebabnorsk"" (Kebab Norwegian).The kebabs in Norway are served in a variety of ways, commonly in fast-food shops selling both hamburgers and kebabs.<br/>3. The kebab roll has become increasingly popular, with the kebab not served in pita bread, but rather wrapped in pizza dough (making it look like a spring roll) for easy consumption.<br/>4. The most ""Norwegian"" kebab to date is probably the whalemeat kebab sold at the Inferno Metal Festival.<br/>5. As of 2008, the average price of the kebab in Norway lies around 65 kroner, or about €8.<br/>6. In Bergen the average price of a kebab is around 50 kr.<br/>7. In Bergen kebab is most commonly served in the dürüm variety, with two types of sauces, one standard and one optional hot chili variety.The Norwegian Food Safety Authority in 2007 issued a warning about cheap kebabs.<br/>8. According to ""Verdens Gang"" they estimated that more than 80% of kebab shops in Oslo use illegally produced meat.<br/>9. It was warned that such meat could be dangerous to eat because it could contain salmonella or other bacteria, and that it could be connected to organised crime.<br/>"

Rice-Nutrients_and_the_nutritional_importance_of_rice,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Rice<br/>Section: Nutrients and the nutritional importance of rice<br/><br/>1. Nutrition and health.Nutrients and the nutritional importance of rice.Rice is the staple food of over half the world's population.<br/>2. It is the predominant dietary energy source for 17 countries in Asia and the Pacific, 9 countries in North and South America and 8 countries in Africa.<br/>3. Rice provides 20% of the world’s dietary energy supply, while wheat supplies 19% and maize (corn) 5%.A detailed analysis of nutrient content of rice suggests that the nutrition value of rice varies based on a number of factors.<br/>4. It depends on the strain of rice, that is between white, brown, black, red and purple varieties of rice – each prevalent in different parts of the world.<br/>5. It also depends on nutrient quality of the soil rice is grown in, whether and how the rice is polished or processed, the manner it is enriched, and how it is prepared before consumption.An illustrative comparison between white and brown rice of protein quality, mineral and vitamin quality, carbohydrate and fat quality suggests that neither is a complete nutrition source.<br/>6. Between the two, there is a significant difference in fiber content and minor differences in other nutrients.Brilliantly colored rice strains, such as purple rice, derive their color from anthocyanins and tocols.<br/>7. Scientific studies suggest that these color pigments have antioxidant properties that may be useful to human health.<br/>8. In purple rice bran, hydrophilic antioxidants are in greater quantity and have higher free radical scavenging activity than lipophilic antioxidants.<br/>9. Anthocyanins and γ-tocols in purple rice are largely located in the inner portion of purple rice bran.Comparative nutrition studies on red, black and white varieties of rice suggest that pigments in red and black rice varieties may offer nutritional benefits.<br/>10. Red or black rice consumption was found to reduce or retard the progression of atherosclerotic plaque development, induced by dietary cholesterol, in mammals.<br/>11. White rice consumption offered no similar benefits, and the study claims this to be due to absent antioxidants in red and black varieties of rice.<br/>"
Coffee-Roasting,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Coffee<br/>Section: Roasting<br/><br/>1. The next step in the process is the roasting of the green coffee.<br/>2. Coffee is usually sold in a roasted state, and with rare exceptions all coffee is roasted before it is consumed.<br/>3. It can be sold roasted by the supplier, or it can be home roasted.<br/>4. The roasting process influences the taste of the beverage by changing the coffee seed both physically and chemically.<br/>5. The seed decreases in weight as moisture is lost and increases in volume, causing it to become less dense.<br/>6. The density of the seed also influences the strength of the coffee and requirements for packaging.The actual roasting begins when the temperature inside the seed reaches approximately , though different varieties of seeds differ in moisture and density and therefore roast at different rates.<br/>7. During roasting, caramelization occurs as intense heat breaks down starches, changing them to simple sugars that begin to brown, which alters the color of the seed.Sucrose is rapidly lost during the roasting process and may disappear entirely in darker roasts.<br/>8. During roasting, aromatic oils and acids weaken, changing the flavor; at , other oils start to develop.<br/>9. One of these oils, caffeol, is created at about , which is largely responsible for coffee's aroma and flavor.<br/>"
Russia-Demographics,"Category: Country<br/>Title: Russia<br/>Section: Demographics<br/><br/>1. Ethnic Russians comprise 81% of the country's population.<br/>2. The Russian Federation is also home to several sizeable minorities.<br/>3. In all, 160 different other ethnic groups and indigenous peoples live within its borders.<br/>4. Though Russia's population is comparatively large, its density is low because of the country's enormous size.<br/>5. Population is densest in European Russia, near the Ural Mountains, and in southwest Siberia.<br/>6. 73% of the population lives in urban areas while 27% in rural ones.<br/>7. The results of the 2010 Census show a total population of 142,856,536.Russia's population peaked at 148,689,000 in 1991, just before the dissolution of the Soviet Union.<br/>8. It began to experience a rapid decline starting in the mid-1990s.<br/>9. The decline has slowed to near stagnation in recent years because of reduced death rates, increased birth rates and increased immigration.In 2009, Russia recorded annual population growth for the first time in fifteen years, with total growth of 10,500.<br/>10. 279,906 migrants arrived to the Russian Federation the same year, of which 93% came from CIS countries.<br/>11. The number of Russian emigrants steadily declined from 359,000 in 2000 to 32,000 in 2009.<br/>12. There are also an estimated 10 million illegal immigrants from the ex-Soviet states in Russia.<br/>13. Roughly 116 million ethnic Russians live in Russia and about 20 million more live in other former republics of the Soviet Union, mostly in Ukraine and Kazakhstan.The 2010 census recorded 81% of the population as ethnically Russian, and 19% as other ethnicities: 3.7% Tatars; 1.4% Ukrainians; 1.1% Bashkirs; 1% Chuvashes; 11.8% others and unspecified.<br/>14. According to the Census, 84.93% of the Russian population belongs to European ethnic groups (Slavic, Germanic, Finnic other than Ugric, Greek, and others).<br/>15. This is a decline from the 2002, when they constituted for more than 86% of the population.Russia's birth rate is higher than that of most European countries (12.6 births per 1000 people in 2010 compared to the European Union average of 9.90 per 1000), but its death rate is also substantially higher (in 2010, Russia's death rate was 14.3 per 1000 people compared to the EU average of 10.28 per 1000).<br/>16. The Russian Ministry of Health and Social Affairs predicted that by 2011 the death rate would equal the birth rate because of increase in fertility and decline in mortality.<br/>17. The government is implementing a number of programs designed to increase the birth rate and attract more migrants.<br/>18. Monthly government child-assistance payments were doubled to US$55, and a one-time payment of US$9,200 was offered to women who had a second child since 2007.In 2006, in a bid to compensate for the country's demographic decline, the Russian government started simplifying immigration laws and launched a state program ""for providing assistance to voluntary immigration of ethnic Russians from former Soviet republics"".<br/>19. In 2009 Russia experienced its highest birth rate since the dissolution of the Soviet Union.<br/>20. In 2012, the birth rate increased again.<br/>21. Russia recorded 1,896,263 births, the highest number since 1990, and even exceeding annual births during the period 1967–1969, with a TFR of about 1.7, the highest since 1991.<br/>22. (Source: Vital statistics table below)In August 2012, as the country saw its first demographic growth since the 1990s, President Putin declared that Russia's population could reach 146 million by 2025, mainly as a result of immigration.<br/>"

Basketball-Fouls,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Basketball<br/>Section: Fouls<br/><br/>1. An attempt to unfairly disadvantage an opponent through physical contact is illegal and is called a foul.<br/>2. These are most commonly committed by defensive players; however, they can be committed by offensive players as well.<br/>3. Players who are fouled either receive the ball to pass inbounds again, or receive one or more free throws if they are fouled in the act of shooting, depending on whether the shot was successful.<br/>4. One point is awarded for making a free throw, which is attempted from a line from the basket.The referee may use discretion in calling fouls (for example, by considering whether an unfair advantage was gained), sometimes making fouls controversial calls or no-calls.<br/>5. The calling of fouls can vary between games, leagues and even among referees.A player or coach who shows poor sportsmanship, such as by arguing with a referee or by fighting with another player, can be charged with a more serious foul called a technical foul.<br/>6. The penalty involves free throws (where, unlike a personal foul, the other team can choose any player to shoot) and varies among leagues.<br/>7. Repeated incidents can result in disqualification.<br/>8. A blatant foul involving physical contact that is either excessive or unnecessary is called an intentional foul (flagrant foul in the NBA).<br/>9. In FIBA, a foul resulting in ejection is called a disqualifying foul, while in leagues other than the NBA, such a foul is referred to as flagrant.If a team exceeds a certain limit of team fouls in a given period (quarter or half) – four for NBA and international games – the opposing team is awarded one or two free throws on all subsequent non-shooting fouls for that period, the number depending on the league.<br/>10. In the US college and high school games, if a team reaches 7 fouls in a half, the opposing team is awarded one free throw, along with a second shot if the first is made.<br/>11. This is called shooting ""one-and-one"".<br/>12. If a team exceeds 10 fouls in the half, the opposing team is awarded two free throws on all subsequent fouls for the half.When a team shoots foul shots, the opponents may not interfere with the shooter, nor may they try to regain possession until the last or potentially last free throw is in the air.After a team has committed a specified number of fouls, it is said to be ""in the penalty"".<br/>13. On scoreboards, this is usually signified with an indicator light reading ""Bonus"" or ""Penalty"" with an illuminated directional arrow indicating that team is to receive free throws when fouled by the opposing team.<br/>14. (Some scoreboards also indicate the number of fouls committed.<br/>15. )If a team misses the first shot of a two-shot situation, the opposing team must wait for the completion of the second shot before attempting to reclaim possession of the ball and continuing play.If a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is unsuccessful, the player is awarded a number of free throws equal to the value of the attempted shot.<br/>16. A player fouled while attempting a regular two-point shot, then, receives two shots.<br/>17. A player fouled while attempting a three-point shot, on the other hand, receives three shots.If a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is successful, typically the playerwill be awarded one additional free throw for one point.<br/>18. In combination with a regularshot, this is called a ""three-point play"" or ""four-point play"" (or more colloquially, an ""and one"") because of the basket made at the time of the foul (2 or 3 points) and the additional free throw (1 point).<br/>"
Salvador_Dalí-Literary_works,"Category: Art<br/>Title: Salvador Dalí<br/>Section: Literary works<br/><br/>1. Under the encouragement of poet Federico García Lorca, Dalí attempted an approach to a literary career through the means of the ""pure novel"".<br/>2. In his literary production ""Hidden Faces"" (1944), Dalí describes, in vividly visual terms, the intrigues and love affairs of a group of dazzling, eccentric aristocrats who, with their luxurious and extravagant lifestyle, symbolize the decadence of the 1930s.<br/>3. The Comte de Grainsalles and Solange de Cléda pursue an awkward love affair, but property transactions, interwar political turmoil, the French Resistance, his marriage to another woman and her responsibilities as a landowner and businesswoman drive them apart.<br/>4. It is variously set in Paris, rural France, Casablanca in North Africa and Palm Springs in the United States.<br/>5. Secondary characters include ageing widow Barbara Rogers, her bisexual daughter Veronica, Veronica's sometime female lover Betka, and Baba, a disfigured US fighter pilot.<br/>6. The novel concludes at the end of the Second World War, with Solange dying before Grainsalles can return to his former property and reunite with her His other, nonfictional literary works include ""The Secret Life of Salvador Dalí"" (1942), ""Diary of a Genius"" (1952–63), and ""Oui: The Paranoid-Critical Revolution "" (1927–33).<br/>"
Fight_Club-Cultural_impact,"Category: Movies<br/>Title: Fight Club<br/>Section: Cultural impact<br/><br/>1. <br/>2. ""Fight Club"" was one of the most controversial and talked-about films of the 1990s.<br/>3. Like other 1999 films ""Magnolia"", ""Being John Malkovich"", and ""Three Kings"", ""Fight Club"" was recognized as an innovator in cinematic form and style since it exploited new developments in filmmaking technology.<br/>4. After ""Fight Club""s theatrical release, it became more popular via word of mouth, and the positive reception of the DVD established it as a cult film that David Ansen of ""Newsweek"" conjectured would enjoy ""perennial"" fame.<br/>5. The film's success also heightened the profile of the novel's author, Chuck Palahniuk, to global renown.Following ""Fight Club""s release, several fight clubs were reported to have started in the United States.<br/>6. A ""Gentleman's Fight Club"" was started in Menlo Park, California in 2000 and had members mostly from the tech industry.<br/>7. Teens and preteens in Texas, New Jersey, Washington state, and Alaska also initiated fight clubs and posted videos of their fights online, leading authorities to break up the clubs.<br/>8. In 2006, an unwilling participant from a local high school was injured at a fight club in Arlington, Texas, and the DVD sales of the fight led to the arrest of six teenagers.<br/>9. An unsanctioned fight club was also started at Princeton University, where matches were held on campus.<br/>10. The film was suspected of influencing Luke Helder, a college student who planted pipe bombs in mailboxes in 2002.<br/>11. Helder's goal was to create a smiley pattern on the map of the United States, similar to the scene in ""Fight Club"" in which a building is vandalized to have a smiley on its exterior.<br/>12. On July 16, 2009, a 17-year-old who had formed his own fight club in Manhattan was charged with detonating a homemade bomb outside a Starbucks Coffee shop in the Upper East Side in May 2009; the New York City Police Department reported the suspect was trying to emulate ""Project Mayhem"".In 2003, ""Fight Club"" was listed as one of the ""50 Best Guy Movies of All Time"" by ""Men's Journal"".<br/>13. In 2004 and 2006, ""Fight Club"" was voted by ""Empire"" readers as the ninth and eighth greatest film of all time, respectively.<br/>14. ""Total Film"" ranked ""Fight Club"" as ""The Greatest Film of our Lifetime"" in 2007 during the magazine's tenth anniversary.<br/>15. In 2007, ""Premiere"" selected Tyler Durden's line, ""The first rule of fight club is you do not talk about fight club,"" as the 27th greatest movie line of all time.<br/>16. In 2008, readers of ""Empire"" ranked Tyler Durden first on a list of the 100 Greatest Movie Characters.<br/>17. ""Empire"" also identified ""Fight Club"" as the 10th greatest movie of all time in its 2008 issue ""The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time"".In 2010, two viral mash-up videos featuring ""Fight Club"" were released.<br/>18. ""Ferris Club"" was a mash-up of ""Fight Club"" and the film ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"".<br/>19. It portrayed Ferris as Tyler Durden and Cameron as the narrator, ""claiming to see the real psychological truth behind the John Hughes classic"".<br/>20. The second video ""Jane Austen's Fight Club"" also gained popularity online as a mash-up of ""Fight Club""s fighting rules and the characters created by 19th century novelist Jane Austen.<br/>"
The_Lord_of_the_Rings-Reception,"Category: Movies<br/>Title: The Lord of the Rings<br/>Section: Reception<br/><br/>1. While early reviews for The Lord of the Rings were mixed, reviews in various media have been, on the whole, highly positive and acknowledge Tolkien's literary achievement as a significant one.<br/>2. On its initial review the ""Sunday Telegraph"" felt it was ""among the greatest works of imaginative fiction of the twentieth century.""<br/>3. The ""Sunday Times"" seemed to echo these sentiments when in its review it was stated that ""the English-speaking world is divided into those who have read ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Hobbit"" and those who are going to read them.""<br/>4. The ""New York Herald Tribune"" also seemed to have an idea of how popular the books would become, writing in its review that they were ""destined to outlast our time.""<br/>5. W. H. Auden, an admirer of Tolkien's writings, regarded ""The Lord of the Rings"" as a ""masterpiece"", further stating that in some cases it outdid the achievement of John Milton's ""Paradise Lost"".<br/>6. ""New York Times"" reviewer Judith Shulevitz criticized the ""pedantry"" of Tolkien's literary style, saying that he ""formulated a high-minded belief in the importance of his mission as a literary preservationist, which turns out to be death to literature itself.""<br/>7. Critic Richard Jenkyns, writing in ""The New Republic"", criticized the work for a lack of psychological depth.<br/>8. Both the characters and the work itself are, according to Jenkyns, ""anemic, and lacking in fibre.""<br/>9. Even within Tolkien's literary group, The Inklings, reviews were mixed.<br/>10. Hugo Dyson complained loudly at its readings.<br/>11. However, another Inkling, C. S. Lewis, had very different feelings, writing, ""here are beauties which pierce like swords or burn like cold iron.<br/>12. Here is a book which will break your heart.""<br/>13. Despite these reviews and its lack of paperback printing until the 1960s, ""The Lord of the Rings"" initially sold well in hardback.In 1957, ""The Lord of the Rings"" was awarded the International Fantasy Award.<br/>14. Despite its numerous detractors, the publication of the Ace Books and Ballantine paperbacks helped ""The Lord of the Rings"" become immensely popular in the United States in the 1960s.<br/>15. The book has remained so ever since, ranking as one of the most popular works of fiction of the twentieth century, judged by both sales and reader surveys.<br/>16. In the 2003 ""Big Read"" survey conducted in Britain by the BBC, ""The Lord of the Rings"" was found to be the ""Nation's best-loved book.""<br/>17. In similar 2004 polls both Germany and Australia also found ""The Lord of the Rings"" to be their favourite book.<br/>18. In a 1999 poll of Amazon.com customers, ""The Lord of the Rings"" was judged to be their favourite ""book of the millennium.""<br/>19. ""The Lord of the Rings"" was awarded the Prometheus Hall of Fame Award in 2009.<br/>"
Yosemite_National_Park-U.S._National_Park_Service,"Category: Travel<br/>Title: Yosemite National Park<br/>Section: U.S. National Park Service<br/><br/>1. The National Park Service was formed in 1916, and Yosemite was transferred to that agency's jurisdiction.<br/>2. Tuolumne Meadows Lodge, Tioga Pass Road, and campgrounds at Tenaya and Merced lakes were also completed in 1916.<br/>3. Automobiles started to enter the park in ever-increasing numbers following the construction of all-weather highways to the park.<br/>4. The Yosemite Museum was founded in 1926 through the efforts of Ansel Franklin Hall.In 1903, a dam in the northern portion of the park was proposed.<br/>5. Located in the Hetch Hetchy Valley, its purpose was to provide water and hydroelectric power to San Francisco.<br/>6. Muir and the Sierra Club opposed the project, while others, including Gifford Pinchot, supported it.<br/>7. In 1913, the U.S. Congress authorized the O'Shaughnessy Dam through passage of the Raker Act.In the late 1920s, in an attempt that would be impossible to make today, a bid for Yosemite for the 1932 Winter Olympics was put forward.<br/>8. (Ultimately, Lake Placid, New York, hosted.<br/>9. )More recently, preservationists persuaded Congress to designate , or about 89% of the park, as the Yosemite Wilderness—a highly protected wilderness area.<br/>10. The Park Service has reduced artificial inducements to visit the park, such as the ""Firefall"", in which red-hot embers were pushed off a cliff near Glacier Point at night.<br/>11. Traffic congestion in Yosemite Valley during the summer months has become a concern.<br/>12. Two electric buses commenced service in September 1995.<br/>13. The buses are quiet and do not emit pollutants.<br/>14. Eventually, all the buses in Yosemite will be electric.<br/>15. The 1996 Yosemite Valley Landslide killed a hiker and the January 1997 Merced River flood damaged many roads and several campgrounds.<br/>"
Chernobyl_disaster-Debris_removal,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Chernobyl disaster<br/>Section: Debris removal<br/><br/>1. The worst of the radioactive debris was collected inside what was left of the reactor, much of it shoveled in by liquidators wearing heavy protective gear (dubbed ""bio-robots"" by the military); these workers could only spend a maximum of 40 seconds at a time working on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings because of the extremely high doses of radiation given off by the blocks of graphite and other debris.<br/>2. The reactor itself was covered with bags of sand, lead and boric acid dropped from helicopters: some 5,000 metric tons of material were dropped during the week that followed the accident.At the time there was still fear that the reactor could re-enter a self-sustaining nuclear chain-reaction and explode again, and a new containment structure was planned to prevent rain entering and triggering such an explosion, and to prevent further release of radioactive material.<br/>3. This was the largest civil engineering task in history, involving a quarter of a million construction workers who all reached their official lifetime limits of radiation.<br/>4. By December 1986, a large concrete sarcophagus had been erected to seal off the reactor and its contents.<br/>5. A unique ""clean up"" medal was given to the workers.Many of the vehicles used by the ""liquidators"" remain parked in a field in the Chernobyl area.During the construction of the sarcophagus, a scientific team re-entered the reactor as part of an investigation dubbed ""Complex Expedition"", to locate and contain nuclear fuel in a way that could not lead to another explosion.<br/>6. These scientists manually collected cold fuel rods, but great heat was still emanating from the core.<br/>7. Rates of radiation in different parts of the building were monitored by drilling holes into the reactor and inserting long metal detector tubes.<br/>8. The scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation and radioactive dust.After six months of investigation, in December 1986, they discovered with the help of a remote camera an intensely radioactive mass in the basement of Unit Four, more than two metres wide and weighing hundreds of tons, which they called ""the elephant's foot"" for its wrinkled appearance.<br/>9. The mass was composed of sand, glass and a large amount of nuclear fuel that had escaped from the reactor.<br/>10. The concrete beneath the reactor was steaming hot, and was breached by solidified lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms termed chernobylite.<br/>11. It was concluded that there was no further risk of explosion.<br/>"
Doctor_Who-Charity_episodes,"Category: Tv<br/>Title: Doctor Who<br/>Section: Charity episodes<br/><br/>1. In 1983, coinciding with the series' 20th anniversary, a charity special titled ""The Five Doctors"" was produced in aid of Children in Need, featuring three of the first five Doctors, a new actor to replace the deceased William Hartnell, and unused footage to represent Tom Baker.<br/>2. This was a full-length, 90-minute film, the longest single episode of ""Doctor Who"" produced to date (the television movie ran slightly longer on broadcast where it included commercial breaks).In 1993, for the franchise's 30th anniversary, another charity special, titled ""Dimensions in Time"" was produced for Children in Need, featuring all of the surviving actors who played the Doctor and a number of previous companions.<br/>3. It also featured a crossover with the soap opera ""EastEnders"", the action taking place in the latter's Albert Square location and around Greenwich.<br/>4. The special was one of several special 3D programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system that made use of the Pulfrich effect requiring glasses with one darkened lens; the picture would look normal to those viewers who watched without the glasses.In 1999, another special, ""Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death"", was made for Comic Relief and later released on VHS.<br/>5. An affectionate parody of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional serial format, complete with cliffhangers, and running down the same corridor several times when being chased (the version released on video was split into only two episodes).<br/>6. In the story, the Doctor (Rowan Atkinson) encounters both the Master (Jonathan Pryce) and the Daleks.<br/>7. During the special the Doctor is forced to regenerate several times, with his subsequent incarnations played by, in order, Richard E. Grant, Jim Broadbent, Hugh Grant and Joanna Lumley.<br/>8. The script was written by Steven Moffat, later to be head writer and executive producer to the revived series.Since the return of ""Doctor Who"" in 2005, the franchise has produced two original ""mini-episodes"" to support Children in Need.<br/>9. The first, aired in November 2005, was an which introduced David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor.<br/>10. It was followed in November 2007 by ""Time Crash"", a 7-minute scene which featured the Tenth Doctor meeting the Fifth Doctor (played once again by Peter Davison).A set of two mini-episodes, titled ""Space"" and ""Time"" respectively, were produced to support Comic Relief.<br/>11. They were aired during the Comic Relief 2011 event.During 2011 Children in Need, an exclusively-filmed segment showed the Doctor addressing the viewer, attempting to persuade them to purchase items of his clothing, which were going up for auction for Children in Need.<br/>12.

Because of this favored position, the US asked the Baring firm to handle the transaction.<br/>4. Francis Baring's son Alexander was in Paris at the time and helped in the negotiations.<br/>5. Another Baring advantage was a close relationship with Hope and Company of Amsterdam.<br/>6. The two banking houses worked together to facilitate and underwrite the Purchase.<br/>7.

In many industries, this involved the application of technology developed in Britain in new places.<br/>3. Often the technology was purchased from Britain or British engineers and entrepreneurs moved abroad in search of new opportunities.<br/>4. By 1809 part of the Ruhr Valley in Westphalia was called 'Miniature England' because of its similarities to the industrial areas of England.<br/>5. The German, Russian and Belgian governments all provided state funding to the new industries.<br/>6.

Spain-Literature,"Category: Country<br/>Title: Spain<br/>Section: Literature<br/><br/>1. The earliest recorded examples of a vernacular Romance-based literature date from the same time and location, the rich mix of Muslim, Jewish, and Christian cultures in Muslim Spain, in which Maimonides, Averroes, and others worked, The Jarchas.During the Reconquista, the epic poem Cantar de Mio Cid was written about a real man—his battles, conquests, and daily life.Other major plays from the medival times were Mester de Juglaría, Mester de Clerecía, Coplas por la muerte de su padre or The Book of Good Love.During the Renaissance the major plays are La Celestina and El Lazarillo de Tormes, while many religious literature was created with poets as Luis de León, San Juan de la Cruz, Santa Teresa de Jesús, etc.The Baroque is the most important period for Spanish culture.<br/>2. We are in the times of the Spanish Empire.<br/>3. The famous Don Quijote de La Mancha by Miguel de Cervantes was written in this time.<br/>4. Other writers from the period are: Francisco de Quevedo, Lope de Vega, Calderón de la Barca or Tirso de Molina.During the Enlightenment we find names as Leandro Fernández de Moratín, Benito Jerónimo Feijóo, Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos or Leandro Fernández de Moratín.During the Romanticism, José Zorrilla created one of the most emblematic figures in European literature in Don Juan Tenorio.<br/>5. Other writers from this period are Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer, José de Espronceda, Rosalía de Castro or Mariano José de Larra.in the Realism we find names as Benito Pérez Galdós, Emilia Pardo Bazán, Leopoldo Alas (Clarín) or Vicente Blasco Ibáñez and Menéndez Pelayo.<br/>6. Realism offered depictions of contemporary life and society 'as they were'.<br/>7. In the spirit of general ""Realism,"" Realist authors opted for depictions of everyday and banal activities and experiences, instead of a romanticized or similarly stylized presentation.The Generation of 1898 The destruction of Spain's fleet in Cuba by U.S. gunboats in 1898 provoked a general cultural crisis in Spain.<br/>8. The ""Disaster"" of 1898 led established writers to seek practical political, economic, and social solutions in essays grouped under the literary heading of ""Regeneracionismo.""<br/>9. For a group of younger writers, among them Miguel de Unamuno, Pío Baroja, and José Martínez Ruiz (Azorín), the Disaster and its cultural repercussions inspired a deeper, more radical literary shift that affected both form and content.<br/>10. These writers, along with Ramón del Valle-Inclán, Antonio Machado, Ramiro de Maeztu, and Ángel Ganivet, came to be known as the 'Generation of 98.<br/>11. 'The Generation of 1914 or Novecentismo The next supposed “generation” of Spanish writers following those of ´98 already calls into question the value of such terminology.<br/>12. By the year 1914—the year of the outbreak of the First World War and of the publication of the first major work of the generation's leading voice, José Ortega y Gasset—a number of slightly younger writers had established their own place within the Spanish cultural field.<br/>13. Leading voices include the poet Juan Ramón Jiménez, the academics and essayists Ramón Menéndez Pidal, Gregorio Marañon, Manuel Azaña, Eugeni d'Ors, and Ortega y Gasset, and the novelists Gabriel Miró, Ramón Pérez de Ayala, and Ramón Gómez de la Serna.<br/>14. While still driven by the national and existential questions that obsessed the writers of ´98, they approached these topics with a greater sense of distance and objectivity.The Generation of 1927, where poets Pedro Salinas, Jorge Guillén, Federico García Lorca, Vicente Aleixandre, Dámaso Alonso.<br/>15. All were scholars of their national literary heritage, again evidence of the impact of the calls of “Regeneracionistas” and the Generation of 1898 for Spanish intelligence to turn at least partially inwards.The two main writers in the second half of the 20th century were the Nobel Prize in Literature laureate Camilo José Cela and Miguel Delibes.<br/>16. Spain is one of the countries with the most number of laureates with the Nobel Prize in Literature, and with latinamerican laureates they made the spanish language literature one of the most laureates of all.<br/>17.

Popcorn-Abstract,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Popcorn<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. Popcorn, also known as popping corn, is a type of corn (maize, ""Zea mays var.<br/>2. everta"") that expands from the kernel and puffs up when heated.<br/>3. Popcorn is able to pop because, like amaranth grain, sorghum, quinoa, and millet, its kernels have a hard moisture-sealed hull and a dense starchy interior.<br/>4. Pressure builds inside the kernel, and a small explosion (or ""pop"") is the end result.<br/>5. Some strains of corn are now cultivated specifically as popping corns.There are various techniques for popping corn.<br/>6. Along with prepackaged popcorn, which is generally intended to be prepared in a microwave oven, there are small home appliances for popping corn.<br/>7. These methods require the use of minimally processed popping corn.A larger-scale, commercial popcorn machine was invented by Charles Cretors in the late 19th century.Unpopped popcorn is considered nonperishable and will last indefinitely if stored in ideal conditions.Depending on how it is prepared and cooked, some consider popcorn to be a health food, while others caution against it for a variety of reasons.<br/>8. Popcorn can also have non-food applications, ranging from holiday decorations to packaging materials.<br/>"

Ramen soup is generally made from stock based on chicken or pork, combined with a variety of ingredients such as kombu (kelp), katsuobushi (skipjack tuna flakes), niboshi (dried baby sardines), beef bones, shiitake, and onions, and then flavored with salt, miso, or soy sauce.<br/>2. Other styles that have emerged later on include curry ramen and other flavors.The resulting combination is generally divided into four categories (although new and original variations often make this categorisation less clear-cut):<br/>3. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shio (""salt"") ramen is probably the oldest of the four and is a pale, clear, yellowish broth made with plenty of salt and any combination of chicken, vegetables, fish, and seaweed.<br/>4. Occasionally pork bones are also used, but they are not boiled as long as they are for ""tonkotsu"" ramen, so the soup remains light and clear.<br/>5. Chāshū is sometimes swapped for lean chicken meatballs, and pickled plums and kamaboko (a slice of processed fish roll sometimes served as a frilly white circle with a pink or red spiral called narutomaki) are popular toppings as well.<br/>6. Noodle texture and thickness varies among ""shio"" ramen, but they are usually straight rather than curly.<br/>7. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (豚骨, ""pork bone""; not to be confused with tonkatsu) ramen usually has a cloudy white colored broth.<br/>8. It is similar to the Chinese ""baitang"" (白湯) and has a thick broth made from boiling pork bones, fat, and collagen over high heat for many hours, which suffuses the broth with a hearty pork flavor and a creamy consistency that rivals milk, melted butter or gravy (depending on the shop).<br/>9. Most shops, but not all, blend this pork broth with a small amount of chicken and vegetable stock and/or soy sauce.<br/>10. The noodles are thin and straight, and it is often served with beni shoga (pickled ginger).<br/>11. In recent years the latest trend in ""tonkotsu"" toppings is ""māyu"" (sesame oil), a blackish, aromatic oil made from either charred crushed garlic or Sesame seeds.<br/>12. It is a specialty of Kyushu, particularly Hakata-ku, Fukuoka (hence sometimes called ""Hakata ramen"").<br/>13. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shōyu (""soy sauce"") ramen typically has a clear brown broth, based on a chicken and vegetable (or sometimes fish or beef) stock with plenty of soy sauce added resulting in a soup that is tangy, salty, and savory yet still fairly light on the palate.<br/>14. Shōyu ramen usually has curly noodles rather than straight ones, but this is not always the case.<br/>15. It is often adorned with marinated bamboo shoots or ""menma"", green onions, ""kamaboko"" (fish cakes), ""nori"" (seaweed), boiled eggs, bean sprouts and/or black pepper; occasionally the soup will also contain chili oil or Chinese spices, and some shops serve sliced beef instead of the usual chāshū.<br/>16. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miso ramen is a relative newcomer, having reached national prominence around 1965.<br/>17. This uniquely Japanese ramen, which was developed in Hokkaido, features a broth that combines copious amounts of miso and is blended with oily chicken or fish broth – and sometimes with ""tonkotsu"" or lard – to create a thick, nutty, slightly sweet and very hearty soup.<br/>18. Miso ramen broth tends to have a robust, tangy flavor, so it stands up to a variety of flavorful toppings: spicy bean paste or ""tōbanjan"" (豆瓣醤), butter and corn, leeks, onions, bean sprouts, ground pork, cabbage, sesame seeds, white pepper, and chopped garlic are common.<br/>19. The noodles are typically thick, curly, and slightly chewy.<br/><br/>20. Seasonings commonly added to ramen are black pepper, butter, chili pepper, sesame seeds, and crushed garlic.</br>21. Soup recipes and methods of preparation tend to be closely guarded secrets.Some restaurants also offer a system known as ""kae-dama"" (替え玉), where customers who have finished their noodles can request a ""refill"" (for a few hundred yen more) to be put into their remaining soup.<br/>"
France-Music,"Category: Country<br/>Title: France<br/>Section: Music<br/><br/>1. France has a long and varied musical history.<br/>2. It experienced a golden age in the 17th century thanks to Louis XIV, who employed several musicians and composers in the royal court.<br/>3. The most renowned composers of this period include Marc-Antoine Charpentier, François Couperin, Michel-Richard Delalande, Jean-Baptiste Lully and Marin Marais, all of them composers at the court.<br/>4. After the death of the ""Roi Soleil"", French musical creation lost dynamism, but in the next century the music of Jean-Philippe Rameau reached some prestige, and today he is still one of the most renowned French composers.French classical music knew a revival in the 19th and 20th century, at the end of the romantic movement, at first with opera composers Hector Berlioz, Georges Bizet, Gabriel Fauré, Charles Gounod, Jacques Offenbach, Édouard Lalo, Jules Massenet and Camille Saint-Saëns.<br/>5. This period was a golden age for operas, being popular in the country the opéra bouffon, the opera-ballet and the opéra comique genres.<br/>6. Later came precursors of modern classical music Érik Satie, Francis Poulenc, and above all Maurice Ravel and Claude Debussy, who invented new musical forms.<br/>7. More recently, at the middle of the 20th century, Maurice Ohana, Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Boulez contributed to the evolutions of contemporary classical music.French music then followed the rapid emergence of pop and rock music at the middle of the 20th century.<br/>8. Although English-speaking creations achieved popularity in the country, French pop music, known as ""chanson française"", has also remained very popular.<br/>9. Among the most important French artists of the century are Édith Piaf, Georges Brassens, Léo Ferré, Charles Aznavour and Serge Gainsbourg.<br/>10. Although there are very few rock bands in France compared to English-speaking countries, bands such as Noir Désir, Mano Negra, Niagara, Les Rita Mitsouko and more recently Superbus, Phoenix and Gojira have reached worldwide popularity.Other French artists with international careers have been popular in several countries, for example female singers Dalida, Mireille Mathieu and Mylène Farmer, electronic music pioneers Jean-Michel Jarre, Laurent Garnier and Bob Sinclar, and later Martin Solveig and David Guetta.<br/>11. In the 1990s and 2000s (decade), electronic duos Daft Punk, Justice and Air also reached worldwide popularity and contributed to the reputation of modern electronic music in the world.Among current musical events and institutions in France, many are dedicated to classical music and operas.<br/>12. The most prestigious institutions are the state-owned Paris National Opera (with its two sites Palais Garnier and Opéra Bastille), the Opéra National de Lyon, the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris, the Théâtre du Capitole in Toulouse and the Grand Théâtre de Bordeaux.<br/>13. As for music festivals, there are several events organized, the most popular being the Eurockéennes and Rock en Seine.<br/>14. The Fête de la Musique, imitated by many foreign cities, was first launched by the French government in 1982.<br/>15. Major music halls and venues in France include Le Zénith sites present in many cities and other places in Paris (Paris Olympia, Théâtre Mogador, Élysée Montmartre, etc.<br/>16. ).<br/>"

Volleyball-Origin_of_volleyball,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Volleyball<br/>Section: Origin of volleyball<br/><br/>1. History.Origin of volleyball.On February 9, 1895, in Holyoke, Massachusetts (USA), William G. Morgan, a YMCA physical education director, created a new game called ""Mintonette"" as a pastime to be played (preferably) indoors and by any number of players.<br/>2. The game took some of its characteristics from tennis and handball.<br/>3. Another indoor sport, basketball, was catching on in the area, having been invented just ten miles (sixteen kilometers) away in the city of Springfield, Massachusetts, only four years before.<br/>4. Mintonette was designed to be an indoor sport, less rough than basketball, for older members of the YMCA, while still requiring a bit of athletic effort.The first rules, written down by William G Morgan, called for a net high, a court, and any number of players.<br/>5. A match was composed of nine innings with three serves for each team in each inning, and no limit to the number of ball contacts for each team before sending the ball to the opponents’ court.<br/>6. In case of a serving error, a second try was allowed.<br/>7. Hitting the ball into the net was considered a foul (with loss of the point or a side-out)—except in the case of the first-try serve.After an observer, Alfred Halstead, noticed the volleying nature of the game at its first exhibition match in 1896, played at the International YMCA Training School (now called Springfield College), the game quickly became known as ""volleyball"" (it was originally spelled as two words: """"volley ball"""").<br/>8. Volleyball rules were slightly modified by the International YMCA Training School and the game spread around the country to various YMCAs.<br/>"
Nigeria-Crime,"Category: Country<br/>Title: Nigeria<br/>Section: Crime<br/><br/>1. Nigeria is home to a substantial network of organised crime, active especially in drug trafficking.Nigerian criminal groups are heavily involved in drug trafficking, shipping heroin from Asian countries to Europe and America; and cocaine from South America to Europe and South Africa.<br/>2. .The various Nigerian Confraternities or ""campus cults"" are active in both organised crime and in political violence as well as providing a network of corruption within Nigeria.<br/>3. As confraternities have extensive connections with political and military figures, they offer excellent alumni networking opportunities.<br/>4. The Supreme Vikings Confraternity, for example, boasts that twelve members of the Rivers State House of Assembly are cult members.On lower levels of society, there are the ""area boys"", organised gangs mostly active in Lagos who specialise in mugging and small-scale drug dealing.<br/>5. According to official statistics, gang violence in Lagos resulted in 273 civilians and 84 policemen killed in the period of August 2000 to May 2001.Internationally, Nigeria is infamous for a form of bank fraud dubbed ""419"", a type of advance fee fraud (named after Section 419 of the Nigerian Penal Code) along with the ""Nigerian scam"", a form of confidence trick practised by individuals and criminal syndicates.<br/>6. These scams involve a complicit Nigerian bank (the laws being set up loosely to allow it) and a scammer who claims to have money he needs to obtain from that bank.<br/>7. The victim is talked into exchanging bank account information on the premise that the money will be transferred to him, and then he'll get to keep a cut.<br/>8. In reality, money is taken out instead, and/or large fees (which seem small in comparison with the imaginary wealth he awaits) are deducted.<br/>9. In 2003, the Nigerian Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (or EFCC) was created, ostensibly to combat this and other forms of organised financial crime.<br/>10. There is also some piracy in Nigeria, with attacks mainly directed at smaller ships shuttling employees and materials belonging to the oil companies with any involvement in oil exploration in the Niger Delta.<br/>11. From 1 January 2007 to 29 October 2007, twenty-six pirate attacks were recorded.Nigeria is also pervaded by political corruption.<br/>12. It is ranked 143 out of 182 countries in Transparency International's 2011 Corruption Perceptions Index.<br/>13. More than $400 billion was stolen from the treasury by Nigeria's leaders between 1960 and 1999.<br/>"
Cloning-Cloning_extinct_and_endangered_species,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Cloning<br/>Section: Cloning extinct and endangered species<br/><br/>1.  extinct and endangered species.Cloning, or more precisely, the reconstruction of functional DNA from extinct species has, for decades, been a dream of some scientists.<br/>2. Current cloning techniques have an average success rate of less than 5 percent, even when working with familiar species; cloning wild animals is usually less than 1 percent successful.<br/>3. The possible implications of this were dramatized in the best-selling novel by Michael Crichton and high budget Hollywood thriller ""Jurassic Park"".<br/>4. Early hopes to save species through cloning have been dashed as the difficulties of cloning any species have made progress very slow.<br/>5. Several tissue banks have come into existence, including the ""Frozen Zoo"" at the San Diego Zoo, to store frozen tissue from the world's rarest and most endangered species.In 2001, a cow named Bessie gave birth to a cloned Asian gaur, an endangered species, but the calf died after two days.<br/>6. In 2003, a banteng was successfully cloned, followed by three African wildcats from a thawed frozen embryo.<br/>7. These successes provided hope that similar techniques (using surrogate mothers of another species) might be used to clone extinct species.<br/>8. Anticipating this possibility, tissue samples from the last ""bucardo"" (Pyrenean Ibex) were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after it died in 2000.<br/>9. Researchers are also considering cloning endangered species such as the giant panda and cheetah.In 2002, geneticists at the Australian Museum announced that they had replicated DNA of the Thylacine (Tasmanian Tiger), at the time extinct for about 65 years, using polymerase chain reaction.<br/>10. However, on February 15, 2005 the museum announced that it was stopping the project after tests showed the specimens' DNA had been too badly degraded by the (ethanol) preservative.<br/>11. On 15 May 2005 it was announced that the Thylacine project would be revived, with new participation from researchers in New South Wales and Victoria.In January 2009, for the first time, an extinct animal, the Pyrenean ibex mentioned above was cloned, at the Centre of Food Technology and Research of Aragon, using the preserved DNA of the skin samples from 2001 and domestic goat egg-cells.<br/>12. The ibex died shortly after birth due to physical defects in its lungs.One of the most anticipated targets for cloning was once the Woolly Mammoth, but attempts to extract DNA from frozen mammoths have been unsuccessful, though a joint Russo-Japanese team is currently working toward this goal.<br/>13. In January 2011, it was reported by Yomiuri Shimbun that a team of scientists headed by Akira Iritani of Kyoto University had built upon research by Dr. Wakayama, saying that they will extract DNA from a mammoth carcass that had been preserved in a Russian laboratory and insert it into the egg cells of an African elephant in hopes of producing a mammoth embryo.<br/>14. The researchers said they hoped to produce a baby mammoth within six years.Scientists at the University of Newcastle and University of New South Wales announced in March 2013 that the very recently extinct gastric-brooding frog would be the subject of a cloning attempt to resurrect the species.<br/>"
Cheese-World_production_and_consumption,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Cheese<br/>Section: World production and consumption<br/><br/>1. Worldwide, cheese is a major agricultural product.<br/>2. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, over 20 million metric tons of cheese were produced worldwide in 2011.<br/>3. This is about three kilograms for each person on Earth.<br/>4. The largest producer of cheese is the United States, accounting for 26% of world production, followed by Germany and France.<br/>5. In the U.S., mozzarella and cheddar are by far the top cheese types.<br/>6. Only Ireland, New Zealand, the Netherlands and Australia have a cheese production that is mainly export oriented: respectively 95%, 90%, 72%, and 65% of their cheese production is exported.<br/>7. Only 35% of French production is exported.<br/>8. The United States, the biggest world producer of cheese, is a marginal exporter, as most of its production is for the domestic market.Emmental (used mainly as a cooking ingredient) and Camembert are the most common cheeses in France.<br/>9. In Iceland, skyr is the most common cheese.<br/>10. In Greece, feta accounts for three-quarters of this consumption.<br/>11. In the U.S., the consumption of cheese is quickly increasing and has nearly tripled between 1970 and 2003.<br/>12. The consumption per person has reached, in 2003, .<br/>13. Mozzarella is United States's favorite cheese and accounts for nearly a third of its consumption, mainly because it is one of the main ingredients of pizza.<br/>"

Project Mercury (1959–63).Shortly after the Space Race began, an early objective was to get a person into Earth orbit as soon as possible, therefore the simplest spacecraft that could be launched by existing rockets was favored.<br/>2. U.S. Air Force's Man in Space Soonest program looked at many manned spacecraft designs, ranging from rocket planes like the X-15, to small ballistic space capsules.<br/>3. By 1958, the space plane concepts were eliminated in favor of the ballistic capsule.When NASA was created that same year, the Air Force program was transferred to it and renamed ""Project Mercury"".<br/>4. The first seven astronauts were selected among candidates from the Navy, Air Force and Marine test pilot programs.<br/>5. On May 5, 1961, astronaut Alan Shepard became the first American in space aboard ""Freedom 7"", launched by a Redstone booster on a 15-minute ballistic (suborbital) flight.<br/>6. John Glenn became the first American to be launched into orbit by an Atlas launch vehicle on February 20, 1962 aboard ""Friendship 7"".<br/>7. Glenn completed three orbits, after which three more orbital flights were made, culminating in L. Gordon Cooper's 22-orbit flight ""Faith 7"", May 15–16, 1963.The Soviet Union (USSR) competed with its own single-pilot spacecraft, Vostok.<br/>8. They beat the U.S. for the first man in space, by launching cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into a single Earth orbit aboard Vostok 1 in April 1961, one month before Shepard's flight.<br/>9. In August 1962, they achieved an almost four-day record flight with Andriyan Nikolayev aboard Vostok 3, and also conducted a concurrent Vostok 4 mission carrying Pavel Popovich.<br/>"

Pakistan is a federation of four provinces: Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, as well as the Islamabad Capital Territory and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in the northwest, which include the Frontier Regions.<br/>2. The government of Pakistan exercises ""de facto"" jurisdiction over the western parts of the disputed Kashmir region, organised into the separate political entities Azad Kashmir and Gilgit–Baltistan (formerly Northern Areas).<br/>3. The ""Gilgit–Baltistan Empowerment and Self-Governance Order"" of 2009 assigned a province-like status to the latter, giving it self-government.Local government follows a three-tier system of districts, tehsils and union councils, with an elected body at each tier.<br/>4. There are about 130 districts altogether, of which Azad Kashmir has ten and Gilgit–Baltistan seven.<br/>5. The Tribal Areas comprise seven tribal agencies and six small frontier regions detached from neighbouring districts.Law enforcement in Pakistan is carried out by federal and provincial police agencies.<br/>6. The four provinces and the Islamabad Capital Territory each have a civilian police force with jurisdiction limited to the relevant province or territory.<br/>7. At the federal level, there are a number of civilian agencies with nationwide jurisdictions; including the Federal Investigation Agency, the National Highways and Motorway Police, and several paramilitary forces such as the Pakistan Rangers and the Frontier Corps.The court system of Pakistan is organised as a hierarchy, with the Supreme Court at the apex, below which are High Courts, Federal Shariat Courts (one in each province and one in the federal capital), District Courts (one in each district), Judicial Magistrate Courts (in every town and city), Executive Magistrate Courts and Civil Courts.<br/>8. Pakistan's penal code has limited jurisdiction in the Tribal Areas, where law is largely derived from tribal customs.<br/>"

It incorporates kicks, punches, knees and elbow strikes in a ring with gloves similar to those used in Western boxing and this has led to Thailand gaining medals at the Olympic Games in boxing.Takraw (Thai: ตะกร้อ) is a sport native to Thailand, which the players hit a rattan ball and only be allowed to use their feet, knees, chest and head to touch the ball.<br/>4. Sepak takraw is a form of this sport which appears in volleyball style, the players must volley a ball over a net and force it to hit the ground on opponent's side.<br/>5. It is a popular in other countries in Southeast Asia also.<br/>6. A rather similar game but played only with the feet is Buka ball.Rugby is also a growing sport in Thailand with the Thailand national rugby union team rising to be ranked 61st in the world.<br/>7. Thailand became the first country in the world to host an international 80 kg welterweight rugby tournament in 2005.<br/>8. The national domestic Thailand Rugby Union (TRU) competition includes several universities and services teams such as Chulalongkorn University, Mahasarakham University, Kasetsart University, Prince of Songkla University, Thammasat University, Rangsit University, the Thai Police, the Thai Army, the Thai Navy and the Royal Thai Air Force.<br/>9. Local sports clubs which also compete in the TRU include the British Club of Bangkok, the Southerners Sports Club (Bangkok) and the Royal Bangkok Sports Club.Thailand has been called the Golf Capital of Asia as it is a popular destination for golf.<br/>10. The country attracts a large number of golfers from Japan, Korea, Singapore, South Africa and Western countries who come to play golf in Thailand every year.<br/>11. The growing popularity of golf, especially among the middle classes and expats, is evident since there are more than 200 world-class golf courses nationwide, and some of them are chosen to host PGA and LPGA tournaments, such as Amata Spring Country Club, Alpine Golf & Sports Club, Thai Country Club and Black Mountain Golf Club.Basketball is also a growing sport in Thailand, especially on the professional sports club level.<br/>12. The Chang Thailand Slammers won the 2011 Asean Basketball League Championship.<br/>13. The Thailand national basketball team had its most successful year at the 1966 Asian Games where it won the silver medal.Other sports in Thailand are slowly growing as the country develops its sporting infrastructure.<br/>14.

Grand_Canyon-Activities,"Category: Travel<br/>Title: Grand Canyon<br/>Section: Activities<br/><br/>1. Aside from casual sightseeing from the South Rim (averaging 7,000 feet [2,100 m] above sea level), rafting, hiking, running and helicopter tours are especially popular.<br/>2. The Grand Canyon Ultra Marathon is a race over 24 hours.<br/>3. The floor of the valley is accessible by foot, muleback, or by boat or raft from upriver.<br/>4. Hiking down to the river and back up to the rim in one day is discouraged by park officials because of the distance, steep and rocky trails, change in elevation, and danger of heat exhaustion from the much higher temperatures at the bottom.<br/>5. Rescues are required annually of unsuccessful rim-to-river-to-rim travelers.<br/>6. Nevertheless, hundreds of fit and experienced hikers complete the trip every year.Camping on the North and South Rims is generally restricted to established campgrounds and reservations are highly recommended, especially at the busier South Rim.<br/>7. There is at large camping available along many parts of the North Rim managed by Kaibab National Forest.<br/>8. North Rim campsites are only open seasonally due to road closures from weather and winter snowpack.<br/>9. All overnight camping below the rim requires a backcountry permit from the Backcountry Office (BCO).<br/>10. Each year Grand Canyon National Park receives approximately 30,000 requests for backcountry permits.<br/>11. The park issues 13,000 permits, and close to 40,000 people camp overnight.<br/>12. The earliest a permit application is accepted is the first of the month, four months before the proposed start month.Tourists wishing for a more vertical perspective can board helicopters and small airplanes in Las Vegas, Phoenix and Grand Canyon National Park Airport (seven miles from the South Rim) for canyon flyovers.<br/>13. Scenic flights are no longer allowed to fly within 1500 feet of the rim within the national park because of a late 1990s crash.<br/>14. The last aerial video footage from below the rim was filmed in 1984.<br/>15. However, some helicopter flights land on the Havasupai and Hualapai Indian Reservations within Grand Canyon (outside of the park boundaries).<br/>16. Recently, the Hualapai Tribe opened the glass-bottomed Grand Canyon Skywalk on their property, Grand Canyon West.<br/>17. The Skywalk has seen mixed reviews since the site is only accessible by driving down a dirt road, costs a minimum of $85 in total for reservation fees, a tour package and admission to the Skywalk itself and the fact that cameras or other personal equipment are not permitted on the Skywalk at any time due to the hazard of damaging the glass if dropped.<br/>18. The Skywalk is about by road from Grand Canyon Village at the South Rim.<br/>"
Anatomy-Vertebrate_anatomy,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Anatomy<br/>Section: Vertebrate anatomy<br/><br/>1. All vertebrates are built along the basic chordate body plan: a stiff rod running through the length of the animal (vertebral column or notochord), with a hollow tube of nervous tissue, the spinal cord above it and the gastrointestinal tract below.<br/>2. Nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm, connective tissues are derived from mesoderm, and gut is derived from the endoderm.<br/>3. At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut.<br/>4. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the anus at the base of the tail.<br/>5. The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column, in which the notochord has been replaced by a segmented series of stiffer elements (vertebrae) separated by mobile joints (intervertebral discs), which each contain a soft central core (nucleus pulposus), derived from the notochord of the embryo.<br/>6. However, a few vertebrates have secondarily lost this anatomy, retaining the notochord into adulthood.<br/>7. These include the sturgeon and the coelacanth.<br/>8. Jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost.<br/>9. The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor.<br/>10. This is one of the arguments put forward by Charles Darwin to support his theory of evolution.<br/>"
Amélie-Production,"Category: Movies<br/>Title: Amélie<br/>Section: Production<br/><br/>1. In his DVD commentary, Jeunet explains that he originally wrote the role of Amélie for the English actress Emily Watson; in the original draft, Amélie's father was an Englishman living in London.<br/>2. However, Watson's French was not strong, and when she became unavailable to shoot the film, owing to a conflict with the filming of ""Gosford Park"", Jeunet rewrote the screenplay for a French actress.<br/>3. Audrey Tautou was the first actress he auditioned having seen her on the poster for ""Venus Beauty Institute"".The movie was filmed mainly in Paris.<br/>4. The Café des 2 Moulins (15 Rue Lepic, Montmartre, Paris) where Amélie works is a real place.The filmmakers made use of computer-generated imagery and a digital intermediate.<br/>5.

Mona_Lisa-Title_and_subject,"Category: Art<br/>Title: Mona Lisa<br/>Section: Title and subject<br/><br/>1. The title of the painting that is known in English as Mona Lisa stems from a description by Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari, who wrote """"Leonardo undertook to paint, for Francesco del Giocondo, the portrait of Mona Lisa, his wife"".""<br/>2. ""Mona"" in Italian is a polite form of address originating as ""ma donna"" —similar to ""Ma’am"", ""Madam"", or ""my lady"" in English.This became ""madonna"", and its contraction ""mona"".<br/>3. The title of the painting, though traditionally spelled ""Mona"" (as used by Vasari), is also commonly spelled in modern Italian as ""Monna Lisa"", but this is rare in English.Vasari's account of the ""Mona Lisa"" comes from his biography of Leonardo published in 1550, 31 years after the artist's death, and which has long been the best known source of information on the provenance of the work and identity of the sitter.<br/>4. Leonardo's assistant Salaì, at his death in 1525, owned a portrait which in his personal papers was named ""la Gioconda"", a painting bequeathed to him by Leonardo.<br/>5. That Leonardo painted such a work, and its date, were confirmed in 2005 when a scholar at Heidelberg University discovered a marginal note in a 1477 printing of a volume written by the ancient Roman philosopher Cicero.<br/>6. The note is dated October 1503 and was written by Leonardo's contemporary Agostino Vespucci.<br/>7. This note likens Leonardo to renowned Greek painter Apelles, who is mentioned in the text, and states that Leonardo was at that time working on a painting of Lisa del Giocondo.The sitter, Lisa del Giocondo,was a member of the Gherardini family of Florence and Tuscany, and the wife of wealthy Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo.The painting is thought to have been commissioned for their new home, and to celebrate the birth of their second son, Andrea.<br/>8. The Italian name for the painting, ""La Gioconda"", means ""jocund"" (""happy"" or ""jovial""), or literally ""the jocund one"", a pun on the feminine form of the sitter's married name ""Giocondo"".<br/>9. In French, the title ""La Joconde"" has the same meaning.Over the years there have been several alternative views among scholars as to the subject of the painting.<br/>10. Some have argued that Lisa del Giocondo was the subject of a different portrait, identifying at least four other paintings as the ""Mona Lisa"" referred to by Vasari.Several other individuals have been proposed as the subject of the painting.Isabella of Aragon, Cecilia Gallerani, Costanza d'Avalos, Duchess of Francavilla, Isabella d'Este, Pacifica Brandano or Brandino, Isabela Gualanda, Caterina Sforza, —even Salaì and Leonardo himself— are all among the list of posited models portrayed in the painting.Currently, the consensus of art historians is that the painting depicts Lisa del Giocondo, which has always been the traditional view.<br/>"
Fencing-Universities_and_schools,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Fencing<br/>Section: Universities and schools<br/><br/>1. Fencing has a long history with universities and schools for at least 500 years.<br/>2. At least one style of fencing, Mensur in Germany, is practiced only within universities.<br/>3. University students compete internationally at the World University Games.<br/>4. The United States holds two national level university tournaments including the NCAA championship and the USACFC National Championships tournaments in the USA and the BUCS fencing championships in the United Kingdom.Equipment costs and the relatively small scale of the sport limits university fencing to a small number of schools.<br/>5. National fencing organizations have set up programs to encourage more students to fence.<br/>6. Examples include the Regional Youth Circuit program in the USA and the Leon Paul Youth Development series in the UK.In recent years, attempts have been made to introduce fencing to a wider and younger audience, by using foam and plastic swords, which require much less protective equipment.<br/>7. This makes it much less expensive to provide classes, and makes it easier to take fencing to a wider range of schools than traditionally has been the case.<br/>8. There is even a competition series in Scotland – the Plastic-and-Foam Fencing FunLeague – specifically for Primary and early Secondary school-age children using this equipment.The UK hosts two national competitions in which schools compete against each other directly: the Public Schools Fencing Championship, a competition only open to Independent Schools, and the Scottish Secondary Schools Championships, open to all secondary schools in Scotland.<br/>9. It contains both teams and individual events and is highly anticipated.<br/>10. Schools organise matches directly against one another and school age pupils can compete individually in the British Youth Championships.Many universities in Ontario, Canada have fencing teams that participate in an annual inter-university competition called the OUA Finals.<br/>"
Gangnam_Style-Music_industry,"Category: Music<br/>Title: Gangnam Style<br/>Section: Music industry<br/><br/>1. Record executives in the music industry believe that music charts will increasingly be filled with YouTube-driven globalised acts from foreign countries.<br/>2. Sean Carey, a research fellow in the School of Social Sciences at the University of Roehampton, wrote that the flow of popular music will no longer be a single traffic route from North America and Europe to other parts of the globe, but will also move the other way as well.<br/>3. According to Adam Sherwin from ""The Independent"", the global web demand for Gangnam Style had short-circuited the ""traditional reluctance"" of radio stations to play foreign-language songs.<br/>4. The song is also underlining a shift in how money is being made in the music business.<br/>5. Although Psy earned more than US$60,000 from music sales of ""Gangnam Style"" in South Korea alone, he and his music label YG Entertainment have raked in almost US$1 million from advertisements which appear on YouTube videos identified for using ""Gangnam Style"" in its content.<br/>6. The ""Harvard Business Review"" published an article written by Kevin Evers, who explained how ""Gangnam Style"" had changed Billboard's ranking methodology of its music charts.<br/>7. Instead of relying solely on radio plays and paid purchases, Billboard started to place a heavier emphasis on digital sales and YouTube views.<br/>8. As a result of the change, Gangnam Style moved up to the top position of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs music chart.<br/>9. According to the British Phonographic Industry's report based on Official Charts Company sales data, thanks to Psy's song and Carly Rae Jepsen’s ""Call Me Maybe,"" pop became the UK’s favourite musical genre of the year, taking the lion’s share of the singles market (38.5%) in 2012.<br/>"

Egypt-Museums,"Category: Country<br/>Title: Egypt<br/>Section: Museums<br/><br/>1. Egypt has one of the oldest civilizations in the world.<br/>2. Thus, it has been in contact with many other civilizations and nations and also has been through so many eras, starting from pre-historic age to the modern age, passing through so many ages such as; Pharonic, Roman, Greek, Islamic and many other ages.<br/>3. Because of this wide variation of ages, the continuous contact with other nations and the big number of conflicts Egypt had been through, at least 60 museums may be found in Egypt, mainly covering a wide area of these ages and conflicts.The Three main museums in Egypt are; The Egyptian Museum which has more than 120,000 items, the Egyptian National Military Museum and the 6th of October Panorama.The Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM), also known as the Giza Museum, is a planned museum of artifacts of ancient Egypt.<br/>4.

Vietnam_War-American_nurses,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Vietnam War<br/>Section: American nurses<br/><br/>1. Women in the Vietnam War.American nurses.During the Vietnam War, American women served on active duty doing a variety of jobs.<br/>2. Early in 1963, the Army Nurse Corps (ANC) launched Operation Nightingale, an intensive effort to recruit nurses to serve in Vietnam.<br/>3. Most nurses who volunteered to serve in Vietnam came from predominantly working or middle-class families with histories of military service.<br/>4. The majority of these women were white Catholics and Protestants.<br/>5. Because the need for medical aid was great, many nurses underwent a concentrated four-month training program before being deployed to Vietnam in the ANC.<br/>6. Due to the shortage of staff, nurses usually worked twelve-hour shifts, six days per week and often suffered from exhaustion.<br/>7. First Lieutenant Sharon Lane was the only female military nurse to be killed by enemy gunfire during the war, on 8 June 1969.At the start of the Vietnam War, it was commonly thought that American women had no place in the military.<br/>8. Their traditional place had been in the domestic sphere, but with the war came opportunity for the expansion of gender roles.<br/>9. In Vietnam, women held a variety of jobs which included operating complex data processing equipment and serving as stenographers.<br/>10. Although a small number of women were assigned to combat zones, they were never allowed directly in the field of battle.<br/>11. The women who served in the military were solely volunteers.<br/>12. They faced a plethora of challenges, one of which was the relatively small number of female soldiers.<br/>13. Living in a male-dominated environment created tensions between the sexes.<br/>14. While this high male to female ratio was often uncomfortable for women, many men reported that having women in the field with them boosted their morale.<br/>15. Although this was not the women's purpose, it was one positive result of the their service.<br/>16. By 1973, approximately 7,500 women had served in Vietnam in the Southeast Asian theater.<br/>17. In that same year, the military lifted the prohibition on women entering the armed forces.American women serving in Vietnam were subject to societal stereotypes.<br/>18. Many Americans either considered females serving in Vietnam masculine for living under the army discipline, or judged them to be women of questionable moral character who enlisted for the sole purpose of seducing men.<br/>19. To address this problem, the ANC released advertisements portraying women in the ANC as ""proper, professional and well protected.""<br/>20. (26) This effort to highlight the positive aspects of a nursing career reflected the ideas of second-wave feminism that occurred during the 1960s–1970s in the United States.<br/>21. Although female military nurses lived in a heavily male environment, very few cases of sexual harassment were ever reported.<br/>22. In 2008, by contrast, approximately one-third of women in the military felt that they had been sexually harassed compared with one-third of men.<br/>"
The_Lion_King-Abstract,"Category: Movies<br/>Title: The Lion King<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. The Lion King is a 1994 American animated musical adventure film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures.<br/>2. It is the 32nd animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series.<br/>3. The story takes place in a kingdom of lions in Africa, and was influenced by the biblical tales of Joseph and Moses and the Shakespeare play ""Hamlet"".<br/>4. The film was produced during a period known as the Disney Renaissance.<br/>5. ""The Lion King"" was directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff, produced by Don Hahn, and has a screenplay credited to Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts and Linda Woolverton.<br/>6. The film features a large ensemble voice cast led by Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Moira Kelly.<br/>7. It tells the story of Simba, a young lion who is to succeed his father, Mufasa, as king; however, after Simba's uncle Scar murders Mufasa, Simba is fooled into thinking he was responsible and flees into exile in shame and despair.<br/>8. Upon maturation living with two wastrels, Simba is given some valuable perspective from his friend, Nala, and his shaman, Rafiki, before returning to challenge Scar to end his tyranny.Development of ""The Lion King"" began in 1988 during a meeting between Jeffrey Katzenberg, Roy E. Disney and Peter Schneider while promoting ""Oliver & Company"" in Europe.<br/>9. Thomas Disch wrote a film treatment, and Woolverton developed the first scripts while George Scribner was signed on as director, being later joined by Allers.<br/>10. Production began in 1991, with most of the animators inexperienced or uninterested in animals as most of the Disney team wanted to work on ""Pocahontas"" instead.<br/>11. Some time after the staff traveled to Hell's Gate National Park to research on the film's setting and animals, Scribner left production disagreeing with the decision to turn the film into a musical, and was replaced by Minkoff.<br/>12. When Hahn joined the project, he was dissatisfied with the script and the story was promptly rewritten.<br/>13. Nearly 20 minutes of animation sequences took place at Disney-MGM Studios in Florida.<br/>14. Computer animation was also used in several scenes, most notably in the wildebeest stampede scene.<br/>15. ""The Lion King"" was released on June 15, 1994 to a positive reaction from critics, who praised the film for its music and story.<br/>16. Following a 3D re-release in 2011, with earnings of over US$987 million worldwide as of 2011, the film is the highest-grossing hand-drawn film in history, the highest-grossing 2D animated film in the United States and the 19th-highest-grossing feature film of all time.<br/>17. ""The Lion King"" garnered two Academy Awards for its achievement in music and the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.<br/>18. Its songs were written by composer Elton John and lyricist Tim Rice, with an original score by Hans Zimmer.<br/>19. The film lead to many derived works, such as a Broadway adaptation, two direct-to-video follow-ups - sequel """" (1998) and the prequel/parallel ""The Lion King 1½"" (2004) - and spin-off series ""Timon and Pumbaa"".<br/>"

In a 2013 survey, 56% of Americans said that religion played a ""very important role in their lives"", a far higher figure than that of any other wealthy nation.<br/>4. In a 2009 Gallup poll 42% of Americans said that they attended church weekly or almost weekly; the figures ranged from a low of 23% in Vermont to a high of 63% in Mississippi.According to a 2012 survey, 73% of adults identified themselves as Christian, down from 86.4% in 1990.Protestant denominations accounted for 48%, while Roman Catholicism, at 22%, was the largest individual denomination.<br/>5.

Other religions include Judaism (1.7%), Buddhism (0.7%), Islam (0.6%), Hinduism (0.4%), and Unitarian Universalism (0.3%).<br/>7. The survey also reported that 19.6% of Americans described themselves as agnostic, atheist or simply having no religion, up from 8.2% in 1990.<br/>8. There are also Baha'i, Sikh, Jain, Shinto, Confucian, Taoist, Druid, Native American, Wiccan, humanist and deist communities.Protestantism is the largest group of religions in the United States, with Baptists being the largest Protestant sect, and the Southern Baptist Convention being the largest Protestant denomination in the U.S. Roman Catholicism in the U.S. has its origin in the Spanish and French colonization of the Americas, and later grew due to Irish, Italian, Polish, German and Hispanic immigration.<br/>9. Rhode Island is the only state where the majority of the population is Catholic.<br/>10. Lutheranism in the U.S. has its origin in immigration from Northern Europe.<br/>11. North and South Dakota are the only states in which a plurality of the population is Lutheran.<br/>12. Utah is the only state where Mormonism is the religion of the majority of the population.<br/>13. Mormonism is also relatively common in parts of Idaho, Nevada and Wyoming.The Bible Belt is an informal term for a region in the Southern United States in which socially conservative evangelical Protestantism is a significant part of the culture and Christian church attendance across the denominations is generally higher than the nation's average.<br/>14.

Germany was to demobilize sufficient soldiers by 31 March 1920, to leave an army of no more than in a maximum of seven infantry and three cavalry divisions.<br/>4. The treaty laid down the organisation of the divisions and support units, and the General Staff was to be dissolved.<br/>5. Military schools for officer training were limited to three, one school per arm and conscription was to abolished.<br/>6. Private soldiers and Non-commissioned officers were to be retained for at least twelve years and officers for a minimum of with former officers being forbidden to attend military exercises.<br/>7. To prevent Germany from building up a large cadre of trained men, the number of men allowed to leave early was limited.The number of civilian staff supporting the army was reduced and the police force reduced to its pre-war size, with increases limited to population increases; paramilitary forces were forbidden.<br/>8. The Rhineland was to be demilitarized, all fortifications in the Rhineland and east of the river were to be demolished and new construction was forbidden.<br/>9. Military structures and fortifications on the islands of Heligoland and Düne were to be destroyed.<br/>10.

Germany-Politics,"Category: Country<br/>Title: Germany<br/>Section: Politics<br/><br/>1. Germany is a federal, parliamentary, representative democratic republic.<br/>2. The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 constitutional document known as the ""Grundgesetz"" (Basic Law).<br/>3. Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both chambers of parliament; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, and the rule of law are valid in perpetuity.The president is the head of state and invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers.<br/>4. He is elected by the ""Bundesversammlung"" (federal convention), an institution consisting of the members of the ""Bundestag"" and an equal number of state delegates.<br/>5. The second-highest official in the German order of precedence is the ""Bundestagspräsident"" (President of the ""Bundestag""), who is elected by the ""Bundestag"" and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body.The third-highest official and the head of government is the Chancellor, who is appointed by the ""Bundespräsident"" after being elected by the ""Bundestag"".<br/>6. The chancellor, currently Angela Merkel, is the head of government and exercises executive power, similar to the role of a Prime Minister in other parliamentary democracies.Federal legislative power is vested in the parliament consisting of the ""Bundestag"" (Federal Diet) and ""Bundesrat"" (Federal Council), which together form the legislative body.<br/>7. The ""Bundestag"" is elected through direct elections, by proportional representation (mixed-member).<br/>8. The members of the ""Bundesrat"" represent the governments of the sixteen federated states and are members of the state cabinets.Since 1949, the party system has been dominated by the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party of Germany.<br/>9. So far every chancellor has been a member of one of these parties.<br/>10. However, the smaller liberal Free Democratic Party (which had members in the Bundestag from 1949 to 2013) and the Alliance '90/The Greens (which has had seats in parliament since 1983) have also played important roles.Minor parties such as The Left, Free Voters and the Pirate Party are represented in some state parliaments.<br/>"
Disneyland-Opening_day,"Category: Travel<br/>Title: Disneyland<br/>Section: Opening day<br/><br/>1. Disneyland was dedicated at an ""International Press Preview"" event held on Sunday, July 17, 1955, which was only open to invited guests and the media.<br/>2. Although 28,000 people attended the event, only about half of those were actual invitees, the rest having purchased counterfeit tickets.<br/>3. The following day, it opened to the public, featuring twenty attractions.<br/>4. The Special Sunday events, including the dedication, were televised nationwide and anchored by three of Walt Disney's friends from Hollywood: Art Linkletter, Bob Cummings, and Ronald Reagan.<br/>5. ABC broadcast the event live, during which many guests tripped over the television camera cables.<br/>6. In Frontierland, a camera caught Cummings kissing a dancer.<br/>7. When Disney started to read the plaque for Tomorrowland, he read partway then stopped when a technician off-camera said something to him, and after realizing he was on-air, said, ""I thought I got a signal"", and began the dedication from the start.<br/>8. At one point, while in Fantasyland, Linkletter tried to give coverage to Cummings, who was on the pirateship.<br/>9. He was not ready, and tried to give the coverage back to Linkletter, who had lost his microphone.<br/>10. Cummings then did a play-by-play of him trying to find it in front of Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.Traffic was delayed on the two-lane Harbor Boulevard.<br/>11. Famous figures who were scheduled to show up every two hours showed up all at once.<br/>12. The temperature was an unusually high , and because of a local plumbers' strike, Disney was given a choice of having working drinking fountains or running toilets.<br/>13. He chose the latter, leaving many drinking fountains dry.<br/>14. This generated negative publicity since Pepsi sponsored the park's opening; disappointed guests believed the inoperable fountains were a cynical way to sell soda, while other vendors ran out of food.<br/>15. The asphalt that had been poured that morning was soft enough to let ladies' high-heeled shoes sink into it.<br/>16. A gas leak in Fantasyland caused Adventureland, Frontierland, and Fantasyland to close for the afternoon.<br/>17. Some parents threw their children over the crowd's shoulders to get them onto rides, such as the King Arthur Carrousel.<br/>18. In later years, Disney and his 1955 executives referred to July 17, 1955 as ""Black Sunday"".After the extremely negative press from the preview opening, Walt Disney invited attendees back for a private ""second day"" to experience Disneyland properly.<br/>19. The next day, crowds gathered in line as early as 2:00 am.<br/>20. The first person to buy a ticket and enter the park was David MacPherson with ticket number 2, as Roy O. Disney arranged to pre-purchase ticket number 1 from Curtis Lineberry, the manager of admissions.<br/>21. However, an official picture of Walt Disney and two children, Christine Vess Watkins (age 5) and Michael Schwartner (7), inaccurately identifies them as the first two guests of Disneyland.<br/>22. Both received lifetime passes to Disneyland that day, and MacPherson was awarded one shortly thereafter, which was later expanded to every single Disney-owned park in the world.<br/>23.

The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China in part to protect the Chinese Empire or its prototypical states against intrusions by various nomadic groups or military incursions by various warlike peoples or forces.<br/>2. Several walls were being built as early as the 7th century BC; these, later joined together and made bigger and stronger, are now collectively referred to as the Great Wall.<br/>3. Especially famous is the wall built between 220–206 BC by the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang.<br/>4. Little of that wall remains.<br/>5. Since then, the Great Wall has on and off been rebuilt, maintained, and enhanced; the majority of the existing wall are from the Ming Dynasty.Other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and emigration.<br/>6. Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of watch towers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor.The main Great Wall line stretches from Shanhaiguan in the east, to Lop Lake in the west, along an arc that roughly delineates the southern edge of Inner Mongolia.<br/>7. A comprehensive archaeological survey, using advanced technologies, has concluded that the Ming walls measure .<br/>8.

About ""The Cherry Tree"" Vincent wrote to Theo on 21 April 1888 and said he had 10 orchards and: ""one big (painting) of a cherry tree, which I've spoiled"".<br/>5. The following spring he painted another smaller group of orchards, including ""View of Arles, Flowering Orchards"".Van Gogh was taken by the landscape and vegetation of the South of France, and often visited the farm gardens near Arles.<br/>6. Because of the vivid light supplied by the Mediterranean climate his palette significantly brightened.<br/>7. From his arrival, he was interested in capturing the effect of the seasons on the surrounding landscape and plant life.<br/>"
Pablo_Picasso-Style_and_technique,"Category: Art<br/>Title: Pablo Picasso<br/>Section: Style and technique<br/><br/>1. Picasso was exceptionally prolific throughout his long lifetime.<br/>2. The total number of artworks he produced has been estimated at 50,000, comprising 1,885 paintings; 1,228 sculptures; 2,880 ceramics, roughly 12,000 drawings, many thousands of prints, and numerous tapestries and rugs.<br/>3. The medium in which Picasso made his most important contribution was painting.<br/>4. In his paintings, Picasso used color as an expressive element, but relied on drawing rather than subtleties of color to create form and space.<br/>5. He sometimes added sand to his paint to vary its texture.<br/>6. A nanoprobe of Picasso's ""The Red Armchair"" (1931) by physicists at Argonne National Laboratory in 2012 confirmed art historians' belief that Picasso used common house paint in many of his paintings.<br/>7. Much of his painting was done at night by artificial light.<br/>8. Picasso's early sculptures were carved from wood or modeled in wax or clay, but from 1909 to 1928 Picasso abandoned modeling and instead made sculptural constructions using diverse materials.<br/>9. An example is ""Guitar"" (1912), a relief construction made of sheet metal and wire that Jane Fluegel terms a ""three-dimensional planar counterpart of Cubist painting"" that marks a ""revolutionary departure from the traditional approaches, modeling and carving"".From the beginning of his career, Picasso displayed an interest in subject matter of every kind, and demonstrated a great stylistic versatility that enabled him to work in several styles at once.<br/>10. For example, his paintings of 1917 included the pointillist ""Woman with a Mantilla"", the Cubist ""Figure in an Armchair"", and the naturalistic ""Harlequin"" (all in the Museu Picasso, Barcelona).<br/>11. In 1919, he made a number of drawings from postcards and photographs that reflect his interest in the stylistic conventions and static character of posed photographs.<br/>12. In 1921 he simultaneously painted several large neoclassical paintings and two versions of the Cubist composition ""Three Musicians"" (Museum of Modern Art, New York; Philadelphia Museum of Art).<br/>13. In an interview published in 1923, Picasso said, ""The several manners I have used in my art must not be considered as an evolution, or as steps towards an unknown ideal of painting … If the subjects I have wanted to express have suggested different ways of expression I have never hesitated to adopt them.<br/>14. ""Although his Cubist works approach abstraction, Picasso never relinquished the objects of the real world as subject matter.<br/>15. Prominent in his Cubist paintings are forms easily recognized as guitars, violins, and bottles.<br/>16. When Picasso depicted complex narrative scenes it was usually in prints, drawings, and small-scale works; ""Guernica"" (1937) is one of his few large narrative paintings.Picasso painted mostly from imagination or memory.<br/>17. According to William Rubin, Picasso ""could only make great art from subjects that truly involved him ….<br/>18. Unlike Matisse, Picasso had eschewed models virtually all his mature life, preferring to paint individuals whose lives had both impinged on, and had real significance for, his own.""<br/>19. The art critic Arthur Danto said Picasso's work constitutes a ""vast pictorial autobiography"" that provides some basis for the popular conception that ""Picasso invented a new style each time he fell in love with a new woman"".<br/>20. The autobiographical nature of Picasso's art is reinforced by his habit of dating his works, often to the day.<br/>21. He explained: ""I want to leave to posterity a documentation that will be as complete as possible.<br/>22. That's why I put a date on everything I do.""<br/>"
Colosseum-Arena_and_hypogeum,"Category: Travel<br/>Title: Colosseum<br/>Section: Arena and hypogeum<br/><br/>1. The arena itself was 83 meters by 48 meters (272 ft by 157 ft / 280 by 163 Roman feet).<br/>2. It comprised a wooden floor covered by sand (the Latin word for sand is ""harena"" or ""arena""), covering an elaborate underground structure called the ""hypogeum"" (literally meaning ""underground"").<br/>3. Little now remains of the original arena floor, but the ""hypogeum"" is still clearly visible.<br/>4. It consisted of a two-level subterranean network of tunnels and cages beneath the arena where gladiators and animals were held before contests began.<br/>5. Eighty vertical shafts provided instant access to the arena for caged animals and scenery pieces concealed underneath; larger hinged platforms, called ""hegmata"", provided access for elephants and the like.<br/>6. It was restructured on numerous occasions; at least twelve different phases of construction can be seen.The ""hypogeum"" was connected by underground tunnels to a number of points outside the Colosseum.<br/>7. Animals and performers were brought through the tunnel from nearby stables, with the gladiators' barracks at the Ludus Magnus to the east also being connected by tunnels.<br/>8. Separate tunnels were provided for the Emperor and the Vestal Virgins to permit them to enter and exit the Colosseum without needing to pass through the crowds.Substantial quantities of machinery also existed in the ""hypogeum"".<br/>9. Elevators and pulleys raised and lowered scenery and props, as well as lifting caged animals to the surface for release.<br/>10. There is evidence for the existence of major hydraulic mechanisms and according to ancient accounts, it was possible to flood the arena rapidly, presumably via a connection to a nearby aqueduct.<br/>"

Global_warming-Political_discussion,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Global warming<br/>Section: Political discussion<br/><br/>1. Discourse about global warming.Political discussion.Most countries are Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).The ultimate objective of the Convention is to prevent dangerous human interference of the climate system.As is stated in the Convention, this requires that GHG concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change, food production is not threatened, and economic development can proceed in a sustainable fashion.<br/>2. The Framework Convention was agreed in 1992, but since then, global emissions have risen.<br/>3. During negotiations, the G77 (a lobbying group in the United Nations representing 133 developing nations) pushed for a mandate requiring developed countries to "" the lead"" in reducing their emissions.<br/>4. This was justified on the basis that: the developed world's emissions had contributed most to the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere; per-capita emissions (i.e., emissions per head of population) were still relatively low in developing countries; and the emissions of developing countries would grow to meet their development needs.<br/>5. This mandate was sustained in the Kyoto Protocol to the Framework Convention, which entered into legal effect in 2005.In ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, most developed countries accepted legally binding commitments to limit their emissions.<br/>6. These first-round commitments expired in 2012.US President George W. Bush rejected the treaty on the basis that ""it exempts 80% of the world, including major population centers such as China and India, from compliance, and would cause serious harm to the US economy.<br/>7. ""At the 15th UNFCCC Conference of the Parties, held in 2009 at Copenhagen, several UNFCCC Parties produced the Copenhagen Accord.Parties associated with the Accord (140 countries, as of November 2010)aim to limit the future increase in global mean temperature to below .<br/>8. A preliminary assessment published in November 2010 by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) suggests a possible ""emissions gap"" between the voluntary pledges made in the Accord and the emissions cuts necessary to have a ""likely"" (greater than 66% probability) chance of meeting the objective.The UNEP assessment takes the objective as being measured against the pre-industrial global mean temperature level.<br/>9. To having a likely chance of meeting the objective, assessed studies generally indicated the need for global emissions to peak before 2020, with substantial declines in emissions thereafter.The 16th Conference of the Parties (COP16) was held at Cancún in 2010.<br/>10. It produced an agreement, not a binding treaty, that the Parties should take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to meet a goal of limiting global warming to above pre-industrial temperatures.<br/>11.

Boston_Tea_Party-Abstract,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Boston Tea Party<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. The Boston Tea Party (initially referred to by John Adams as ""the Destruction of the Tea in Boston"") was a political protest by the Sons of Liberty in Boston, on December 16, 1773.<br/>2. Disguised as American Indians, the demonstrators destroyed an entire shipment of tea, which had been sent by the East India Company, in defiance of the Tea Act of May 10, 1773.<br/>3. They boarded the ships and threw the chests of tea into Boston Harbor, ruining the tea.<br/>4. The British government responded harshly and the episode escalated into the American Revolution.<br/>5. The Tea Party became an iconic event of American history, and other political protests such as the Tea Party movement after 2010 explicitly refer to it.The Tea Party was the culmination of a resistance movement throughout British America against the Tea Act, which had been passed by the British Parliament in 1773.<br/>6. Colonists objected to the Tea Act because they believed that it violated their rights as Englishmen to ""No taxation without representation,"" that is, be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a British parliament in which they were not represented.<br/>7. Protesters had successfully prevented the unloading of taxed tea in three other colonies, but in Boston, embattled Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.The Boston Tea Party was a key event in the growth of the American Revolution.<br/>8. Parliament responded in 1774 with the Coercive Acts, or Intolerable Acts, which, among other provisions, ended local self-government in Massachusetts and closed Boston's commerce.<br/>9. Colonists up and down the Thirteen Colonies in turn responded to the Coercive Acts with additional acts of protest, and by convening the First Continental Congress, which petitioned the British monarch for repeal of the acts and coordinated colonial resistance to them.<br/>10. The crisis escalated, and the American Revolutionary War began near Boston in 1775.<br/>"
Ice_cream-Production,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Ice cream<br/>Section: Production<br/><br/>1. Before the development of modern refrigeration, ice cream was a luxury reserved for special occasions.<br/>2. Making it was quite laborious; ice was cut from lakes and ponds during the winter and stored in holes in the ground, or in wood-frame or brick ice houses, insulated by straw.<br/>3. Many farmers and plantation owners, including U.S. Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, cut and stored ice in the winter for use in the summer.<br/>4. Frederic Tudor of Boston turned ice harvesting and shipping into a big business, cutting ice in New England and shipping it around the world.Ice cream was made by hand in a large bowl placed inside a tub filled with ice and salt.<br/>5. This was called the pot-freezer method.<br/>6. French confectioners refined the pot-freezer method, making ice cream in a sorbetière (a covered pail with a handle attached to the lid).<br/>7. In the pot-freezer method, the temperature of the ingredients is reduced by the mixture of crushed ice and salt.<br/>8. The salt water is cooled by the ice, and the action of the salt on the ice causes it to (partially) melt, absorbing latent heat and bringing the mixture below the freezing point of pure water.<br/>9. The immersed container can also make better thermal contact with the salty water and ice mixture than it could with ice alone.The hand-cranked churn, which also uses ice and salt for cooling, replaced the pot-freezer method.<br/>10. The exact origin of the hand-cranked freezer is unknown, but the first U.S. patent for one was #3254 issued to Nancy Johnson on September 9, 1843.<br/>11. The hand-cranked churn produced smoother ice cream than the pot freezer and did it quicker.<br/>12. Many inventors patented improvements on Johnson's design.In Europe and early America, ice cream was made and sold by small businesses, mostly confectioners and caterers.<br/>13. Jacob Fussell of Baltimore, Maryland was the first to manufacture ice cream on a large scale.<br/>14. Fussell bought fresh dairy products from farmers in York County, Pennsylvania, and sold them in Baltimore.<br/>15. An unstable demand for his dairy products often left him with a surplus of cream, which he made into ice cream.<br/>16. He built his first ice cream factory in Seven Valleys, Pennsylvania, in 1851.<br/>17. Two years later, he moved his factory to Baltimore.<br/>18. Later, he opened factories in several other cities and taught the business to others, who operated their own plants.<br/>19. Mass production reduced the cost of ice cream and added to its popularity.The development of industrial refrigeration by German engineer Carl von Linde during the 1870s eliminated the need to cut and store natural ice, and, when the continuous-process freezer was perfected in 1926, commercial mass production of ice cream and the birth of the modern ice cream industry was underway.The most common method for producing ice cream at home is to use an ice cream maker, in modern times, in general, an electrical device that churns the ice cream mixture while cooled inside a household freezer, or using a solution of pre-frozen salt and water, which gradually melts while the ice cream freezes.<br/>20. Some more expensive models have an inbuilt freezing element.<br/>21. A newer method of making home-made ice cream is to add liquid nitrogen to the mixture while stirring it using a spoon or spatula for a few seconds; a similar technique, advocated by Heston Blumenthal as ideal for home cooks, is to add dry ice to the mixture while stirring for a few minutes.<br/>22. Some ice cream recipes call for making a custard, folding in whipped cream, and immediately freezing the mixture.<br/>"
Sausage-Chile,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Sausage<br/>Section: Chile<br/><br/>1. <br/>2. ""Longaniza"" is the most common type of sausage, or at least the most common name in Chile for sausages that also could be classified as chorizo.<br/>3. The Chilean variety is made of four parts pork to one part bacon (or less) and seasoned with finely ground garlic, salt, pepper, cumin, oregano, paprika and chilli sauce.<br/>4. The cities of Chillán and San Carlos are known among Chileans for having the best ""longanizas"".Another traditional sausage is the ""prieta"", the Chilean version of blood sausage, generally known elsewhere in Latin America as ""morcilla"".<br/>5. In Chile, it contains onions, spices and sometimes walnut or rice and is usually eaten at ""asados"" or accompanied by simple boiled potatoes.<br/>6. It sometimes has a very thick skin so is cut open lengthwise before eating.<br/>7. ""Vienesa""s or Vienna sausages are also very common and are mainly used in the ""completo"", the Chilean version of the hot dog.<br/>"
Japan-Environment,"Category: Country<br/>Title: Japan<br/>Section: Environment<br/><br/>1. In the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s.<br/>2. Responding to rising concern about the problem, the government introduced several environmental protection laws in 1970.<br/>3. The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources.<br/>4. Current environmental issues include urban air pollution (NOx, suspended particulate matter, and toxics), waste management, water eutrophication, nature conservation, climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.Japan is one of the world's leaders in the development of new environment-friendly technologies, and is ranked 26th best in the world in the 2014 Environmental Performance Index.<br/>5. As a signatory of the Kyoto Protocol, and host of the 1997 conference which created it, Japan is under treaty obligation to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps to curb climate change.<br/>"
Manhattan_Project-Ore,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Manhattan Project<br/>Section: Ore<br/><br/>1. Uranium.Ore.The key raw material for the project was uranium, which was used as fuel for the reactors, as feed that was transformed into plutonium, and, in its enriched form, in the atomic bomb itself.<br/>2. There were four known major deposits of uranium in 1940: in Colorado, in northern Canada, in Joachimstal in Czechoslovakia, and in the Belgian Congo.<br/>3. All but Joachimstal were in allied hands.<br/>4. A November 1942 survey determined that sufficient quantities of uranium were available to satisfy the project's requirements.<br/>5. Nichols arranged with the State Department for export controls to be placed on uranium oxide and negotiated for the purchase of of uranium ore from the Belgian Congo that was being stored in a warehouse on Staten Island and the remaining stocks of mined ore stored in the Congo.<br/>6. He negotiated with Eldorado Gold Mines for the purchase of ore from its mine in Port Hope, Ontario, and its shipment in 100-ton lots.<br/>7. The Canadian government subsequently bought up the company's stock until it acquired a controlling interest.While these purchases assured a sufficient supply to meet wartime needs, the American and British leaders concluded that it was in their countries' interest to gain control of as much of the world's uranium deposits as possible.<br/>8. The richest source of ore was the Shinkolobwe mine in the Belgian Congo, but it was flooded and closed.<br/>9. Nichols unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate its reopening and the sale of the entire future output to the United States with Edgar Sengier, the director of the company that owned the mine, Union Minière du Haut Katanga.<br/>10. The matter was then taken up by the Combined Policy Committee.<br/>11. As 30 percent of Union Minière's stock was controlled by British interests, the British took the lead in negotiations.<br/>12. Sir John Anderson and Ambassador John Winant hammered out a deal with Sengier and the Belgian government in May 1944 for the mine to be reopened and of ore to be purchased at $1.45 a pound.<br/>13. To avoid dependence on the British and Canadians for ore, Groves also arranged for the purchase of US Vanadium Corporation's stockpile in Uravan, Colorado.<br/>14. Uranium mining in Colorado yielded about of ore.Mallinckrodt Incorporated in St. Louis, Missouri, took the raw ore and dissolved it in nitric acid to produce uranyl nitrate.<br/>15. Ether was then added in a liquid–liquid extraction process to separate the impurities from the uranyl nitrate.<br/>16. This was then heated to form uranium trioxide, which was reduced to highly pure uranium dioxide.<br/>17. By July 1942, Mallinckrodt was producing a ton of highly pure oxide a day, but turning this into uranium metal initially proved more difficult for contractors Westinghouse and Metal Hydrides.<br/>18. Production was too slow and quality was unacceptably low.<br/>19. A special branch of the Metallurgical Laboratory was established at Iowa State College in Ames, Iowa, under Frank Spedding to investigate alternatives, and its Ames process became available in 1943.<br/>"
Astrology-Effectiveness,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Astrology<br/>Section: Effectiveness<br/><br/>1. Astrology has not demonstrated its effectiveness in controlled studies and has no scientific validity, and as such, is regarded as pseudoscience.<br/>2. Where astrology has made falsifiable predictions, it has been falsified.<br/>3. Shawn Carlson's double-blind chart matching test, in which twenty eight astrologers agreed to match over 100 natal charts to psychological profiles generated by the California Psychological Inventory (CPI) test, is one of the most renowned tests of astrology.<br/>4. The experimental protocol used in Carlson's study was agreed to by a group of physicists and astrologers prior to the experiment.<br/>5. Astrologers, nominated by the National Council for Geocosmic Research, acted as the astrological advisors, and helped to ensure, and agreed, that the test was fair.<br/>6. They also chose twentysix of the twentyeight astrologers for the tests, the other two being interested astrologers who volunteered afterwards.<br/>7. The astrologers, from Europe and the United States, helped to draw up the central proposition of natal astrology to be tested.<br/>8. Published in ""Nature"" in 1985, the study found that predictions based on natal astrology were no better than chance, and that the testing ""clearly refutes the astrological hypothesis"".In 1955, astrologer and psychologist Michel Gauquelin stated that although he had failed to find evidence to support such indicators as the zodiacal signs and planetary aspects in astrology, he had found positive correlations between the diurnal positions of some of the planets and success in some professions which astrology traditionally associates with those planets.<br/>9. The best-known of Gauquelin's findings is based on the positions of Mars in the natal charts of successful athletes and became known as the ""Mars effect"".<br/>10. A study conducted by seven French scientists attempted to replicate the claim, but found no statistical evidence.<br/>11. They attributed the effect to selective bias on Gauquelin's part, accusing him of attempting to persuade them to add or delete names from their study.Geoffrey Dean has suggested that the effect may be caused by self-reporting of birth dates by parents rather than any issue with the study by Gauquelin.<br/>12. The suggestion is that a small subset of the parents may have had changed birth times to be consistent with better astrological charts for a related profession.<br/>13. The sample group was taken from a time where belief in astrology was more common.<br/>14. Gauquelin had failed to find the Mars effect in more recent populations, where a nurse or doctor recorded the birth information.<br/>15. The number of births under astrologically undesirable conditions was also lower, indicating more evidence that parents choose dates and times to suit their beliefs.Dean, a scientist and former astrologer, and psychologist Ivan Kelly conducted a large scale scientific test, involving more than one hundred cognitive, behavioural, physical and other variables, but found no support for astrology.<br/>16. Furthermore, a meta-analysis was conducted pooling 40 studies consisting of 700 astrologers and over 1,000 birth charts.<br/>17. Ten of the tests, which had a total of 300 participating, involved the astrologers picking the correct chart interpretation out of a number of others which were not the astrologically correct chart interpretation (usually 3 to 5 others).<br/>18. When the date and other obvious clues were removed no significant results were found to suggest there was any preferred chart.<br/>"

Mike Strange recorded and mixed Eminem's vocals at Effigy Studios in Ferndale, Michigan.<br/>2. The sessions took two days.<br/>3. Strange edited the vocals with D-Verb—a reverberation software—and an Extra Long Delay plug-in.<br/>4. He preferred to make few changes; for ""Love the Way You Lie"" he almost exclusively used board compression and console equalization.<br/>5. Strange used the Bricasti and Eventide Reverb 2016 mixing tools for ""brighter"" reverberation.<br/>6. Detroit musician Luis Resto has contributed to the arrangement on many of Eminem's songs, but did not do so for ""Love the Way You Lie"".<br/>7. According to Strange, ""Everything we needed was already in the track, apart from the vocals.""<br/>8. Two to three weeks after the sessions, Alex da Kid arrived to help mix and master the track.<br/>9. He wanted to replace the acoustic guitar on the demo, but Eminem chose to keep it.<br/>10. Strange said, ""It was simply a matter of trying to match and then to improve on the demo da Kid'd sent us.""<br/>11. Strange's brother Joe engineered the track.Rihanna's recording sessions took place at Sun Studios in Dublin, Ireland.<br/>12. Marcos Tovar mixed her vocals, which were engineered by Spike Lindsey and mastered from Detroit over the Internet.<br/>13. The American songwriter Makeba Riddick provided additional vocal production.<br/>14. Strange used equalization, compression and reverberation but left the vocal balance.<br/>15.

Physics-Difference_between_classical_and_modern_physics,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Physics<br/>Section: Difference between classical and modern physics<br/><br/>1. While physics aims to discover universal laws, its theories lie in explicit domains of applicability.<br/>2. Loosely speaking, the laws of classical physics accurately describe systems whose important length scales are greater than the atomic scale and whose motions are much slower than the speed of light.<br/>3. Outside of this domain, observations do not match their predictions.<br/>4. Albert Einstein contributed the framework of special relativity, which replaced notions of absolute time and space with spacetime and allowed an accurate description of systems whose components have speeds approaching the speed of light.<br/>5. Max Planck, Erwin Schrödinger, and others introduced quantum mechanics, a probabilistic notion of particles and interactions that allowed an accurate description of atomic and subatomic scales.<br/>6. Later, quantum field theory unified quantum mechanics and special relativity.<br/>7. General relativity allowed for a dynamical, curved spacetime, with which highly massive systems and the large-scale structure of the universe can be well-described.<br/>8. General relativity has not yet been unified with the other fundamental descriptions; several candidate theories of quantum gravity are being developed.<br/>"
Breaking_Bad-Casting,"Category: Tv<br/>Title: Breaking Bad<br/>Section: Casting<br/><br/>1. <br/>2. ""Breaking Bad"" creator Vince Gilligan cast Bryan Cranston for the role of Walter White based on having worked with him in an episode of the science fiction television series ""The X-Files"", on which Gilligan worked as a writer.<br/>3. Cranston played an anti-Semite with a terminal illness who took series co-protagonist Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) hostage.<br/>4. Gilligan said the character had to be simultaneously loathsome and sympathetic, and that ""Bryan alone was the only actor who could do that, who could pull off that trick.<br/>5. And it is a trick.<br/>6. I have no idea how he does it.""<br/>7. AMC officials, who were initially reluctant with the casting choice, having known Cranston only as the over-the-top character Hal on the comedy series ""Malcolm in the Middle"", approached actors John Cusack and Matthew Broderick about the role.<br/>8. When both actors declined, the executives were persuaded to cast Cranston after seeing his ""X-Files"" episode.Cranston contributed a great deal to the Walter White persona.<br/>9. When Gilligan left much of Walter's past unexplained during the development of the series, the actor wrote his own backstory for the character.<br/>10. At the start of the show, Cranston gained 10 pounds to reflect the character's personal decline and had the natural red highlights of his hair dyed a regular brown.<br/>11. He collaborated with costume designer Kathleen Detoro on a wardrobe of mostly neutral green and brown colors to make the character bland and unremarkable, and worked with makeup artist Frieda Valenzuela to create a mustache he described as ""impotent"" and like a ""dead caterpillar"".<br/>12. Cranston repeatedly identified elements within certain scripts where he disagreed with how the character was handled, and went so far as to call Gilligan directly when he could not work out disagreements with the episode's screenwriters.<br/>13. Cranston has said he was inspired partially by his elderly father for how Walter carries himself physically, which he described as ""a little hunched over, never erect, if the weight of the world is on this man's shoulders"".<br/>14. In contrast to his character, Cranston has been described as extremely playful on set, with Aaron Paul describing him as ""a kid trapped in a man's body"".Gilligan originally intended for Aaron Paul's character, Jesse Pinkman, to be killed at the end of ""Breaking Bad"" 's first season in a botched drug deal as a plot device to plague Walter White with guilt.<br/>15. However, Gilligan said by the second episode of the season, he was so impressed with Paul's performance that ""it became pretty clear early on that would be a huge, colossal mistake, to kill off Jesse"".<br/>"

The eukaryotic cells emerged between 1.6 – 2.7 billion years ago.<br/>4. The next major change in cell structure came when bacteria were engulfed by eukaryotic cells, in a cooperative association called endosymbiosis.<br/>5. The engulfed bacteria and the host cell then underwent co-evolution, with the bacteria evolving into either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes.<br/>6. Another engulfment of cyanobacterial-like organisms led to the formation of chloroplasts in algae and plants.<br/>7. *</ref>The history of life was that of the unicellular eukaryotes, prokaryotes and archaea until about 610 million years ago when multicellular organisms began to appear in the oceans in the Ediacaran period.<br/>8. The evolution of multicellularity occurred in multiple independent events, in organisms as diverse as sponges, brown algae, cyanobacteria, slime moulds and myxobacteria.Soon after the emergence of these first multicellular organisms, a remarkable amount of biological diversity appeared over approximately 10 million years, in an event called the Cambrian explosion.<br/>9. Here, the majority of types of modern animals appeared in the fossil record, as well as unique lineages that subsequently became extinct.<br/>10. Various triggers for the Cambrian explosion have been proposed, including the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere from photosynthesis.<br/>11. *</ref>About 500 million years ago, plants and fungi colonised the land and were soon followed by arthropods and other animals.<br/>12. Insects were particularly successful and even today make up the majority of animal species.<br/>13. Amphibians first appeared around 364 million years ago, followed by early amniotes and birds around 155 million years ago (both from ""reptile""-like lineages), mammals around 129 million years ago, homininae around 10 million years ago and modern humans around 250,000 years ago.<br/>14. However, despite the evolution of these large animals, smaller organisms similar to the types that evolved early in this process continue to be highly successful and dominate the Earth, with the majority of both biomass and species being prokaryotes.<br/>"

DNA-Sense_and_antisense,"Category: Science<br/>Title: DNA<br/>Section: Sense and antisense<br/><br/>1. A DNA sequence is called ""sense"" if its sequence is the same as that of a messenger RNA copy that is translated into protein.<br/>2. The sequence on the opposite strand is called the ""antisense"" sequence.<br/>3. Both sense and antisense sequences can exist on different parts of the same strand of DNA (i.e.<br/>4. both strands can contain both sense and antisense sequences).<br/>5. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, antisense RNA sequences are produced, but the functions of these RNAs are not entirely clear.<br/>6. One proposal is that antisense RNAs are involved in regulating gene expression through RNA-RNA base pairing.A few DNA sequences in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and more in plasmids and viruses, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping genes.<br/>7. In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read in the opposite direction along the other strand.<br/>8. In bacteria, this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription, while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.<br/>"
The_Matrix-Sound_effects_and_music,"Category: Movies<br/>Title: The Matrix<br/>Section: Sound effects and music<br/><br/>1. Dane A. Davis was responsible for creating the sound effects for the film.<br/>2. The fight scenes sound effects, such as the whipping sounds of punches, came from using junk to create noises and capturing them, then editing the sounds.<br/>3. The sound of the pod containing a human baby closing required almost fifty sounds put together.The film's score was composed by Don Davis.<br/>4. He noted that mirrors appear frequently in the film: reflections of the blue and red pills are seen in Morpheus's glasses; Neo's capture by Agents is viewed through the rear-view mirror of Trinity's Triumph Speed Triple motorcycle; Neo observes a broken mirror mending itself; reflections warp as a spoon is bent; the reflection of a helicopter is visible as it approaches a skyscraper.<br/>5. Davis focused on this theme of reflections when creating his score, alternating between sections of the orchestra and attempting to incorporate contrapuntal ideas.<br/>6. Davis' score combines orchestral, choral and synthesizer elements; the balance between these elements varies depending on whether humans or machines are the dominant subject of a given scene.In addition to Davis' score, ""The Matrix"" soundtrack also features music from acts such as Rammstein, Rob Dougan, Rage Against the Machine, Propellerheads, Ministry, Deftones, Monster Magnet, The Prodigy, Rob Zombie, Meat Beat Manifesto, and Marilyn Manson.<br/>"
RNA-In_translation,"Category: Science<br/>Title: RNA<br/>Section: In translation<br/><br/>1. Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries information about a protein sequence to the ribosomes, the protein synthesis factories in the cell.<br/>2. It is coded so that every three nucleotides (a codon) correspond to one amino acid.<br/>3. In eukaryotic cells, once precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) has been transcribed from DNA, it is processed to mature mRNA.<br/>4. This removes its introns—non-coding sections of the pre-mRNA.<br/>5. The mRNA is then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is bound to ribosomes and translated into its corresponding protein form with the help of tRNA.<br/>6. In prokaryotic cells, which do not have nucleus and cytoplasm compartments, mRNA can bind to ribosomes while it is being transcribed from DNA.<br/>7. After a certain amount of time the message degrades into its component nucleotides with the assistance of ribonucleases.Transfer RNA (tRNA) is a small RNA chain of about 80 nucleotides that transfers a specific amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during translation.<br/>8. It has sites for amino acid attachment and an anticodon region for codon recognition that binds to a specific sequence on the messenger RNA chain through hydrogen bonding.Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is the catalytic component of the ribosomes.<br/>9. Eukaryotic ribosomes contain four different rRNA molecules: 18S, 5.8S, 28S and 5S rRNA.<br/>10. Three of the rRNA molecules are synthesized in the nucleolus, and one is synthesized elsewhere.<br/>11. In the cytoplasm, ribosomal RNA and protein combine to form a nucleoprotein called a ribosome.<br/>12. The ribosome binds mRNA and carries out protein synthesis.<br/>13. Several ribosomes may be attached to a single mRNA at any time.<br/>14. Nearly all the RNA found in a typical eukaryotic cell is rRNA.Transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) is found in many bacteria and plastids.<br/>15. It tags proteins encoded by mRNAs that lack stop codons for degradation and prevents the ribosome from stalling.<br/>"
Biology-Homeostasis,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Biology<br/>Section: Homeostasis<br/><br/>1. Homeostasis is the ability of an open system to regulate its internal environment to maintain stable conditions by means of multiple dynamic equilibrium adjustments controlled by interrelated regulation mechanisms.<br/>2. All living organisms, whether unicellular or multicellular, exhibit homeostasis.To maintain dynamic equilibrium and effectively carry out certain functions, a system must detect and respond to perturbations.<br/>3. After the detection of a perturbation, a biological system normally responds through negative feedback.<br/>4. This means stabilizing conditions by either reducing or increasing the activity of an organ or system.<br/>5. One example is the release of glucagon when sugar levels are too low.<br/>"

Toy_Story-Abstract,"Category: Movies<br/>Title: Toy Story<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. Toy Story is a 1995 American computer-animated buddy-comedy adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and directed by John Lasseter, released by Walt Disney Pictures, ""Toy Story"" was the first feature-length computer-animated film and the first film produced by Pixar.<br/>2. ""Toy Story"" follows a group of anthropomorphic toys who pretend to be lifeless whenever humans are present, and focuses on the relationship between Woody, a pullstring cowboy doll (Tom Hanks), and Buzz Lightyear, an astronaut action figure (Tim Allen).<br/>3. The film was written by John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen, Alec Sokolow, and Joss Whedon, and featured music by Randy Newman.<br/>4. Its executive producers were Steve Jobs and Edwin Catmull.Pixar, which produced short animated films to promote their computers, was approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature after the success of the short ""Tin Toy"" (1988), which is told from a small toy's perspective.<br/>5. Lasseter, Stanton, and Pete Docter wrote early story treatments which were thrown out by Disney, who pushed for a more edgy film.<br/>6. After disastrous story reels, production was halted and the script was re-written, better reflecting the tone and theme Pixar desired: that ""toys deeply want children to play with them, and that this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions.""<br/>7. The studio, then consisting of a relatively small number of employees, produced the film under minor financial constraints.The top-grossing film on its opening weekend, ""Toy Story"" went on to earn over $361 million worldwide.<br/>8. Reviews were entirely positive, praising both the animation's technical innovation and the screenplay's wit and sophistication, and it is now widely considered by many critics to be one of the best animated films ever made.<br/>9. In addition to home media releases and theatrical re-releases, ""Toy Story""-inspired material has run the gamut from toys, video games, theme park attractions, spin-offs, merchandise, and two sequels—""Toy Story 2"" (1999) and ""Toy Story 3"" (2010)—both of which received massive commercial success and critical acclaim.<br/>10. ""Toy Story"" was inducted into the National Film Registry as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" in 2005, its first year of eligibility.<br/>"
American_Revolution-Patriots,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: American Revolution<br/>Section: Patriots<br/><br/>1. At the time, revolutionaries were called ""Patriots"", ""Whigs"", ""Congress-men"", or ""Americans"".<br/>2. They included a full range of social and economic classes, but were unanimous regarding the need to defend the rights of Americans and uphold the principles of republicanism in terms of rejecting monarchy and aristocracy, while emphasizing civic virtue on the part of the citizens.<br/>3. Newspapers were strongholds of patriotism (although there were a few Loyalist papers), and printed many pamphlets, announcements, patriotic letters and pronouncements.Mark Lender explores why ordinary folk became insurgents against the British even though they were unfamiliar with the ideological rationales being offered.<br/>4. They held very strongly a sense of ""rights"" that they felt the British were violating – rights that stressed local autonomy, fair dealing, and government by consent.<br/>5. They were highly sensitive to the issue of tyranny, which they saw manifested in the British response to the Boston Tea Party.<br/>6. The arrival in Boston of the British Army heightened their sense of violated rights, leading to rage and demands for revenge.<br/>7. They had faith that God was on their side.<br/>"
Apollo_11-Landing,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Apollo 11<br/>Section: Landing<br/><br/>1. When Armstrong again looked outside, he saw that the computer's landing target was in a boulder-strewn area just north and east of a diameter crater (later determined to be ""West crater,"" named for its location in the western part of the originally planned landing ellipse).<br/>2. Armstrong took semi-automatic control and, with Aldrin calling out altitude and velocity data, landed at 20:17:40 UTC on July 20 with about 25 seconds of fuel left.Apollo 11 landed with less fuel than other missions, and the astronauts encountered a premature low fuel warning.<br/>3. This was later found to be the result of greater propellant 'slosh' than expected, uncovering a fuel sensor.<br/>4. On subsequent missions, extra anti-slosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this.Throughout the descent Aldrin had called out navigation data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting the LM.<br/>5. A few moments before the landing, a light informed Aldrin that at least one of the probes hanging from ""Eagle""'s footpads had touched the surface, and he said ""Contact light!""<br/>6. Three seconds later, ""Eagle"" landed and Armstrong said ""Shutdown.""<br/>7. Aldrin immediately said ""Okay, engine stop.<br/>8. ACA - out of detent.""<br/>9. Armstrong acknowledged ""Out of detent.<br/>10. Auto"" and Aldrin continued ""Mode control - both auto.<br/>11. Descent engine command override off.<br/>12. Engine arm - off.<br/>13. 413 is in.<br/>14. ""Charles Duke, acting as CAPCOM during the landing phase, acknowledged their landing by saying ""We copy you down, Eagle.<br/>15. ""Armstrong acknowledged Aldrin's completion of the post landing checklist with ""Engine arm is off,"" before responding to Duke with the words, ""Houston, Tranquility Base here.<br/>16. The ""Eagle"" has landed.""<br/>17. Armstrong's unrehearsed change of call sign from ""Eagle"" to ""Tranquility Base"" emphasized to listeners that landing was complete and successful.<br/>18. Duke mispronounced his reply as he expressed the relief at Mission Control: ""Roger, Twan-- Tranquility, we copy you on the ground.<br/>19. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue.<br/>20. We're breathing again.<br/>21. Thanks a lot.<br/>22. ""Two and a half hours after landing, before preparations began for the EVA, Aldrin broadcast that:The schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five-hour sleep period, since they had been awake since early morning.<br/>23. However, they elected to forgo the sleep period and begin the preparations for the EVA early, thinking that they would be unable to sleep.<br/>"
Yogurt-Strained_yogurt,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Yogurt<br/>Section: Strained yogurt<br/><br/>1. Strained yogurt is yogurt which has been strained through a paper or cloth filter, traditionally made of muslin., to remove the whey, giving a much thicker consistency and a distinctive, slightly tangy taste.<br/>2. Strained yogurt is becoming more popular with those who make yogurt at home, especially if using skim milk which results in a thinner consistency.<br/>3. Once yogurt is made and refrigerated overnight, it is poured in a muslin or cheesecloth bag and hung in the coolest place in the house, with a tub placed underneath to collect the dripping whey.<br/>4. In cold weather a single day (or night) of straining is sufficient.<br/>5. In higher ambient temperatures yogurt will spoil rapidly, therefore it had best be actively squeezed or strained until about a third or more of its initial weight has run off.<br/>6. The remainder is now strained and is refrigerated again.Labneh is a strained yogurt used for sandwiches popular in Arab countries.<br/>7. Olive oil, cucumber slices, olives, and various green herbs may be added.<br/>8. It can be thickened further and rolled into balls, preserved in olive oil, and fermented for a few more weeks.<br/>9. It is sometimes used with onions, meat, and nuts as a stuffing for a variety of pies or kebbeh (كبة) balls.Some types of strained yogurts are boiled in open vats first, so that the liquid content is reduced.<br/>10. The popular East Indian dessert, a variation of traditional dahi called mishti dahi, offers a thicker, more custard-like consistency, and is usually sweeter than western yogurts.Strained yogurt is also enjoyed in Greece and is the main component of ""tzatziki"" (from Turkish ""cacık""), a well-known accompaniment to gyros and souvlaki pita sandwiches: it is a yogurt sauce or dip made with the addition of grated cucumber, olive oil, salt and, optionally, mashed garlic.Srikhand, a popular dessert in India, is made from strained yogurt, saffron, cardamom, nutmeg and sugar and sometimes fruits such as mango or pineapple.In North America and Britain, strained yogurt is commonly called ""Greek yogurt"".<br/>"
Judo-Rank_and_grading,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Judo<br/>Section: Rank and grading<br/><br/>1. Judo is a hierarchical art, where seniority of judoka is designated by what is known as the - ranking system.<br/>2. This system was developed by Jigoro Kano based on the ranking system in the board game Go.<br/>3. Beginning students progress through kyu grades towards dan grades.A judoka's position within the kyu-dan ranking system is displayed by the color of their belt.<br/>4. Beginning students typically wear a white belt, progressing through descending kyu ranks until they are deemed to have achieved a level of competence sufficient to be a dan grade, at which point they wear the .<br/>5. The kyu-dan ranking system has since been widely adopted by modern martial arts.The highest grade ever awarded ""jūdan"" (tenth degree black belt) has no formal requirements and is decided by the president of the Kodokan, currently Kano Jigoro's grandson Yukimitsu Kano.<br/>6. As of 2011, fifteen Japanese men have been promoted to this rank by the Kodokan, three of whom are still alive; the IJF and Western national federations have promoted another seven who are not recognized (at that level of rank) by the Kodokan.<br/>7. On July 28, 2011, the promotion board of USA Judo awarded Keiko Fukuda the rank of 10th ""dan"", who is the first woman to be promoted to judo's highest level, albeit not a Kodokan-recognized rank.Although ""dan"" ranks tend to be consistent between national organizations there is more variation in the ""kyū"" grades, with some countries having more ""kyū"" grades.<br/>8. Although initially ""kyū"" grade belt colours were uniformly white, today a variety of colours are used.<br/>9. The first black belts to denote a Dan rank in the 1880s, initially the wide obi was used; as practitioners trained in kimono, only white and black obi were used.<br/>10. It was not until the early 1900s, after the introduction of the judogi, that an expanded colored belt system of awarding rank was created.<br/>"
Great_Depression-Monetarist,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Great Depression<br/>Section: Monetarist<br/><br/>1. Monetarists, including Milton Friedman, argue that the Great Depression was mainly caused by monetary contraction, the consequence of poor policy-making by the American Federal Reserve System and continued crisis in the banking system.<br/>2. In this view, the Federal Reserve, by not acting, allowed the money supply as measured by the M2 to shrink by one-third from 1929–1933, thereby transforming a normal recession into the Great Depression.<br/>3. Friedman argued that the downward turn in the economy, starting with the stock market crash, would have been just another recession.The Federal Reserve allowed some large public bank failures – particularly that of the New York Bank of the United States – which produced panic and widespread runs on local banks, and the Federal Reserve sat idly by while banks collapsed.<br/>4. He claimed that, if the Fed had provided emergency lending to these key banks, or simply bought government bonds on the open market to provide liquidity and increase the quantity of money after the key banks fell, all the rest of the banks would not have fallen after the large ones did, and the money supply would not have fallen as far and as fast as it did.With significantly less money to go around, businessmen could not get new loans and could not even get their old loans renewed, forcing many to stop investing.<br/>5. This interpretation blames the Federal Reserve for inaction, especially the New York branch.One reason why the Federal Reserve did not act to limit the decline of the money supply was regulation.<br/>6. At that time, the amount of credit the Federal Reserve could issue was limited by the Federal Reserve Act, which required 40% gold backing of Federal Reserve Notes issued.<br/>7. By the late 1920s, the Federal Reserve had almost hit the limit of allowable credit that could be backed by the gold in its possession.<br/>8. This credit was in the form of Federal Reserve demand notes.A ""promise of gold"" is not as good as ""gold in the hand"", particularly when they only had enough gold to cover 40% of the Federal Reserve Notes outstanding.<br/>9. During the bank panics a portion of those demand notes were redeemed for Federal Reserve gold.<br/>10. Since the Federal Reserve had hit its limit on allowable credit, any reduction in gold in its vaults had to be accompanied by a greater reduction in credit.<br/>11. On April 5, 1933, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 6102 making the private ownership of gold certificates, coins and bullion illegal, reducing the pressure on Federal Reserve gold.<br/>"
Wrestling-History,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Wrestling<br/>Section: History<br/><br/>1. Wrestling represents one of the oldest forms of combat.<br/>2. Literary references to it occur as early as in the Iliad, in which Homer recounts the Trojan War of the 13th or 12th century BC.<br/>3. The origins of wrestling go back 15,000 years through cave drawings in France.<br/>4. Babylonian and Egyptian reliefs show wrestlers using most of the holds known in the present-day sport.In ancient Greece wrestling occupied a prominent place in legend and literature; wrestling competition, brutal in many aspects, served as the focal sport of the ancient Olympic Games.<br/>5. The ancient Romans borrowed heavily from Greek wrestling, but eliminated much of its brutality.During the Middle Ages (fifth century to fifteenth century) wrestling remained popular and enjoyed the patronage of many royal families, including those of France, Japan and England.<br/>6. Early European settlers in America brought a strong wrestling tradition with them if they came from England.<br/>7. The settlers also found wrestling to be popular among Native Americans.<br/>8. Amateur wrestling flourished throughout the early years of the North American colonies and served as a popular activity at country fairs, holiday celebrations, and in military exercises.<br/>9. The first organized national wrestling tournament took place in New York City in 1888, and wrestling has been an event at every modern Olympic Games since the 1904 games in Saint Louis, Missouri (a demonstration had been performed at the first modern Olympics).<br/>10. The International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles (FILA) originated in 1912 in Antwerp, Belgium.<br/>11. The 1st NCAA Wrestling Championships were also held in 1912, in Ames, Iowa.<br/>12. USA Wrestling, located in Colorado Springs, Colorado, became the national governing body of amateur wrestling in 1983.<br/>13. It conducts competitions for all age-levels.<br/>"

Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 78 (out of 100) based on 45 reviews from mainstream critics, considered to be ""generally favorable reviews"".<br/>4. CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film an A grade.<br/>5. ""The Telegraph"" granted the film a maximum score of five stars, stating that it is ""a superhero film without a superhero,"" comparing it with ""The Godfather Part II"" and praising Hardy's performance as well as the film's intricate plot and narrative.<br/>6. Kenneth Turan of the ""Los Angeles Times"" thought the film was ""potent, persuasive and hypnotic"" and that it was ""more than an exceptional superhero movie, it is masterful filmmaking by any standard.""<br/>7. ""The Playlists"" Todd Gilchrist wrote ""A cinematic, cultural and personal triumph, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is emotionally inspiring, aesthetically significant and critically important for America itself – as a mirror of both sober reflection and resilient hope.""<br/>8. IGN gave it a 9 out of 10, noting similarities in tone and theme to ""Batman Begins"" over the trilogy's second installment ""The Dark Knight"", but also describing Bane as ""that bit less interesting to watch"" than Ledger's Joker, despite praising his ""menacing voice"" and ""body language-driven performance"".<br/>9. ""The Guardian"" scored the film four out of five stars, calling it a film of ""granite, monolithic intensity"", yet also calling it a ""hammy, portentous affair"".<br/>10. Andrew O'Hehir of ""Salon"" writes ""if ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a fascist film, it's a great fascist film, and arguably the biggest, darkest, most thrilling and disturbing and utterly balls-out spectacle ever created for the screen"".<br/>11. Roger Ebert of the ""Chicago Sun-Times"" gave the film three out of four stars, stating ""the film begins slowly with a murky plot and too many new characters, but builds to a sensational climax.""<br/>12. Film critic Richard Roeper gave the film an ""A"", calling it ""a majestic, gorgeous, brutal and richly satisfying epic"", and citing the final scenes of the picture as ""the best five minutes of any film this year.""<br/>13. The London Film Review gave the film a B and said ""Nolan's film is a reminder that superheroes aren't merely a frivolous distraction, but an embodiment of our best selves.""<br/>14. The film was crowned by ""Forbes"" as the best modern comic book superhero adaption on screen, outranking both its main summer blockbuster competitor, ""Marvel's The Avengers"", and the trilogy's previous installment ""The Dark Knight"".<br/>15. ""The Daily Mail"" Chris Tookey said that the film was bloated and overly long, and criticized the sombre tone and lack of humor, despite praising the film's visually-impressive set pieces.<br/>16. CNN's Tom Charity said the film was a ""disappointingly clunky and bombastic conclusion to a superior series"" and called it Nolan's worst film.<br/>17. Anthony Lane of ""The New Yorker"" says that the ""story is dense, overlong, and studded with references that will make sense only to those intimate with Nolan's previous excursions into Batmanhood"".In reaction to fan backlash to some of the negative reviews, Rotten Tomatoes chose to disable user commentary for the film leading up to its release.<br/>18. Some fans had threatened violence against critics while others threatened to take down the websites of movie critics who had given the film a negative review.<br/>"

Art market.At auction.In 1973, Blue Poles ""(Blue Poles: Number 11, 1952),"" was purchased by the Australian Whitlam Government for the National Gallery of Australia for US $2 million (A$1.3 million at the time of payment).<br/>2. At the time, this was the highest price ever paid for a modern painting.<br/>3. The painting is now one of the most popular exhibits in the gallery.<br/>4. It was a centerpiece of the Museum of Modern Art's 1998 retrospective in New York, the first time the painting had been shown in America since its purchase.In November 2006, Pollock's ""No.<br/>5. 5, 1948"" became the world's most expensive painting, when it was sold privately to an undisclosed buyer for the sum of $140,000,000.<br/>6. Another artist record was established in 2004, when ""No.<br/>7. 12"" (1949), a medium-sized drip painting that had been shown in the United States Pavilion at the 1950 Venice Biennale, fetched $11.7 million at Christie's, New York.<br/>8.

Archery-A_modern_sport,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Archery<br/>Section: A modern sport<br/><br/>1. The 1840s saw the first attempts at turning the recreation into a modern sport.<br/>2. The first Grand National Archery Society meeting was held in York in 1844 and over the next decade the extravagant and festive practices of the past were gradually whittled away and the rules were standardised as the 'York Round' - a series of shoots at 60, 80, and 100 yards.<br/>3. Horace A. Ford helped to improve archery standards and pioneered new archery techniques.<br/>4. He won the Grand National 11 times in a row and published a highly influential guide to the sport in 1856.Towards the end of the 19th century, the sport experienced declining participation as alternative sports such as croquet and tennis became more popular among the middle class.<br/>5. By 1889, just 50 archery clubs were left in Britain, but it was still included as a sport at the 1900 Paris Olympics.In the United States, primitive archery was revived in the early 20th century.<br/>6. The last of the Yahi Indian tribe, a native known as Ishi, came out of hiding in California in 1911.<br/>7. His doctor, Saxton Pope, learned many of Ishi's traditional archery skills, and popularized them.<br/>8. The Pope and Young Club, founded in 1961 and named in honor of Pope and his friend, Arthur Young, became one of North America's leading bowhunting and conservation organizations.<br/>9. Founded as a nonprofit scientific organization, the Club was patterned after the prestigious Boone and Crockett Club and advocated responsible bowhunting by promoting quality, fair chase hunting, and sound conservation practices.From the 1920s, professional engineers took an interest in archery, previously the exclusive field of traditional craft experts.<br/>10. They led the commercial development of new forms of bow including the modern recurve and compound bow.<br/>11. These modern forms are now dominant in modern Western archery; traditional bows are in a minority.<br/>12. In the 1980s, the skills of traditional archery were revived by American enthusiasts, and combined with the new scientific understanding.<br/>13. Much of this expertise is available in the ""Traditional Bowyer's Bibles"" (see Additional reading).<br/>14. Modern game archery owes much of its success to Fred Bear, an American bow hunter and bow manufacturer.<br/>"
Climate_change-Plate_tectonics,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Climate change<br/>Section: Plate tectonics<br/><br/>1. Over the course of millions of years, the motion of tectonic plates reconfigures global land and ocean areas and generates topography.<br/>2. This can affect both global and local patterns of climate and atmosphere-ocean circulation.The position of the continents determines the geometry of the oceans and therefore influences patterns of ocean circulation.<br/>3. The locations of the seas are important in controlling the transfer of heat and moisture across the globe, and therefore, in determining global climate.<br/>4. A recent example of tectonic control on ocean circulation is the formation of the Isthmus of Panama about 5 million years ago, which shut off direct mixing between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.<br/>5. This strongly affected the ocean dynamics of what is now the Gulf Stream and may have led to Northern Hemisphere ice cover.<br/>6. During the Carboniferous period, about 300 to 360 million years ago, plate tectonics may have triggered large-scale storage of carbon and increased glaciation.<br/>7. Geologic evidence points to a ""megamonsoonal"" circulation pattern during the time of the supercontinent Pangaea, and climate modeling suggests that the existence of the supercontinent was conducive to the establishment of monsoons.The size of continents is also important.<br/>8. Because of the stabilizing effect of the oceans on temperature, yearly temperature variations are generally lower in coastal areas than they are inland.<br/>9. A larger supercontinent will therefore have more area in which climate is strongly seasonal than will several smaller continents or islands.<br/>"

French_fries-France_and_other_French-speaking_countries,"Category: Food<br/>Title: French fries<br/>Section: France and other French-speaking countries<br/><br/>1. In France and other French-speaking countries, fried potatoes are formally ""pommes de terre frites"", but more commonly ""pommes frites"", ""patates frites"", or simply ""frites"".<br/>2. The word """"aiguillettes"""" or ""allumettes"" is used when the chips are very small and thin.One enduring origin story holds that French Fries were invented by street vendors on the Pont Neuf bridge in Paris in 1789, just before the outbreak of the French revolution.<br/>3. Eating potatoes was promoted in France by Parmentier, but he did not mention fried potatoes in particular.Many Americans attribute the dish to France and offer as evidence a notation by U.S. President Thomas Jefferson.<br/>4. """"Pommes de terre frites à cru, en petites tranches"""" (""Potatoes deep-fried while raw, in small cuttings"") in a manuscript in Thomas Jefferson's hand (circa 1801–1809) and the recipe almost certainly comes from his French chef, Honoré Julien.In addition, from 1813 on, recipes for what can be described as French fries occur in popular American cookbooks.<br/>5. By the late 1850s, one of these uses the term ""French fried potatoes"".<br/>6. ""Frites"" are the main ingredient in the Canadian dish of Québécois descent known in both Canadian English and French as poutine, consisting of fried potatoes covered with cheese curds and gravy, a dish with a growing number of variations.<br/>"

His father runs a local hardware store.<br/>3. Scott plays basketball for his high school's team, the Beavers, with a not-so-good win-loss record.<br/>4. The girl of his dreams, Pamela Wells, is dating Mick McAllister, a jerk from an opposing high school team, the Dragons.<br/>5. After another of the team's losses, Scott begins to notice strange changes to his body.<br/>6. While at a party, Scott keeps undergoing changes and eventually he returns home, locks himself in the bathroom, and undergoes a complete change and becomes a werewolf, while his father demands that he open the door.<br/>7. He tries to refuse, only to finally give in and find his father has also transformed.<br/>8. Harold never told his son about the condition because ""sometimes it skips a generation"" and he was hoping it would not happen to Scott.<br/>9. Scott accidentally reveals his transformation to the public at one of his basketball games.<br/>10. After momentarily stunning the crowd with The Wolf, Scott goes on to amaze them with his basketball skills.Scott subsequently learns to use his family ""curse"" to gain popularity at school, becoming the team's star basketball player, and learns to transform at will between his normal self and The Wolf.<br/>11. His team goes from last to first, and Scott begins spending most of his time at school as The Wolf.<br/>12. He also wins the interest of Pamela while ignoring the affections of his best friend, Boof, who has loved him since childhood.<br/>13. One night at a school dance, however, he gets into a confrontation with Mick causing Scott to become The Wolf and claw Mick.<br/>14.

Boxing-Swarmer/in-fighter,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Boxing<br/>Section: Swarmer/in-fighter<br/><br/>1. In-fighters/swarmers (sometimes called ""pressure fighters"") attempt to stay close to an opponent, throwing intense flurries and combinations of hooks and uppercuts.<br/>2. A successful in-fighter often needs a good ""chin"" because swarming usually involves being hit with many jabs before they can maneuver inside where they are more effective.<br/>3. In-fighters operate best at close range because they are generally shorter and have less reach than their opponents and thus are more effective at a short distance where the longer arms of their opponents make punching awkward.<br/>4. However, several fighters tall for their division have been relatively adept at in-fighting as well as out-fighting.The essence of a swarmer is non-stop aggression.<br/>5. Many short in-fighters utilize their stature to their advantage, employing a bob-and-weave defense by bending at the waist to slip underneath or to the sides of incoming punches.<br/>6. Unlike blocking, causing an opponent to miss a punch disrupts his balance, permits forward movement past the opponent's extended arm and keeps the hands free to counter.<br/>7. A distinct advantage that in-fighters have is when throwing uppercuts where they can channel their entire bodyweight behind the punch; Mike Tyson was famous for throwing devastating uppercuts.<br/>8. Marvin Hagler was known for his hard ""chin"", punching power, body attack and the stalking of his opponents.<br/>9. Some in-fighters, like Mike Tyson, have been known for being notoriously hard to hit.<br/>10. The key to a swarmer is aggression, endurance, chin, and bobbing-and-weaving.Notable in-fighters include Julio César Chávez, Miguel Cotto, Joe Frazier, Danny García, Mike Tyson, Manny Pacquiao, Saúl Álvarez, Rocky Marciano, Jack Dempsey, Wayne McCullough, Harry Greb, David Tua and Ricky Hatton.<br/>"

Mexico has been traditionally among the most visited countries in the world according to the World Tourism Organization and it is the most visited country in the Americas, after the United States.<br/>2. The most notable attractions are the Meso-American ruins, cultural festivals, colonial cities, nature reserves and the beach resorts.<br/>3. The nation's temperate climate and unique culture – a fusion of the European and the Meso-American – make Mexico an attractive destination.<br/>4. The peak tourism seasons in the country are during December and the mid-Summer, with brief surges during the week before Easter and Spring break, when many of the beach resort sites become popular destinations for college students from the United States.Mexico has the 23rd highest income from tourism in the world, and the highest in Latin America.<br/>5. The vast majority of tourists come to Mexico from the United States and Canada followed by Europe and Asia.<br/>6. A smaller number also come from other Latin American countries.<br/>7. In the 2011 Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index report, Mexico was ranked 43rd in the world, which was 4th in the Americas .The coastlines of Mexico harbor many stretches of beaches that are frequented by sun bathers and other visitors.<br/>8. On the Yucatán peninsula, one of the most popular beach destinations is the resort town of Cancún, especially among university students during spring break.<br/>9. Just offshore is the beach island of Isla Mujeres, and to the east is the Isla Holbox.<br/>10. To the south of Cancun is the coastal strip called Riviera Maya which includes the beach town of Playa del Carmen and the ecological parks of Xcaret and Xel-Há.<br/>11. A day trip to the south of Cancún is the historic port of Tulum.<br/>12. In addition to its beaches, the town of Tulum is notable for its cliff-side Mayan ruins.On the Pacific coast is the notable tourist destination of Acapulco.<br/>13. Once the destination for the rich and famous, the beaches have become crowded and the shores are now home to many multi-story hotels and vendors.<br/>14. Acapulco is home to renowned cliff divers: trained divers who leap from the side of a vertical cliff into the surf below.At the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula is the resort town of Cabo San Lucas, a town noted for its beaches and marlin fishing.<br/>15.

Leonardo_da_Vinci-Paintings_of_the_1500s,"Category: Art<br/>Title: Leonardo da Vinci<br/>Section: Paintings of the 1500s<br/><br/>1. Among the works created by Leonardo in the 16th century is the small portrait known as the ""Mona Lisa"" or ""la Gioconda"", the laughing one.<br/>2. In the present era it is arguably the most famous painting in the world.<br/>3. Its fame rests, in particular, on the elusive smile on the woman's face, its mysterious quality brought about perhaps by the fact that the artist has subtly shadowed the corners of the mouth and eyes so that the exact nature of the smile cannot be determined.<br/>4. The shadowy quality for which the work is renowned came to be called ""sfumato"" or Leonardo's smoke.<br/>5. Vasari, who is generally thought to have known the painting only by repute, said that ""the smile was so pleasing that it seemed divine rather than human; and those who saw it were amazed to find that it was as alive as the original"".Other characteristics found in this work are the unadorned dress, in which the eyes and hands have no competition from other details, the dramatic landscape background in which the world seems to be in a state of flux, the subdued colouring and the extremely smooth nature of the painterly technique, employing oils, but laid on much like tempera and blended on the surface so that the brushstrokes are indistinguishable.<br/>6. Vasari expressed the opinion that the manner of painting would make even ""the most confident master ... despair and lose heart.""<br/>7. The perfect state of preservation and the fact that there is no sign of repair or overpainting is rare in a panel painting of this date.In the painting ""Virgin and Child with St. Anne"" the composition again picks up the theme of figures in a landscape which Wasserman describes as ""breathtakingly beautiful"" and harkens back to the St Jerome picture with the figure set at an oblique angle.<br/>8. What makes this painting unusual is that there are two obliquely set figures superimposed.<br/>9. Mary is seated on the knee of her mother, St Anne.<br/>10. She leans forward to restrain the Christ Child as he plays roughly with a lamb, the sign of his own impending sacrifice.<br/>11. This painting, which was copied many times, influenced Michelangelo, Raphael, and Andrea del Sarto, and through them Pontormo and Correggio.<br/>12. The trends in composition were adopted in particular by the Venetian painters Tintoretto and Veronese.<br/>"

The true extent of his collections was not discovered until after his death, when the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh took in 641 boxes of his ""Stuff.<br/>4. ""Warhol's collections included airplane menus, unpaid invoices, pizza dough, pornographic pulp novels, newspapers, stamps, supermarket flyers, and cookie jars, among other eccentricities.<br/>5.

In 1985 a girl snatched Warhol's wig off his head.<br/>8. It was later discovered in Warhol's diary entry for that day that he wrote ""I don't know what held me back from pushing her over the balcony.<br/>9.

Vietnam-Etymology,"Category: Country<br/>Title: Vietnam<br/>Section: Etymology<br/><br/>1. The name ""Việt Nam"" () is a variation of ""Nam Việt"" (; literally ""Southern Việt""), a name that can be traced back to the Triệu Dynasty of the 2nd century BC.<br/>2. The word ""Việt"" originated as a shortened form of Bách Việt (), a word applied to a group of peoples then living in southern China and Vietnam.<br/>3. The form ""Vietnam"" () is first recorded in the 16th-century oracular poem ""Sấm Trạng Trình"".<br/>4. The name has also been found on 12 steles carved in the 16th and 17th centuries, including one at Bao Lam Pagoda in Haiphong that dates to 1558.Between 1804 and 1813, the name was used officially by Emperor Gia Long.<br/>5. It was revived in the early 20th century by Phan Bội Châu's ""History of the Loss of Vietnam"", and later by the Vietnamese Nationalist Party.<br/>6. The country was usually called Annam until 1945, when both the imperial government in Huế and the Viet Minh government in Hanoi adopted ""Việt Nam"".<br/>7. Since the use of Chinese characters was discontinued in 1918, the alphabetic spelling of Vietnam is official.<br/>"

Carey re-released the song commercially in Japan in 2000, with a new remix known as the So So Def remix.<br/>3. The remix contains new vocals and is played over a harder, more urban beat; it features raps by Jermaine Dupri and Bow Wow.<br/>4. The remix appears on Carey's compilation album ""Greatest Hits"" (2001) as a bonus track.<br/>5. In 2009, a remix produced by Carey and Low Sunday, called ""Mariah's New Dance Mix"", was released.<br/>6. The mix laid the original 1994 vocals over new electronic instrumentation.<br/>7. The remix garnered a positive response.<br/>8. MTV's Kyle Anderson wrote that ""it's difficult to improve perfection,"" but that the remix ""does dress up the song in a disco thump that should make your office Christmas party 28 percent funkier than it was last year.""<br/>9. Idolator's Becky Bain praised the song's catchiness.In 2010, Carey re-recorded the song for her thirteenth studio and second holiday album, ""Merry Christmas II You"".<br/>10. Titled ""All I Want for Christmas Is You (Extra Festive)"", the new version featured re-recorded vocals, softer bell ringing and stronger drumming, and an orchestral introduction that replaced the a capella introduction.<br/>11. Steven J. Horowitz from ""Rap-Up"" wrote that the new version ""sound just as enjoyable as it did in 1994.""<br/>12. While the song was praised, it drew criticism for being too similar to the original.<br/>13. Thomas Connor from the ""Chicago Sun-Times"" wrote that the new version ""just seems to add a few brassy backup singers to the exact same arrangement.""<br/>14. Caryn Ganz from ""Rolling Stone"" agreed, writing that it was ""hard to figure out what's 'extra festive'"" about the new version.<br/>15. Dan Hancox, editor of ""The National"", also felt the new version was unnecessary.In 2011, pop singer Justin Bieber also recorded a version of the song as a duet with Carey, titled ""All I Want for Christmas Is You (Superfestive!<br/>16. )"", on his holiday album, ""Under the Mistletoe"".<br/>17.

After it was closed down in 2002, Joliet Prison became the set of ""Prison Break"" in 2005, standing in as Fox River State Penitentiary on screen.<br/>4. Scenes set in Lincoln's cell, the infirmary, and the prison yard were all shot on location at the prison.<br/>5. Lincoln's cell was alleged to be the same one in which serial killer John Wayne Gacy was incarcerated, which at least one member of the production crew refused to enter, because it was alleged to be haunted.<br/>6. Other sets were built at the prison, including the cell blocks that housed the general prison population; these blocks had three tiers of cells (as opposed to the real cell block's two) and had cells much larger than real cells to allow more space for the actors and cameras.<br/>7. Exterior scenes were filmed in areas around Chicago, Woodstock, and Joliet in Illinois.<br/>8. Other locations included O'Hare International Airport in Chicago and Toronto, Ontario in Canada.<br/>9. ""Prison Break"" spent $2 million per episode in the state of Illinois, which cost them a total of $24 million in 2005.Renewed for a second season, ""Prison Break"" resumed filming on June 15, 2006, in Dallas, Texas due to the close proximity of rural and urban settings.<br/>10. Locations within a 30-minute radius of Dallas were chosen which included Little Elm, Decatur, and Mineral Wells.<br/>11. Many of these locations were used to represent various American towns.<br/>12. The show was expected to spend in excess of $50 million in Texas over the course of the second season.<br/>13. For the final three episodes of the second season, filming took place in Pensacola, Florida to represent Panama.<br/>14. Each episode took eight days to film and approximately $1.4 million went to the local economy per episode.The third season was shot in Dallas and had a budget of $3 million per episode.<br/>15.

Set in a version of ancient China populated by anthropomorphic talking animals, the plot revolves around a bumbling panda named Po who aspires to be a kung fu master.<br/>4. When an evil kung fu warrior is foretold to escape from prison, Po is unwittingly named the chosen one destined to bring peace to the land, much to the chagrin of the resident kung fu warriors.The idea for the film was conceived by Michael Lachance, a DreamWorks Animation executive.<br/>5. The film was originally intended to be a parody, but director Stevenson decided instead to shoot an action comedy wuxia film that incorporates the hero's journey narrative archetype for the lead character.<br/>6. The computer animation in the film was more complex than anything DreamWorks had done before.<br/>7. As with most DreamWorks animated films, Hans Zimmer (collaborating with John Powell this time) scored ""Kung Fu Panda"".<br/>8.

Unbeknownst to the Americans, the Soviet moon program was in deep trouble.<br/>3. Without the N-1 rocket, the USSR had no way to land on the Moon.<br/>4. The next two Apollo missions proved that the Lunar Module worked well, both in low-Earth orbit and in lunar orbit.<br/>5. It was time to proceed to an actual landing mission.<br/>6. Under this backdrop, Apollo 11 was being prepared for a July encounter with the Moon.The Apollo 11 crew consisted of commander (CDR) Neil Armstrong, command module pilot (CMP) Michael Collins, and lunar module pilot (LMP) Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin.<br/>7. They were selected as the crew in January 1969, and they trained for the mission until just before the actual launch day.<br/>8. On July 16, 1969, at exactly 9:32 am EDT, the Saturn V rocket – serial number SA-506 – lifted off from Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida with Apollo 11 on board.The lunar trip took just over three days.<br/>9. After achieving orbit, Armstrong and Aldrin transferred into the Lunar Module, named ""Eagle"", and began their descent.<br/>10. After overcoming several computer malfunctions, Armstrong took over manual flight-control at about , and guided the Lunar Module to a landing on the Moon's Sea of Tranquility at 4:17 pm EDT, July 20, 1969.<br/>11. The first humans on the Moon would wait another six hours before they ventured out of their craft.<br/>12. At 10:56:15 pm EDT, Armstrong became the first human to set foot on the Moon.The first step was witnessed by at least 500 million TV viewers on Earth.<br/>13. His first words when he stepped off the LM's landing pad were, ""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.""<br/>14. Aldrin joined him on the surface almost 20 minutes later.<br/>15. Altogether, they spent just under two and one-quarter hours outside their craft.<br/>16. The next day, they performed the first launch from another celestial body, and rendezvoused with the ""Columbia"" Command Module.Apollo 11 safely left lunar orbit and returned to Earth, landing in the Pacific Ocean on July 24, 1969.<br/>17. When the spacecraft splashed down, 2,982 days had passed since Kennedy committed the United States to landing a man on the Moon and bringing him back safely to the Earth before the end of the decade; the mission was completed with just 161 days to spare.<br/>18. With the safe completion of the Apollo 11 mission, the Americans won the race to the Moon.This was followed by successful lunar landings on Apollo 12 (November 1969), Apollo 14 (February 1971), Apollo 15 (July 1971), Apollo 16 (April 1972), and Apollo 17 (December 1972).<br/>19.

There are only two centers in the world that are authorized by the WHO to keep stocks of smallpox virus: the Vector Institute in Russia and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States.<br/>5. However fears that it may be used as a weapon may not be totally unfounded.<br/>6. As the vaccine for smallpox sometimes had severe side-effects, it is no longer used routinely in any country.<br/>7. Thus, much of the modern human population has almost no established resistance to smallpox, and would be vulnerable to the virus.<br/>"
Turkey-Prehistory_of_Anatolia_and_Eastern_Thrace,"Category: Country<br/>Title: Turkey<br/>Section: Prehistory of Anatolia and Eastern Thrace<br/><br/>1. History.Prehistory of Anatolia and Eastern Thrace.The Anatolian peninsula, comprising most of modern Turkey, is one of the oldest permanently settled regions in the world.<br/>2. Various Ancient Anatolian populations have lived in Anatolia, beginning with the Neolithic period until conquest of Alexander the Great.<br/>3. Many of these peoples spoke the Anatolian languages, a branch of the larger Indo-European language family.<br/>4. In fact, given the antiquity of the Indo-European Hittite and Luwian languages, some scholars have proposed Anatolia as the hypothetical center from which the Indo-European languages radiated.<br/>5. European part of Turkey, called Eastern Thrace, has also been inhabited since forty thousand years ago, and is known to have been in the Neolithic era by about 6000 B.C.<br/>6. with its inhabitants starting the practice of agriculture.Göbekli Tepe is the site of the oldest known man-made religious structure, a temple dating to 10,000 BC, while Çatalhöyük is a very large Neolithic and Chalcolithic settlement in southern Anatolia, which existed from approximately 7500 BCE to 5700 BCE.<br/>7. It is the largest and best-preserved Neolithic site found to date and in July 2012 was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.<br/>8. The settlement of Troy started in the Neolithic Age and continued into the Iron Age.The earliest recorded inhabitants of Anatolia were the Hattians and Hurrians, non-Indo-European peoples who inhabited central and eastern Anatolia, respectively, as early as ca.<br/>9. 2300 BC.<br/>10. Indo-European Hittites came to Anatolia and gradually absorbed the Hattians and Hurrians ca.<br/>11. 2000–1700 BC.<br/>12. The first major empire in the area was founded by the Hittites, from the eighteenth through the 13th century BC.<br/>13. The Assyrians conquered and settled parts of southeastern Turkey as early as 1950 BC until the year 612 BC.Following the collapse of the Hittite empire c. 1180 BC, the Phrygians, an Indo-European people, achieved ascendancy in Anatolia until their kingdom was destroyed by the Cimmerians in the 7th century BC.<br/>14. The most powerful of Phrygia's successor states were Lydia, Caria and Lycia.<br/>"
Eiffel_Tower-Communications,"Category: Travel<br/>Title: Eiffel Tower<br/>Section: Communications<br/><br/>1. The tower has been used for radio transmission since the beginning of the 20th century.<br/>2. Until the 1950s, sets of antenna wires ran from the summit to anchors on the Avenue de Suffren and Champ de Mars.<br/>3. These were connected to long-wave transmitters in small bunkers; in 1909 a permanent underground radio centre was built near the south pillar, which still exists today.<br/>4. On 20 November 1913 the Paris Observatory, using the Eiffel Tower as an antenna, exchanged sustained wireless signals with the United States Naval Observatory which used an antenna in Arlington, Virginia.<br/>5. The object of the transmissions was to measure the difference in longitude between Paris and Washington, D.C. Today, both radio and television stations broadcast their signals from the top of the Eiffel Tower.<br/>"
"Michelangelo-Florence,_1499-1505","Category: Art<br/>Title: Michelangelo<br/>Section: Florence, 1499-1505<br/><br/>1. Michelangelo returned to Florence in 1499.<br/>2. The republic was changing after the fall of anti-Renaissance Priest and leader of Florence, Girolamo Savonarola, (executed in 1498) and the rise of the ""gonfaloniere"" Piero Soderini.<br/>3. He was asked by the consuls of the Guild of Wool to complete an unfinished project begun 40 years earlier by Agostino di Duccio: a colossal statue of Carrara marble portraying David as a symbol of Florentine freedom, to be placed on the gable of Florence Cathedral.<br/>4. Michelangelo responded by completing his most famous work, the Statue of David, in 1504.<br/>5. The masterwork definitively established his prominence as a sculptor of extraordinary technical skill and strength of symbolic imagination.<br/>6. A team of consultants, including Botticelli and Leonardo da Vinci, was called together to decide upon its placement, ultimately the Piazza della Signoria, in front of the Palazzo Vecchio.<br/>7. It now stands in the Academia while a replica occupies its place in the square.With the completion of the David came another commission.<br/>8. In early 1504 Leonardo da Vinci had been commissioned in the council chamber of the Palazzo Vecchio depicting the ""Battle of Angiari"" between the forces of Florence and Milan in 1434.<br/>9. Michelangelo was then commissioned to paint the ""Battle of Cascina"".<br/>10. The two paintings are very different, Leonardo's depicting soldiers fighting on horseback, and Michelangelo's showing soldiers being ambushed as they bathe in the river.<br/>11. Neither work was completed and both were lost when the chamber was refurbished.<br/>12. Both works were much admired and copies remain of them, Leonardo's work having been copied by Rubens and Michelangelo's by Bastiano da Sangallo.Also during this period, Michelangelo was commissioned by Angelo Doni to paint a ""Holy Family"" as a present for his wife, Maddalena Strozzi.<br/>13. It is known as the ""Doni Tondo"" and hangs in the Uffizi Gallery in its original magnificent frame which Michelangelo may have designed.<br/>14. He also may have painted the Madonna and Child with John the Baptist, known as the ""Manchester Madonna"" and now in the National Gallery, London, United Kingdom.<br/>"

Bacteria-Pathogens,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Bacteria<br/>Section: Pathogens<br/><br/>1. If bacteria form a parasitic association with other organisms, they are classed as pathogens.<br/>2. Pathogenic bacteria are a major cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, foodborne illness, leprosy and tuberculosis.<br/>3. A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after, as was the case with ""Helicobacter pylori"" and peptic ulcer disease.<br/>4. Bacterial diseases are also important in agriculture, with bacteria causing leaf spot, fire blight and wilts in plants, as well as Johne's disease, mastitis, salmonella and anthrax in farm animals.Each species of pathogen has a characteristic spectrum of interactions with its human hosts.<br/>5. Some organisms, such as ""Staphylococcus"" or ""Streptococcus"", can cause skin infections, pneumonia, meningitis and even overwhelming sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response producing shock, massive vasodilation and death.<br/>6. Yet these organisms are also part of the normal human flora and usually exist on the skin or in the nose without causing any disease at all.<br/>7. Other organisms invariably cause disease in humans, such as the Rickettsia, which are obligate intracellular parasites able to grow and reproduce only within the cells of other organisms.<br/>8. One species of Rickettsia causes typhus, while another causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever.<br/>9. ""Chlamydia"", another phylum of obligate intracellular parasites, contains species that can cause pneumonia, or urinary tract infection and may be involved in coronary heart disease.<br/>10. Finally, some species such as ""Pseudomonas aeruginosa"", ""Burkholderia cenocepacia"", and ""Mycobacterium avium"" are opportunistic pathogens and cause disease mainly in people suffering from immunosuppression or cystic fibrosis.Bacterial infections may be treated with antibiotics, which are classified as bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria, or bacteriostatic if they just prevent bacterial growth.<br/>11. There are many types of antibiotics and each class inhibits a process that is different in the pathogen from that found in the host.<br/>12. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are chloramphenicol and puromycin, which inhibit the bacterial ribosome, but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome.<br/>13. Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations.<br/>14. Infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as sterilizing the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters.<br/>15. Surgical and dental instruments are also sterilized to prevent contamination by bacteria.<br/>16. Disinfectants such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection.<br/>"
Telescope-Gamma-ray_telescopes,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Telescope<br/>Section: Gamma-ray telescopes<br/><br/>1. Higher energy X-ray and Gamma-ray telescopes refrain from focusing completely and use coded aperture masks: the patterns of the shadow the mask creates can be reconstructed to form an image.X-ray and Gamma-ray telescopes are usually on Earth-orbiting satellites or high-flying balloons since the Earth's atmosphere is opaque to this part of the electromagnetic spectrum.<br/>2. However, high energy X-rays and gamma-rays do not form an image in the same way as telescopes at visible wavelengths.<br/>3. An example of this type of telescope is the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.The detection of very high energy gamma rays, with shorter wavelength and higher frequency than regular gamma rays, requires further specialization.<br/>4. An example of this type of observatory is VERITAS.<br/>5. Very high energy gamma-rays are still photons, like visible light, whereas cosmic rays includes particles like electrons, protons, and heavier nuclei.A discovery in 2012 may allow focusing gamma-ray telescopes.<br/>6. At photon energies greater than 700 keV, the index of refraction starts to increase again.<br/>"
Microscope-Optical,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Microscope<br/>Section: Optical<br/><br/>1. The most common type of microscope (and the first invented) is the optical microscope.<br/>2. This is an optical instrument containing one or more lenses producing an enlarged image of a sample placed in the focal plane.<br/>3. Optical microscopes have refractive glass and occasionally of plastic or quartz, to focus light into the eye or another light detector.<br/>4. Mirror-based optical microscopes operate in the same manner.<br/>5. Typical magnification of a light microscope, assuming visible range light, is up to 1250x with a theoretical resolution limit of around 0.250 micrometres or 250 nanometres.<br/>6. This limits the practical magnification limit to ~1500x.<br/>7. Specialized techniques (e.g., scanning confocal microscopy, Vertico SMI) may exceed this magnification but the resolution is diffraction limited.<br/>8. The use of shorter wavelengths of light, such as the ultraviolet, is one way to improve the spatial resolution of the optical microscope, as are devices such as the near-field scanning optical microscope.Sarfus, a recent optical technique increases the sensitivity of standard optical microscope to a point it becomes possible to directly visualize nanometric films (down to 0.3 nanometre) and isolated nano-objects (down to 2 nm-diameter).<br/>9. The technique is based on the use of non-reflecting substrates for cross-polarized reflected light microscopy.Ultraviolet light enables the resolution of microscopic features, as well as to image samples that are transparent to the eye.<br/>10. Near infrared light can be used to visualize circuitry embedded in bonded silicon devices, since silicon is transparent in this region of wavelengths.In fluorescence microscopy, many wavelengths of light, ranging from the ultraviolet to the visible can be used to cause samples to fluoresce to allow viewing by eye or with the use of specifically sensitive cameras.Phase contrast microscopy is an optical microscopy illumination technique in which small phase shifts in the light passing through a transparent specimen are converted into amplitude or contrast changes in the image.The use of phase contrast does not require staining to view the slide.<br/>11. This microscope technique made it possible to study the cell cycle in live cells.The traditional optical microscope has more recently evolved into the digital microscope.<br/>12. In addition to, or instead of, directly viewing the object through the eyepieces, a type of sensor similar to those used in a digital camera is used to obtain an image, which is then displayed on a computer monitor.<br/>13. These sensors may use CMOS or charge-coupled device (CCD) technology, depending on the application.<br/>"
Badminton-Doubles,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Badminton<br/>Section: Doubles<br/><br/>1. Both pairs will try to gain and maintain the attack, smashing downwards when possible.<br/>2. Whenever possible, a pair will adopt an ideal attacking formation with one player hitting down from the rearcourt, and his partner in the midcourt intercepting all smash returns except the lift.<br/>3. If the rearcourt attacker plays a dropshot, his partner will move into the forecourt to threaten the net reply.<br/>4. If a pair cannot hit downwards, they will use flat strokes in an attempt to gain the attack.<br/>5. If a pair is forced to lift or clear the shuttlecock, then they must defend: they will adopt a side-by-side position in the rear midcourt, to cover the full width of their court against the opponents' smashes.<br/>6. In doubles, players generally smash to the middle ground between two players in order to take advantage of confusion and clashes.At high levels of play, the backhand serve has become popular to the extent that forehand serves have become fairly rare at a high level of play.<br/>7. The straight low serve is used most frequently, in an attempt to prevent the opponents gaining the attack immediately.<br/>8. Flick serves are used to prevent the opponent from anticipating the low serve and attacking it decisively.At high levels of play, doubles rallies are extremely fast.<br/>9. Men's doubles is the most aggressive form of badminton, with a high proportion of powerful jump smashes and very quick reflex exchanges.<br/>10. Because of this, spectator interest is sometimes greater for men's doubles than for singles.<br/>"
Terminator_Salvation-Writing,"Category: Movies<br/>Title: Terminator Salvation<br/>Section: Writing<br/><br/>1. McG signed on to direct as the first two films were among his favorites, and he had even cast Robert Patrick (who played the T-1000) in his films.<br/>2. Though he was initially unsure about ""flogging a dead horse,"" he felt the post-apocalyptic setting allowed the film to be different enough so as not to be just an inferior sequel.<br/>3. The idea that events in ' and ' altered the future also allowed them to be flexible with their presentation of the futuristic world.<br/>4. McG met with the series' co-creator James Cameron, and, although he neither blessed nor denigrated the project, Cameron told the new director he had faced a similar challenge when following Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" with ""Aliens"".<br/>5. He maintained two elements of the previous films; that John is an outsider to the authorities, and someone of future importance is being protected, and in this film it is Kyle Reese.The first full screenplay for the film was written by """" writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris, who received full screenplay credit.<br/>6. Paul Haggis rewrote Brancato and Ferris's script, and Shawn Ryan made another revision three weeks before filming.<br/>7. Jonathan Nolan also wrote on set, which led to McG characterizing his work on the script as the most important; he chose to contribute to the film after Bale signed on and created Connor's arc of becoming a leader.<br/>8. Anthony E. Zuiker contributed to the script as well.<br/>9. So extensive were the rewrites that Alan Dean Foster decided to rewrite the entire novelization after submitting it to his publisher, because the compiled shooting script was very different from the one he was given beforehand.In the early script drafts, John was a secondary character.<br/>10. Producer James Middleton explained """""" was influenced by Jesus Christ, but it was his story.<br/>11. Much in that way, this main character will be influenced by John Connor.""<br/>12. The original ending was to have John killed, and his image kept alive by the resistance by grafting his skin onto Marcus' cybernetic body.<br/>13. However, after the ending was leaked on the Internet, Warner Bros. decided to completely change the entire third act of the film.<br/>14. McG and Nolan did continue the Christ element of John's character though, in which he has some followers who believe what he knows about Skynet, and others who do not.McG described the film's theme as ""where you draw the line between machines and humans"".<br/>15. The friendship between Marcus — who was executed (for murder) when humanity still ruled the world — and Kyle Reese illustrates how war and suffering can bring out the best in people, such as when they worked together to survive during the Blitz.<br/>16. The title was derived from this second chance given to humanity and to Marcus, in addition to John's efforts to save humanity from the machines.<br/>17. The film's original title was ""Terminator Salvation: The Future Begins"", but this was dropped during filming.Throughout writing, the cast and crew would watch scenes from the three films to pick moments to reference or tribute, including ""Come with me if you want to live"" and ""I'll be back"", which is uttered by John in this film.<br/>18. McG found himself having to decide which ideas for references would be included and which would not.<br/>19. An opening scene has John fighting a Terminator on a crashed helicopter, which was storyboarded as a homage to the climax of the original film, where his mother Sarah, having broken her leg, is chased by a crippled Terminator.<br/>20. McG did this to reflect the skills John learned from her.<br/>"

World_War_II-Axis_attack_on_the_USSR_(1941),"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: World War II<br/>Section: Axis attack on the USSR (1941)<br/><br/>1. Axis attack on the USSR (1941).With the situation in Europe and Asia relatively stable, Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union made preparations.<br/>2. With the Soviets wary of mounting tensions with Germany and the Japanese planning to take advantage of the European War by seizing resource-rich European possessions in Southeast Asia, the two powers signed the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1941.<br/>3. By contrast, the Germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the Soviet Union, amassing forces on the Soviet border.Hitler believed that Britain's refusal to end the war was based on the hope that the United States and the Soviet Union would enter the war against Germany sooner or later.<br/>4. He accordingly decided to try to strengthen Germany's relations with the Soviets, or failing that, to attack and eliminate them as a factor.<br/>5. In November 1940 negotiations took place to determine if the Soviet Union would join the Tripartite Pact.<br/>6. The Soviets showed some interest, but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan that Germany considered unacceptable.<br/>7. On 18 December 1940 Hitler issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the Soviet Union.On 22 June 1941, Germany, Italy and Romania invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, with Germany accusing the Soviets of plotting against them.<br/>8. They were joined shortly by Finland and Hungary.<br/>9. The primary targets of this surprise offensive were the Baltic region, Moscow and Ukraine, with the ultimate goal of ending the 1941 campaign near the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan line, from the Caspian to the White Seas.<br/>10. Hitler's objectives were to eliminate the Soviet Union as a military power, exterminate Communism, generate ""Lebensraum"" (""living space"") by dispossessing the native population and guarantee access to the strategic resources needed to defeat Germany's remaining rivals.Although the Red Army was preparing for strategic counter-offensives before the war, ""Barbarossa"" forced the Soviet supreme command to adopt a strategic defence.<br/>11. During the summer, the Axis made significant gains into Soviet territory, inflicting immense losses in both personnel and materiel.<br/>12. By the middle of August, however, the German Army High Command decided to suspend the offensive of a considerably depleted Army Group Centre, and to divert the 2nd Panzer Group to reinforce troops advancing towards central Ukraine and Leningrad.<br/>13. The Kiev offensive was overwhelmingly successful, resulting in encirclement and elimination of four Soviet armies, and made further advance into Crimea and industrially developed Eastern Ukraine (the First Battle of Kharkov) possible.The diversion of three quarters of the Axis troops and the majority of their air forces from France and the central Mediterranean to the Eastern Front prompted Britain to reconsider its grand strategy.<br/>14. In July, the UK and the Soviet Union formed a military alliance against Germany The British and Soviets invaded Iran to secure the Persian Corridor and Iran's oil fields.<br/>15. In August, the United Kingdom and the United States jointly issued the Atlantic Charter.By October, when Axis operational objectives in Ukraine and the Baltic region were achieved, with only the sieges of Leningrad and Sevastopol continuing, a major offensive against Moscow had been renewed.<br/>16. After two months of fierce battles, the German army almost reached the outer suburbs of Moscow, where the exhausted troops were forced to suspend their offensive.<br/>17. Large territorial gains were made by Axis forces, but their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives: two key cities remained in Soviet hands, the Soviet capability to resist was not broken, and the Soviet Union retained a considerable part of its military potential.<br/>18. The ""blitzkrieg"" phase of the war in Europe had ended.By early December, freshly mobilised reserves allowed the Soviets to achieve numerical parity with Axis troops.<br/>19. This, as well as intelligence data that established a minimal number of Soviet troops in the East sufficient to prevent any attack by the Japanese Kwantung Army, allowed the Soviets to begin a massive counter-offensive that started on 5 December all along the front and pushed German troops west.<br/>"
Table_tennis-Ball,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Table tennis<br/>Section: Ball<br/><br/>1. Equipment.Ball.The international rules specify that the game is played with a light 2.7 gram, 40 mm diameter ball.<br/>2. The rules say that the ball shall bounce up 24–26 cm when dropped from a height of 30.5 cm onto a standard steel block thereby having a coefficient of restitution of 0.89 to 0.92.<br/>3. The 40 mm ball was introduced after the 2000 Olympic Games.<br/>4. However, this created some controversy as the Chinese National Team argued that this was merely to give non-Chinese players a better chance of winning since the new type of balls has a slower speed, while at that time most Chinese players were playing with fast attack and smashes.<br/>5. A 40 mm table tennis ball is slower and spins less than the original 38 mm (1.5 inch) one.<br/>6. The ball is made of a high-bouncing air-filled celluloid or similar plastics material, colored white or orange, with a matte finish.<br/>7. The choice of ball color is made according to the table color and its surroundings.<br/>8. For example, a white ball is easier to see on a green or blue table than it is on a gray table.<br/>9. Some Table Tennis balls have ball rated in stars so that more professional players can know which ball to use.Manufacturers often indicate the quality of the ball with a star-rating system, usually from one to three, three being the highest grade.<br/>10. As this system is not standard across manufacturers, the only way a ball may be used in official competition is upon ITTF approval.<br/>11. The ITTF approval can be seen printed on the ball.<br/>"
Friends-Broadcast,"Category: Tv<br/>Title: Friends<br/>Section: Broadcast<br/><br/>1. Distribution.Broadcast.After the produced pilot lived up to NBC's hopes, the series premiered with the name ""Friends"" on September 22, 1994 in the coveted Thursday 8:30 p.m. timeslot.<br/>2. The pilot aired between ""Mad About You"" and ""Seinfeld"", and was watched by almost 22 million American viewers.<br/>3. The series was a huge success throughout its run, and was a staple of NBC's Thursday night line-up, dubbed by the network as Must See TV.<br/>4. When Crane told reporters in 2001 that the ninth season was a possibility, critics believed that he was posturing, and that at least two of the cast members would not sign on for another season.<br/>5. When it was confirmed that ""Friends"" would return for a ninth season, the news was mainly about the amount of money—$7 million per episode—that it took to bring the series back for another season.After year-long expectations that the ninth season would be the series' last, NBC signed a deal in late December 2002 to bring the series back for a final tenth season.<br/>6. The series' creative team did not want to extend negotiations into the next year, and wanted to start writing the rest of the ninth season episodes and a potential series finale.<br/>7. NBC agreed to pay $10 million to Warner Bros. for the production of each tenth season episode, the highest price in television history for a 30-minute series.<br/>8. Although NBC was unable to bring in enough advertising revenue from commercials to cover the costs, the series was integral to the Thursday night schedule, which brought high ratings and profits to the other television series.<br/>9. The cast demanded that the tenth season be reduced from the usual 24 episodes to 18 episodes to allow them to work on outside projects.In fall 2001, Warner Bros.<br/>10. Domestic Cable made a deal with sister network TBS (both are owned by Time Warner) to air the series in rerun syndication.<br/>11. Warner Bros.<br/>12. Domestic Cable announced that it had sold additional cable rights to ""Friends"" to Nick at Nite which began airing in the fall of 2011 (unlike the TBS and broadcast syndication airings, Nick at Nite broadcasts of the series, which began airing as part of a seven-night launch marathon on September 5, 2011, replace the end credit tag scenes with marginalized credits featuring promotions for the series and other Nick at Nite programs).<br/>13. Warner Bros. was expected to make $200 million in license fees and advertising from the deal.<br/>14. Nick at Nite paid $500,000 per episode to air the episodes after 6 p.m.<br/>15. ET for six years through fall 2017.<br/>16. TBS also renewed its contract for the same six-year period as Nick at Nite but paid $275,000 per episode because airings were restricted to before 6 p.m.<br/>17. ET except for the first year.<br/>18. In syndication until 2005, ""Friends"" had earned $4 million per episode in cash license fees for a total of $944 million.Beginning on March 5, 2012, high definition versions of all 236 ""Friends"" episodes were made available to local broadcast stations, starting with the pilot episode.<br/>19. For the remastered episodes, Warner Bros. restored previously cropped images on the left and right sides of the screen, using the original 35 mm film source, to use the entire widescreen frame.<br/>20.

Dora_Maar_au_Chat-Descriptions_of_painting,"Category: Art<br/>Title: Dora Maar au Chat<br/>Section: Descriptions of painting<br/><br/>1. <br/>2. ""Dora Maar au Chat"" presents the artist's most mysterious and challenging mistress regally posed three-quarter length in a large wooden chair with a small black cat perched behind her in both an amusing and menacing attitude.<br/>3. The faceted planes of her body and richly layered surface of brushstrokes impart a monumental and sculptural quality to this portrait.<br/>4. The painting is also remarkable for its brilliance of colour and the complex and dense patterning of the model's dress.<br/>5. The powerful figure is set in a dramatic, yet simple setting composed of a vertiginously inclined plane of wooden floorboards and shallow interior space that is arranged in a manner reminiscent of Picasso’s earliest manipulations of space in a cubist manner.<br/>6. ""Dora Maar au Chat"" is one of Picasso’s most valued depictions of his lover and artistic companion.<br/>7. Their partnership had been one of intellectual exchange and intense passion—Dora was an artist, spoke Picasso’s native Spanish, and shared his political concerns.<br/>8. She even assisted with the execution of the monumental ""Guernica"" and produced the only photo-documentary of the work in progress.<br/>9. She was an intellectual force – a characteristic that both stimulated and challenged Picasso and her influence on him resulted in some of his most powerful and daring portraits of his 75-year career.<br/>10. Among the best of them are the oils completed during the late 1930s and early 1940s, when Picasso’s art resonated with the drama and emotional upheaval of the era and which Dora came to personify.<br/>11. The luminous ""Dora Maar au Chat"" was painted in 1941, at the beginning of the Second World War in France .Maar was one of the most influential figures in Picasso’s life during their relationship and she also became his primary model.<br/>12. By the time he painted the present picture he had incorporated Dora Maar’s image into countless versions of this motif.<br/>13. During the occupation of Paris by the Nazis, and as tension mounted in their relationship, the artist would express his frustration by furiously abstracting her image, often portraying her in tears.<br/>14. While the present portrait might seem a departure from Picasso's more hostile depictions of this model, it may be one of his most brilliant and biting provocations of his ""Weeping Woman"".<br/>15. Picasso once likened Maar’s allure and temperament to that of an “Afghan cat”, and the cat in this picture is laden with significance.<br/>16. In the history of art, the pairing of cats and women was an allusion to feminine wiles and sexual aggression, as exemplified in Manet’s notorious ""Olympia"".<br/>17. It is also interesting to consider that the artist has paid particular attention to the sharp, talon-like nails on the long fingers of his model.<br/>18. In life Maar’s well-manicured hands were one of her most beautiful and distinctive features, and here they have taken on another, more violent characteristic.In addition to being a rare, three-quarter length portrait of Dora Maar, the present work is also a generous and painterly composition with an extraordinary attention to detail.<br/>19. The artist used an extraordinarily vibrant palette in his rendering of the angles of the chair and the patterning of Maar’s dress.<br/>20. The most embellished and symbolic element of the sitter’s wardrobe in this picture is her hat, Maar’s most famous accessory and signifier of her involvement in the Surrealist movement.<br/>21. Ceremoniously placed atop her head like a crown, it is festooned with colourful plumes and outlined with a band of vibrant red.<br/>22. Larger than life, an impression enhanced by her vibrant body that cannot be confined by the boundaries of the chair, Maar looms in this picture like a pagan goddess seated on her throne.<br/>"
Stone_Mountain-Geology,"Category: Travel<br/>Title: Stone Mountain<br/>Section: Geology<br/><br/>1. Stone Mountain is a pluton, a type of igneous intrusion.<br/>2. Primarily composed of quartz monzonite, the dome of Stone Mountain was formed during the formation of the Blue Ridge Mountains, part of the Appalachian Mountains.<br/>3. It formed as a result of the upwelling of magma from within the Earth's crust.<br/>4. This magma solidified to form granite within the crust five to ten miles below the surface.<br/>5. Stone Mountain pluton continues underground at its longest point into Gwinnett County.<br/>6. Numerous reference books and Georgia literature have dubbed Stone Mountain as “the largest exposed piece of granite in the world"".<br/>7. This misnomer is most likely a result of advertisement by granite companies and early park administration.<br/>8. Stone Mountain, though often called a pink granite dome, actually ranges in composition from quartz monzonite to granite and granodiorite.The minerals within the rock include quartz, plagioclase feldspar, microcline and muscovite, with smaller amounts of biotite and tourmaline.<br/>9. The tourmaline is mostly black in color, and the majority of it exists as optically continuous skeletal crystals, but much larger, euhedral pegmatitic tourmaline crystals can also be found in the mountain's numerous, cross-cutting felsic dikes.Embedded in the granite are xenoliths or pieces of foreign rocks entrained in the magma.The granite intruded into the metamorphic rocks of the Piedmont region during the last stages of the Alleghenian Orogeny, which was the time when North America and North Africa collided.<br/>10. Over time, erosion eventually exposed the present mountain of more resistant igneous rock.<br/>11. This intrusion of granite also gave rise to Panola Mountain in DeKalb County, smaller outcroppings further east of Stone Mountain.<br/>"
Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa-Construction,"Category: Travel<br/>Title: Leaning Tower of Pisa<br/>Section: Construction<br/><br/>1. Construction of the tower occurred in three stages across 199 years.<br/>2. Work on the ground floor of the white marble campanile began on August 14, 1173, during a period of military success and prosperity.<br/>3. This ground floor is a blind arcade articulated by engaged columns with classical Corinthian capitals.The tower began to sink after construction had progressed to the second floor in 1178.<br/>4. This was due to a mere three-metre foundation, set in weak, unstable subsoil, a design that was flawed from the beginning.<br/>5. Construction was subsequently halted for almost a century, because the Republic of Pisa was almost continually engaged in battles with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence.<br/>6. This allowed time for the underlying soil to settle.<br/>7. Otherwise, the tower would almost certainly have toppled.<br/>8. In 1198 clocks were temporarily installed on the third floor of the unfinished construction.In 1272 construction resumed under Giovanni di Simone, architect of the Camposanto.<br/>9. In an effort to compensate for the tilt, the engineers built upper floors with one side taller than the other.<br/>10. Because of this, the tower is actually curved.<br/>11. Construction was halted again in 1284, when the Pisans were defeated by the Genoans in the Battle of Meloria.The seventh floor was completed in 1319.<br/>12. It was built by Tommaso di Andrea Pisano, who succeeded in harmonizing the Gothic elements of the bell-chamber with the Romanesque style of the tower.<br/>13. There are seven bells, one for each note of the musical major scale.<br/>14. The largest one was installed in 1655.<br/>15. The bell-chamber was finally added in 1372.After a phase (1990–2001) of structural strengthening, the tower is currently undergoing gradual surface restoration, in order to repair visible damage, mostly corrosion and blackening.<br/>16. These are particularly pronounced due to the tower's age and its exposure to wind and rain.<br/>"
Das_Boot-Criticism_by_novelist_Buchheim,"Category: Movies<br/>Title: Das Boot<br/>Section: Criticism by novelist Buchheim<br/><br/>1. Even though impressed by the technological accuracy of the film's set-design and port construction buildings, novelist Lothar-Günter Buchheim expressed great disappointment with Petersen's adaptation in a film review published in 1981, especially with Petersen's aesthetic vision for the film and the way the plot and the effects are, according to him, overdone and clichéd by the adaptation.<br/>2. He also criticised the hysterical overacting of the cast, which he called highly unrealistic, while acknowledging the cast's acting talent in general.<br/>3. Buchheim, after several attempts for an American adaptation had failed, had provided a script detailing his own narrative, cinematographical and photographical ideas as soon as Petersen was chosen as new director.<br/>4. It would have amounted in full to a complete six-hour epic; however, Petersen turned him down because at the time the producers were aiming for a 90-minute feature for international release.<br/>5. However, today's Director's Cut of ""Das Boot"" amounts to over 200 minutes, and the complete TV version of the film is 282 minutes long.Buchheim, himself a U-boat correspondent, attacked specifically what he called Petersen's sacrificing of both realism and suspense in dialogue, narration, and photography for the sake of cheap dramatic thrills and action effects (for example, in reality one single exploding bolt of the boat's pressure hull would have been enough for the whole crew to worry about the U-boat being crushed by water pressure, while Petersen has several bolts loosening in various scenes).<br/>6. Buchheim also criticized depictions of the crew's loud behaviour during patrols as unrealistic and celebrations after achieving a torpedo hit or surviving a bombing as unprofessional.<br/>7. Furthermore, an officer—even an outsider like Lt. Werner—would have commanded special respect and that throwing an oil-drenched towel into his face would not have been tolerated.Uttering concerns about the end result, Buchheim felt that unlike his clearly anti-war novel the adaptation was ""another re-glorification and re-mystification"" of the German World War II U-boat war, German heroism and nationalism.<br/>8. He called the film a cross between a ""cheap, shallow American action flick"" and a ""contemporary German propaganda newsreel from World War II"".<br/>"
Baseball-Batting_and_baserunning_tactics,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Baseball<br/>Section: Batting and baserunning tactics<br/><br/>1. Several basic offensive tactics come into play with a runner on first base, including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base.<br/>2. The hit and run is sometimes employed with a skillful contact hitter: the runner takes off with the pitch drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating a gap in the infield for the batter to poke the ball through.<br/>3. The sacrifice bunt calls for the batter to focus on making contact with the ball so that it rolls a short distance into the infield, allowing the runner to advance into scoring position even at the expense of the batter being thrown out at first—a batter who succeeds is credited with a sacrifice.<br/>4. (A batter, particularly one who is a fast runner, may also attempt to bunt for a hit.)<br/>5. A sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base, aimed at bringing that runner home, is known as a squeeze play.<br/>6. With a runner on third and fewer than two outs, a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be deep enough to allow the runner to tag up and score—a successful batter in this case gets credit for a sacrifice fly.<br/>7. The manager will sometimes signal a batter who is ahead in the count (i.e., has more balls than strikes) to take, or not swing at, the next pitch.<br/>"
Free_Bird-Legacy,"Category: Music<br/>Title: Free Bird<br/>Section: Legacy<br/><br/>1. It has become something of a humorous tradition for audience members at concerts to shout ""Free Bird"" as a request to hear the song, regardless of the performer or style of music.<br/>2. The phenomenon began earlier in the 1970s with The Allman Brothers Band's epic ""Whipping Post"", but then took off to a much greater extent with ""Free Bird"", which was very popular by 1979.<br/>3. This can be traced back to Skynyrd's first live album, 1976's ""One More from the Road"".<br/>4. For their second encore, Van Zant asked the crowd, ""What song is it you wanna hear?<br/>5. "", which was immediately followed by several shouts of ""Free Bird"", to which the band responded with a 14-minute rendition of the song.<br/>6. The spoken interaction was reproduced on the album as an introduction to the song.<br/>"

Henri_Matisse-The_war_years,"Category: Art<br/>Title: Henri Matisse<br/>Section: The war years<br/><br/>1. He and his wife of 41 years separated in 1939.<br/>2. In 1941, he underwent surgery in which a colostomy was performed.<br/>3. Afterwards he started using a wheelchair, and until his death he was cared for by a Russian woman, Lydia Delektorskaya, formerly one of his models.<br/>4. With the aid of assistants he set about creating cut paper collages, often on a large scale, called ""gouaches découpés"".<br/>5. His Blue Nudes series feature prime examples of this technique he called ""painting with scissors""; they demonstrate the ability to bring his eye for colour and geometry to a new medium of utter simplicity, but with playful and delightful power.In the 1940s he also worked as a graphic artist and produced black-and-white illustrations for several books and over one hundred original lithographs at the Mourlot Studios in Paris.In 1941, a nursing student named Monique Bourgeois responded to an ad placed by Matisse for a nurse.<br/>6. A platonic friendship developed between Matisse and Bourgeois.<br/>7. He discovered that she was an amateur artist, and taught her about perspective.<br/>8. After Bourgeois left the position, Matisse sometimes contacted her to request that she model for him.<br/>9. Bourgeois became a Dominican nun in 1946.Matisse was much admired and repeatedly referred to by the Greek Nobelist poet Odysseas Elytis.<br/>10. Elytis was introduced to Matisse through their common friend Tériade, during the work on the ""Cutouts"".<br/>11. Matisse had painted the wall of the dining room of Tériade's residence, the ""Villa Natacha"" in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, which Elytis also mentioned in his poems.Matisse, thoroughly unpolitical, was shocked when he heard that his daughter Marguerite, who had been active in the Résistance during the war, was tortured (almost to death) in a Rennes prison and sentenced to the Ravensbrück concentration camp.<br/>12. (Marguerite avoided further imprisonment by escaping from the Ravensbrück-bound train, which was halted during an Allied air strike; she survived in the woods until rescued by fellow resisters.<br/>13. )Matisse's student Rudolf Levy was killed in the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1944.In 1947 he published ""Jazz"", a limited-edition artist's book of about one hundred prints of colourful paper cut collages, accompanied by his written thoughts.<br/>14.

Association_football-Pitch,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Association football<br/>Section: Pitch<br/><br/>1. As the Laws were formulated in England, and were initially administered solely by the four British football associations within IFAB, the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in imperial units.<br/>2. The Laws now express dimensions with approximate metric equivalents (followed by traditional units in brackets), though popular use tends to continue to use traditional units in English-speaking countries with a relatively recent history of metrication (or only partial metrication), such as Britain.The length of the pitch for international adult matches is in the range of 100–110 m (110–120 yd) and the width is in the range of 64–75 m (70–80 yd).<br/>3. Fields for non-international matches may be 90–120 m (100–130 yd) length and 45–90 m (50–100 yd) in width, provided that the pitch does not become square.<br/>4. In 2008, the IFAB initially approved a fixed size of 105 m (344 ft) long and 68 m (223 ft) wide as a standard pitch dimension for international matches; however, this decision was later put on hold and was never actually implemented.The longer boundary lines are ""touchlines"", while the shorter boundaries (on which the goals are placed) are ""goal lines"".<br/>5. A rectangular goal is positioned at the middle of each goal line.<br/>6. The inner edges of the vertical goal posts must be 7.32 m (8 yd) apart, and the lower edge of the horizontal crossbar supported by the goal posts must be 2.44 m (8 ft) above the ground.<br/>7. Nets are usually placed behind the goal, but are not required by the Laws.In front of each goal is an area known as the penalty area.<br/>8. This area is marked by the goal line, two lines starting on the goal line 16.5 m (18 yd) from the goalposts and extending 16.5 m (18 yd) into the pitch perpendicular to the goal line, and a line joining them.<br/>9. This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul by a member of the defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick.<br/>10. Other markings define the position of the ball or players at kick-offs, goal kicks, penalty kicks and corner kicks.<br/>"
Aurora-Auroral_mechanism,"Category: Science<br/>Title: Aurora<br/>Section: Auroral mechanism<br/><br/>1. l mechanism.Auroras are associated with the solar wind, a flow of ions continuously flowing outward from the Sun.<br/>2. The Earth's magnetic field traps these particles, many of which travel toward the poles where they are accelerated toward Earth.<br/>3. Collisions between these ions and atmospheric atoms and molecules cause energy releases in the form of auroras appearing in large circles around the poles.<br/>4. Auroras are more frequent and brighter during the intense phase of the solar cycle when coronal mass ejections increase the intensity of the solar wind.Auroras result from emissions of photons in the Earth's upper atmosphere, above , from ionized nitrogen molecules regaining an electron, and oxygen atoms and nitrogen molecules returning from an excited state to ground state.<br/>5. They are ionized or excited by the collision of solar wind and magnetospheric particles being funneled down and accelerated along the Earth's magnetic field lines; excitation energy is lost by the emission of a photon, or by collision with another atom or molecule:<br/>6. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oxygen emissions: green or brownish-red, depending on the amount of energy absorbed.<br/>7. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nitrogen emissions: blue or red; blue if the atom regains an electron after it has been ionized, red if returning to ground state from an excited state.<br/><br/>8. Oxygen is unusual in terms of its return to ground state: it can take three quarters of a second to emit green light and up to two minutes to emit red.</br>9. Collisions with other atoms or molecules absorb the excitation energy and prevent emission.<br/>10. Because the very top of the atmosphere has a higher percentage of oxygen and is sparsely distributed such collisions are rare enough to allow time for oxygen to emit red.<br/>11. Collisions become more frequent progressing down into the atmosphere, so that red emissions do not have time to happen, and eventually even green light emissions are prevented.This is why there is a color differential with altitude; at high altitude oxygen red dominates, then oxygen green and nitrogen blue/red, then finally nitrogen blue/red when collisions prevent oxygen from emitting anything.<br/>12. Green is the most common of all auroras.<br/>13. Behind it is pink, a mixture of light green and red, followed by pure red, yellow (a mixture of red and green), and finally, pure blue.<br/>"

Victoria_Falls-Tourism_in_recent_years,"Category: Travel<br/>Title: Victoria Falls<br/>Section: Tourism in recent years<br/><br/>1. By the end of the 1990s almost 300,000 people were visiting the falls annually, and this was expected to rise to over a million in the next decade.<br/>2. Unlike the game parks, Victoria Falls has more Zimbabwean and Zambian visitors than international tourists; the attraction is accessible by bus and train, and is therefore comparatively inexpensive to reach.The two countries permit tourists to make day trips from each side and visas can be obtained at the border posts.<br/>3. Costs vary from US$45-US$80 (as of 01 December 2013).<br/>4. Visitors with single entry visas will need to purchase a visa each time they cross the border.<br/>5. Regular changes in visa regulations mean visitors should check the rules before crossing the border.<br/>6. A famous feature is the naturally formed Devil's Pool, near the edge of the falls on Livingstone Island on the Zambian side.<br/>7. When the river flow is at a certain level, usually between September and December, a rock barrier forms an eddy with minimal current, allowing adventurous swimmers to splash around in relative safety a few feet from the point where the water cascades over the falls.<br/>8. Occasional deaths have been reported when people have slipped over the rock barrier.The numbers of visitors to the Zimbabwean side of the falls has historically been much higher than the number visiting the Zambia side, due to the greater development of the visitor facilities there.<br/>9. However, the number of tourists visiting Zimbabwe began to decline in the early 2000s as political tensions between supporters and opponents of president Robert Mugabe increased.<br/>10. In 2006, hotel occupancy on the Zimbabwean side hovered at around 30%, while the Zambian side was at near-capacity, with rates in top hotels reaching US$630 per night.<br/>11. The rapid development has prompted the United Nations to consider revoking the Falls' status as a World Heritage Site.<br/>12. In addition, problems of waste disposal and a lack of effective management of the falls' environment are a concern.<br/>"

Early National Park Service years (1933–1982).In 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt ordered the statue transferred to the National Park Service (NPS).<br/>2. In 1937, the NPS gained jurisdiction over the rest of Bedloe's Island.<br/>3. With the Army's departure, the NPS began to transform the island into a park.<br/>4. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) demolished most of the old buildings, regraded and reseeded the eastern end of the island, and built granite steps for a new public entrance to the statue from its rear.<br/>5. The WPA also carried out restoration work within the statue, temporarily removing the rays from the statue's halo so their rusted supports could be replaced.<br/>6. Rusted cast-iron steps in the pedestal were replaced with new ones made of reinforced concrete; the upper parts of the stairways within the statue were replaced, as well.<br/>7. Copper sheathing was installed to prevent further damage from rainwater that had been seeping into the pedestal.<br/>8. The statue was closed to the public from May until December 1938.During World War II, the statue remained open to visitors, although it was not illuminated at night due to wartime blackouts.<br/>9. It was lit briefly on December 31, 1943, and on D-Day, June 6, 1944, when its lights flashed ""dot-dot-dot-dash"", the Morse code for V, for victory.<br/>10. New, powerful lighting was installed in 1944–1945, and beginning on V-E Day, the statue was once again illuminated after sunset.<br/>11. The lighting was for only a few hours each evening, and it was not until 1957 that the statue was illuminated every night, all night.<br/>12. In 1946, the interior of the statue within reach of visitors was coated with a special plastic so that graffiti could be washed away.In 1956, an Act of Congress officially renamed Bedloe's Island as Liberty Island, a change advocated by Bartholdi generations earlier.<br/>13. The act also mentioned the efforts to found an American Museum of Immigration on the island, which backers took as federal approval of the project, though the government was slow to grant funds for it.<br/>14. Nearby Ellis Island was made part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument by proclamation of President Lyndon Johnson in 1965.<br/>15. In 1972, the immigration museum, in the statue's base, was finally opened in a ceremony led by President Richard Nixon.<br/>16. The museum's backers never provided it with an endowment to secure its future and it closed in 1991 after the opening of an immigration museum on Ellis Island.Beginning December 26, 1971, 15 anti-Vietnam war veterans occupied the statue, flying a US flag upside down from her crown.<br/>17. They left December 28 following a Federal Court order.<br/>18. The statue was also several times taken over briefly by demonstrators publicizing causes such as Puerto Rican independence, opposition to abortion, and opposition to US intervention in Grenada.<br/>19. Demonstrations with the permission of the Park Service included a Gay Pride Parade rally and the annual Captive Baltic Nations rally.A powerful new lighting system was installed in advance of the American Bicentennial in 1976.<br/>20. The statue was the focal point for Operation Sail, a regatta of tall ships from all over the world that entered New York Harbor on July 4, 1976, and sailed around Liberty Island.<br/>21. The day concluded with a spectacular display of fireworks near the statue.<br/>"
Forrest_Gump-Feather,"Category: Movies<br/>Title: Forrest Gump<br/>Section: Feather<br/><br/>1. Symbolism.Feather.Various interpretations have been suggested for the feather present at the opening and conclusion of the film.<br/>2. Sarah Lyall of ""The New York Times"" noted several opinions that were made about the feather: ""Does the white feather symbolize the unbearable lightness of being?<br/>3. Forrest Gump's impaired intellect?<br/>4. The randomness of experience?""<br/>5. Hanks interpreted the feather as: ""Our destiny is only defined by how we deal with the chance elements to our life and that's kind of the embodiment of the feather as it comes in.<br/>6. Here is this thing that can land anywhere and that it lands at your feet.<br/>7. It has theological implications that are really huge.""<br/>8. Sally Field compared the feather to fate, saying: ""It blows in the wind and just touches down here or there.<br/>9. Was it planned or was it just perchance?""<br/>10. Visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston compared the feather to an abstract painting: ""It can mean so many things to so many different people.<br/>11. ""The feather is stored in a book titled ""Curious George"", Forrest's favorite book, which his mother read to him, connecting the scene's present time with his childhood in the 1940s.<br/>12. The placement of the feather in the book is directly on a picture of the monkey walking on a tightrope.<br/>13. Whether that was intentional or not, it is very symbolic.<br/>14. The feather also has a correlation with Jenny's constant obsession with ""becoming a bird and flying far far away"" due to the abuse (sexual and physical) she endured from her father.<br/>15. She goes as far in the film as to ask Forrest ""if jumped off the bridge, could [she fly?""<br/>"

The Ancient Roman marriage ritual of ""confarreatio"" originated in the sharing of a cake.Particular types of cake may be associated with particular festivals, such as stollen or chocolate log (at Christmas), babka and simnel cake (at Easter), or mooncake.<br/>5. There has been a long tradition of decorating an iced cake at Christmas time; other cakes associated with Christmas include chocolate log and mince pies.<br/>"
Machu_Picchu-Layout,"Category: Travel<br/>Title: Machu Picchu<br/>Section: Layout<br/><br/>1. Site.Layout.The site is roughly divided into an urban sector and an agricultural sector, as well as the upper town and the lower town.<br/>2. The temples are part of the upper town, the warehouses the lower.The architecture is adapted to the natural form of the mountains.<br/>3. Approximately 200 buildings are arranged on wide parallel terraces around a vast central square that is oriented east-west.<br/>4. The various ""kanchas"" or compounds are long and narrow in order to exploit the terrain.<br/>5. Extensive terraces were used for agriculture and sophisticated channeling systems provided irrigation for the fields.<br/>6. Numerous stone stairways set in the walls allowed access to the different levels across the site.<br/>7. The eastern section of the city was probably residential.<br/>8. The western, separated by the square, was for religious and ceremonial purposes.<br/>9. This section contains the Torreón, the massive tower which may have been used as an observatory.Located in the first zone are the primary archaeological treasures: the ""Intihuatana"", the ""Temple of the Sun"" and the ""Room of the Three Windows"".<br/>10. These were dedicated to ""Inti"", their sun god and greatest deity.The Popular District, or Residential District, is the place where the lower-class people lived.<br/>11. It includes storage buildings and simple houses.The royalty area, a sector for the nobility, is a group of houses located in rows over a slope; the residence of the Amautas (wise persons) was characterized by its reddish walls, and the zone of the ""Ñustas"" (princesses) had trapezoid-shaped rooms.<br/>12. The Monumental Mausoleum is a carved statue with a vaulted interior and carved drawings.<br/>13. It was used for rites or sacrifices.The Guardhouse is a three-sided building, with one of its long sides opening onto the Terrace of the Ceremonial Rock.<br/>14. The three-sided style of Inca architecture is known as the ""wayrona"" style.<br/>"
Hey_Jude-Critical_reception,"Category: Music<br/>Title: Hey Jude<br/>Section: Critical reception<br/><br/>1. Upon the release of the ""Hey Jude"" single, ""Time"" contrasted it with its B-side ""Revolution.""<br/>2. ""Time"" wrote, ""The other side of the new disk urges activism of a different sort"" due to McCartney ""liltingly exhorta friend to overcome his fears and commit himself in love.""<br/>3. Robert Christgau of ""The Village Voice"" called it ""one of his truest and most forthright love songs"" and was critical of its omission from ""The Beatles"".<br/>4. Music analyst Alan Pollack praised ""Hey Jude,"" saying, ""it's such a good illustration of two compositional lessons—how to fill a large canvas with simple means, and how to use diverse elements such as harmony, bassline, and orchestration to articulate form and contrast.""<br/>5. He also said it is unusual for a long song because it uses a ""binary form that combines a fully developed, hymn-like song together with an extended, mantra-like jam on a simple chord progression.""<br/>6. Pollack described the song's long coda and fadeout as ""an astonishingly transcendental effect,"" while Unterberger observed, ""What could have very easily been boring is instead hypnotic"".<br/>7. John Lennon said ""Hey Jude"" was ""one of his [Paul's masterpieces.<br/>8. """"Hey Jude"" was nominated for the Grammy Awards of 1969 in the Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal categories but failed to win any of them.<br/>9. It did win the 1968 Ivor Novello Award for ""A-Side With the Highest Sales"".<br/>10. In the 1968 ""NME"" Readers' Poll, ""Hey Jude"" was named the best single of the year.<br/>11. In 2001, ""Hey Jude"" was inducted into the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Grammy Hall of Fame.In 2004 and later in 2010, ""Rolling Stone"" ranked the song at number eight on ""The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time,"" making it the highest ranked Beatles song on the list.<br/>12. Also in 2010, ""Rolling Stone"" ranked the song at number seven on the Beatles' 100 Greatest Songs.<br/>13. It came in third on Channel 4's list of 100 Greatest Singles.<br/>14. The Amusement & Music Operators Association ranked ""Hey Jude"" the 11th-best jukebox single of all time.<br/>15. It was also voted the greatest song of all time by ""Mojo"" readers.<br/>"
The_Terminator-Post-production,"Category: Movies<br/>Title: The Terminator<br/>Section: Post-production<br/><br/>1. After production finished on ""The Terminator"", some post-production shots were needed.<br/>2. These included scenes showing the Terminator outside Sarah Connor's apartment, Reese being zipped into a body bag, and the Terminator's head being crushed in a press.<br/>3. The film's soundtrack was synthesizer music composed by Brad Fiedel.<br/>4. Fiedel described the film's music as being about ""a mechanical man and his heartbeat"".<br/>5. Almost all the music in the film was performed live.<br/>6. ""The Terminator""s theme is played over the opening credits and is played in various points in the film in sped up versions: a slowed down version when Reese dies, and a piano version during the love scene.<br/>7. Fiedel created music for when Reese and Connor escape from the police station that would be appropriate for a ""heroic moment"".<br/>8. Cameron turned down this theme, as he believed it would lose the audience's excitement.<br/>9. The soundtrack to the film was released in 1984.<br/>"
Wright_Brothers_flights_of_1909-The_flights,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Wright Brothers flights of 1909<br/>Section: The flights<br/><br/>1. Another acclaimed aviator, Glenn Curtiss, had agreed to participate.<br/>2. Curtiss had recently set the world flight speed record in France, and the Wrights had just filed suit against him for patent infringement of their control systems.<br/>3. The public's anticipation was fueled by news of the patent disputes.<br/>4. These flights would be a showdown between the two fliers.<br/>5. They were both scheduled to make a series of flights from Governors Island in New York harbor.<br/>6. On September 29, Wilbur took off at 9:15 AM in windy conditions.<br/>7. Curtiss felt his airplane could not handle the winds and he declined to fly.<br/>8. When Curtiss admitted defeat to the wind, Wilbur is supposed to have said to him, 'It looks pretty good.<br/>9. I think I will take a little spin in a few minutes.'<br/>10. He flew for about two miles, which took a little longer than seven minutes.Later that day Wilbur took off again, at 10:18 AM.<br/>11. He flew over the ocean-liner RMS Lusitania and a flotilla of other watercraft on hand for the Hudson-Fulton celebration, many blowing their horns and tooting their whistles when the Flyer appeared overhead.<br/>12. As Wilbur flew toward the Statue of Liberty, many onlookers feared he would crash into it, but he skillfully circled the statue as planned.<br/>13. This flight caused a sensation in the press and became an iconic event, despite lasting less than five minutes.Still unable to fly in the gusty weather, Curtiss had to depart for St. Louis due to a prior agreement.<br/>14. He was supposed to have flown up the Hudson River for several miles and returned to Governors Island.On Monday, October 4, Wilbur took off at 9:53 AM.<br/>15. He flew north over the Hudson along the west shore of Manhattan, passing Grant's Tomb, then returned by the same route, finishing the 21 mile, 33-minute flight with a safe landing on Governor's Island.<br/>16. As many as a million people witnessed the flight.<br/>17. This was the exact flight that Curtiss had been unable to make.<br/>18. Before the flight, Wilbur attached a red canoe to the bottom of the airplane as a safety precaution in case of an emergency landing in the water.<br/>19. He reasoned that he could use the canoe to float himself to safety.<br/>20. A blown engine cylinder that afternoon prevented any more flights.<br/>21. This series of flights marked Wilbur's last flying before a public audience.<br/>22. After Wilbur's death in 1912, Orville put the canoe in Hawthorn Hill, his estate in Oakwood, Ohio, as a memento.<br/>23. This first airborne canoe was later moved to Carillon Historical Park in Ohio and exhibited in a room adjacent to the Wright Flyer III in Wright Hall.The flight around the Statue of Liberty was duplicated on May 26, 2003 by the Dayton 'Wright B Flyer, Inc.' group, with a replica of the Wright airplane as a part of the celebrations of the anniversary of the Wright brothers' first flight.<br/>"

Mount_Rushmore-Ecology,"Category: Travel<br/>Title: Mount Rushmore<br/>Section: Ecology<br/><br/>1. The flora and fauna of Mount Rushmore are similar to those of the rest of the Black Hills region of South Dakota.<br/>2. Birds including the turkey vulture, bald eagle, hawk, and meadowlark fly around Mount Rushmore, occasionally making nesting spots in the ledges of the mountain.<br/>3. Smaller birds, including songbirds, nuthatches, and woodpeckers, inhabit the surrounding pine forests.<br/>4. Terrestrial mammals include the mouse, least chipmunk, red squirrel, skunk, porcupine, raccoon, beaver, badger, coyote, bighorn sheep, bobcat, elk, mule deer, yellow-bellied marmot, and American bison.<br/>5. The striped chorus frog, western chorus frog, and northern leopard frog also inhabit the area.<br/>6. In addition, several species of snakes inhabit the region.<br/>7. Grizzly Bear Brook and Starling Basin Brook, the two streams in the memorial, support fish such as the longnose dace and the brook trout.<br/>8. Mountain goats are not indigenous to the area but can also be found here.<br/>9. They are descended from goats which were a gift from Canada to Custer State Park in 1924 but later escaped.At lower elevations, coniferous trees, mainly the Ponderosa pine, surround most of the monument, providing shade from the sun.<br/>10. Other trees include the bur oak, the Black Hills spruce, and the cottonwood.<br/>11. Nine species of shrubs grow near Mount Rushmore.<br/>12. There is also a wide variety of wildflowers, including especially the snapdragon, sunflower, and violet.<br/>13. Towards higher elevations, plant life becomes sparser.<br/>14. However, only approximately five percent of the plant species found in the Black Hills are indigenous to the region.The area receives about of precipitation on average per year, enough to support abundant animal and plant life.<br/>15. Trees and other plants help to control surface runoff.<br/>16. Dikes, seeps, and springs help to dam up water that is flowing downhill, providing watering spots for animals.<br/>17. In addition, stones like sandstone and limestone help to hold groundwater, creating aquifers.Through the study of tree rings, it has been determined that forest fires have occurred in the Ponderosa forests surrounding Mount Rushmore around every 27 years based on evidence of fire scars found within tree core samples.<br/>18. Large conflagrations are not common.<br/>19. Most events have been ground fires that serve to clear forest debris.<br/>20. The area is a climax community.<br/>21. Recent pine beetle infestations have threatened the forest.<br/>"
Donatello-Major_commissions_in_Florence,"Category: Art<br/>Title: Donatello<br/>Section: Major commissions in Florence<br/><br/>1. Around 1430, Cosimo de' Medici, the foremost art patron of his era, commissioned from Donatello the bronze David (now in the Bargello) for the court of his Palazzo Medici.<br/>2. This is now Donatello's most famous work.<br/>3. At the time of its creation, it was the first known free-standing nude statue produced since ancient times.<br/>4. Conceived fully in the round, independent of any architectural surroundings, and largely representing an allegory of the civic virtues triumphing over brutality and irrationality, it was the first major work of Renaissance sculpture.<br/>5. Also from this period is the disquietingly small ""Love-Atys"", housed in the Bargello.Some have perceived the David as having homo-erotic qualities, and have argued that this reflected the artist's own orientation.<br/>6. Details of Donatello's relationships remain speculative.<br/>7. The historian Paul Strathern makes the claim that Donatello made no secret of his homosexuality, and that his behaviour was tolerated by his friends.<br/>8. This may not be surprising in the context of attitudes prevailing in the 15th- and 16th-century Florentine republic.<br/>9. However, little detail is known with certainty about his private life, and no mention of his sexuality has been found in the Florentine archives (in terms of denunciations) albeit which during this period are incomplete.<br/>10. The main evidence comes from anecdotes by Angelo Poliziano in his """"Detti piacevoli"""".When Cosimo was exiled from Florence, Donatello went to Rome, remaining until 1433.<br/>11. The two works that testify to his presence in this city, the ""Tomb of Giovanni Crivelli"" at Santa Maria ""in Aracoeli"", and the ""Ciborium"" at St. Peter's Basilica, bear a strong stamp of classical influence.Donatello's return to Florence almost coincided with Cosimo's.<br/>12. In May 1434, he signed a contract for the marble pulpit on the facade of Prato cathedral, the last project executed in collaboration with Michelozzo.<br/>13. This work, a passionate, pagan, rhythmically-conceived bacchanalian dance of half-nude putti, was the forerunner of the great ""Cantoria"", or singing tribune, at the Duomo in Florence on which Donatello worked intermittently from 1433 to 1440 and was inspired by ancient sarcophagi and Byzantine ivory chests.<br/>14. In 1435, he executed the ""Annunciation"" for the Cavalcanti altar in Santa Croce, inspired by 14th-century iconography, and in 1437–1443, he worked in the Old Sacristy of the San Lorenzo in Florence, on two doors and lunettes portraying saints, as well as eight stucco tondoes.<br/>15. From 1438 is the wooden statue of St. John the Evangelist for Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari in Venice.<br/>16. Around 1440, he executed a bust of a ""Young Man with a Cameo"" now in the Bargello, the first example of a lay bust portrait since the classical era.<br/>"
Indonesia-Biota_and_environment,"Category: Country<br/>Title: Indonesia<br/>Section: Biota and environment<br/><br/>1. Indonesia's size, tropical climate, and archipelagic geography, support the world's second highest level of biodiversity (after Brazil), and its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species.<br/>2. The islands of the Sunda Shelf (Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Bali) were once linked to the Asian mainland, and have a wealth of Asian fauna.<br/>3. Large species such as the tiger, rhinoceros, orangutan, elephant, and leopard, were once abundant as far east as Bali, but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically.<br/>4. Forests cover approximately 60% of the country.<br/>5. In Sumatra and Kalimantan, these are predominantly of Asian species.<br/>6. However, the forests of the smaller, and more densely populated Java, have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture.<br/>7. Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, and Maluku – having been long separated from the continental landmasses—have developed their own unique flora and fauna.<br/>8. Papua was part of the Australian landmass, and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia, including over 600 bird species.Indonesia is second only to Australia in terms of total endemic species, with 36% of its 1,531 species of bird and 39% of its 515 species of mammal being endemic.Indonesia's of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country's high level of biodiversity.<br/>9. Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems, including beaches, sand dunes, estuaries, mangroves, coral reefs, sea grass beds, coastal mudflats, tidal flats, algal beds, and small island ecosystems.<br/>10. Indonesia is one of Coral Triangle countries with the world's greatest diversity of coral reef fish with more than 1,650 species in eastern Indonesia only.<br/>11. The British naturalist, Alfred Wallace, described a dividing line between the distribution and peace of Indonesia's Asian and Australasian species.<br/>12. Known as the Wallace Line, it runs roughly north-south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf, between Kalimantan and Sulawesi, and along the deep Lombok Strait, between Lombok and Bali.<br/>13. West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian; moving east from Lombok, they are increasingly Australian.<br/>14. In his 1869 book, ""The Malay Archipelago"", Wallace described numerous species unique to the area.<br/>15. The region of islands between his line and New Guinea is now termed Wallacea.Indonesia's high population and rapid industrialization present serious environmental issues, which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak, under-resourced governance.<br/>16. Issues include large-scale deforestation (much of it illegal) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore; over-exploitation of marine resources; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization and economic development, including air pollution, traffic congestion, garbage management, and reliable water and waste water services.<br/>17. Deforestation and the destruction of peatlands make Indonesia the world's third largest emitter of greenhouse gases.<br/>18. Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species, including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) as threatened, and 15 identified as critically endangered, including Bali Starling, Sumatran Orangutan, and Javan Rhinoceros.<br/>19. Much of Indonesia's deforestation is caused by forest clearing for the palm oil Industry, which has cleared 18 million hectares of forest for palm oil expansion.<br/>20. Palm oil expansion requires land reallocation as well as changes to the local and natural ecosystems.<br/>21. Palm oil expansion can generate wealth for local communities if done right.<br/>22. If down wrong it can degrade ecosystems and cause social conflicts.<br/>"

The_Starry_Night-Interpretations,"Category: Art<br/>Title: The Starry Night<br/>Section: Interpretations<br/><br/>1. Perhaps no other painting in Western Art has enjoyed such a varying array of intriguing interpretations.<br/>2. Academic theories tend towards two schools: ""the literal"" and ""the literary.""<br/>3. The ""literal"" includes both ""he painted what he saw"" and the ""hallucinatory genius"" arguments (as an individual's hallucinations are indistinguishable from real life) while the ""literary"" suggest that inspiration blossomed from some written source; most often cited for van Gogh's ""Starry Night"" are The Bible, Walt Whitman and Victor Hugo.Legendary 20th century art historian Albert Boime is generally credited with the best ""literal"" theory by proving, in conjunction with three Astronomer colleagues at UCLA the position of the stars from van Gogh's window in the asylum at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence at 4 a.m. on June 19, 1889, the day van Gogh wrote his brother that he had completed the painting.<br/>4. In a 1985 lecture to the American Astronomical Society, Boime compared the positions of the moon and Venus that night and showed that they corresponded to the positions of the celestial objects in the painting.<br/>5. While Boime and his lead astronomer, Charles Whitney agreed the large star above the horizon is the Morning Star, they failed to agree on the arrangement of the other stars.<br/>6. Boime claimed they constituted the constellation of Aries, while Whitney argued it was Cygnus.<br/>7. Boime further attempted to make the argument that van Gogh had likely seen an image of a spiral galaxy from Camille Flammarion's ""Astronomie populaire"", in an attempt to explain the existence of van Gogh's celestial spiral jetty.<br/>8. In his 800-plus existing letters, however, van Gogh makes no mention of ever reading Flammarion.As to the leading ""literary"" theories: those about The Bible range from van Gogh painting a passage out of Genesis 37 describing a dream of Joseph to an apocalyptic depiction out of the twelfth book of Revelation to a ""sublimated Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane""; while those from Whitman attempt to correlate the painting's poetic vision within Song of Myself; and (what has been mistakenly attributed to Hugo's Les Miserables) as an inspired depiction of God as ""a lighthouse in eclipse.<br/>9. ""This bevy of interpretations has helped keep van Gogh's ""Starry Night"" firmly within the discussions and lively debates of both public and academic art history.<br/>"
Taco-Traditional_tacos,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Taco<br/>Section: Traditional tacos<br/><br/>1. There are many traditional varieties of tacos:<br/>2. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tacos de Asador (""spit"" or ""grill"" tacos) may be composed of any of the following: ""carne asada tacos""; tacos de tripita (""tripe tacos""), grilled until crisp; and, ""chorizo asado"" (traditional Spanish style sausage).<br/>3. Each type is served on two overlapped small tortillas and sometimes garnished with guacamole, salsa, onions, and cilantro.<br/>4. Also prepared on the grill is a sandwiched taco called ""mulita"" (""little mule"") made with meat served between two tortillas and garnished with Oaxaca style cheese.<br/>5. """"Mulita"""" is used to describe these types of sandwiched tacos in the Northern States of Mexico, while they are known as Gringa in the Mexican south and are prepared using wheat flour tortillas.<br/>6. Tacos may also be served with salsa.<br/>7. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tacos de Cabeza or head tacos, in which there is a flat punctured metal plate from which steam emerges to cook the head of the cow.<br/>8. These include: ""Cabeza"", a serving of the muscles of the head; ""Sesos"" (""brains""); ""Lengua"" (""tongue""); ""Cachete"" (""cheeks""); ""Trompa"" (""lips""); and, ""Ojo"" (""eye"").<br/>9. Tortillas for these tacos are warmed on the same steaming plate for a different consistency.<br/>10. These tacos are typically served in pairs, and also include salsa, onion and cilantro with occasional use of guacamole.<br/>11. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tacos de Cazo for which a metal bowl filled with lard is typically used as a deep-fryer.<br/>12. Meats for these types of tacos typically include: ""Tripa"" (""tripe"", usually from a pig instead of a cow); ""Suadero"" (tender beef cuts), ""Carnitas"" and ""Buche"" (Literally, """"crop"""", as in ""bird's crop""; here, it is fried pig's esophagus.<br/>13. )<br/>14. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tacos sudados (""sweaty tacos"") are made by filling soft tortillas with a spicy meat mixture, then placing them in a basket covered with cloth.<br/>15. The covering keeps the tacos warm and traps steam (""sweat"") which softens them.<br/>16. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tacos Al pastor/De Adobada (""shepherd style"") are made of thin pork steaks seasoned with adobo seasoning, then skewered and overlapped on one another on a vertical rotisserie cooked and flame-broiled as it spins.<br/>17. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tacos dorados (fried tacos, literally, ""golden tacos"") called ""flauta""s (""flute"", because of the shape), or taquitos, for which the tortillas are filled with pre-cooked shredded chicken, beef or ""barbacoa"", rolled into an elongated cylinder and deep-fried until crisp.<br/>18. They are sometimes cooked in a microwave oven or broiled.<br/>19. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tacos de pescado (""fish tacos"") originated in Baja California in Mexico, where they consist of grilled or fried fish, lettuce or cabbage, pico de gallo, and a sour cream or citrus/mayonnaise sauce, all placed on top of a corn or flour tortilla.<br/>20. In the United States, they were first popularized by the Rubio's fast-food chain, and remain most popular in California, Colorado, and Washington.<br/>21. In California, they are often found at street vendors, and a regional variation is to serve them with cabbage and coleslaw dressing on top.<br/>22. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tacos de camarones (""shrimp tacos"") also originated in Baja California in Mexico.<br/>23. Grilled or fried shrimp are used, usually with the same accompaniments as fish tacos: lettuce or cabbage, pico de gallo, avocado and a sour cream or citrus/mayonnaise sauce, all placed on top of a corn or flour tortilla.<br/><br/>24. As an accompaniment to tacos, many taco stands will serve whole or sliced red radishes, lime slices, salt, pickled or grilled chilis (hot peppers), and occasionally cucumber slices, or grilled cambray onions.</br>"

However, it is very similar to udon.<br/>16. •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also a dish called ""udon"" in Palau, because of the former Japanese administration.<br/>17. The broth is soy sauce–based like Japanese udon.<br/>18. However, as there were many immigrants from Okinawa, it uses less broth like Okinawa soba.<br/>19. Most notably, the noodle is that of spaghetti, as it is easier to acquire there.<br/>"
Niagara_Falls-American_side,"Category: Travel<br/>Title: Niagara Falls<br/>Section: American side<br/><br/>1. From the U.S. side, the American Falls can be viewed from walkways along Prospect Point Park, which also features the Prospect Point Park observation tower and a boat dock for the ""Maid of the Mist"".<br/>2. Goat Island offers more views of the falls and is accessible by foot and automobile traffic by bridge above the American Falls.<br/>3. From Goat Island, the Cave of the Winds is accessible by elevator and leads hikers to a point beneath Bridal Veil Falls.<br/>4. Also on Goat Island are the Three Sisters Islands, the Power Portal where a huge statue of Nikola Tesla (the inventor whose patents for the AC induction motor and other devices for AC power transmission helped make the harnessing of the falls possible) can be seen, and a walking path that enables views of the rapids, the Niagara River, the gorge, and all of the falls.<br/>5. Most of these attractions lie within the Niagara Falls State Park.The Niagara Scenic Trolley offers guided trips along the American Falls and around Goat Island.<br/>6. Panoramic and aerial views of the falls can also be viewed from the Flight of Angels helium balloon ride, or by helicopter.<br/>7. The Niagara Gorge Discovery Center showcases the natural and local history of Niagara Falls and the Niagara Gorge.<br/>8. A casino and luxury hotel was opened in Niagara Falls, New York, by the Seneca Indian tribe.<br/>9. The Seneca Niagara Casino occupies the former Niagara Falls Convention Center.<br/>10.

Taekwondo-World_Taekwondo_Federation,"Category: Sport<br/>Title: Taekwondo<br/>Section: World Taekwondo Federation<br/><br/>1. Under World Taekwondo Federation and Olympic rules, sparring is a full-contact event and takes place between two competitors in an area measuring 8 meters square.<br/>2. A win can occur by points, or if one competitor is unable to continue (knockout) the other competitor wins.<br/>3. Each match consists of three semi-continuous rounds of contact, with one minute's rest between rounds.<br/>4. There are two age categories: 14–17 years and 18 years and older.<br/>5. Depending on the type of tournament and club, competitors may also wear fist protectors, foot protectors, instep guards, helmets, or mouth guards.Points are awarded for permitted, accurate, and powerful techniques delivered to the legal scoring areas; light contact does not score any points.<br/>6. The only techniques allowed are kicks (delivering a strike using an area of the foot below the ankle) and punches (delivering a strike using the closed fist).<br/>7. In most competitions, points are awarded by three corner judges using electronic scoring tallies.<br/>8. Several A-Class tournaments, however, are now experimenting with electronic scoring equipment contained within the competitors' body protectors.<br/>9. This limits corner judges to scoring only attacks to the head.<br/>10. Some believe that the new electronic scoring system will help to reduce controversy concerning judging decisions, but this technology is still not universally accepted.Beginning in 2009, a kick or punch that makes contact with the opponent's ""hogu"" (the body guard that functions as a scoring target) scores one point.<br/>11. If a kick to the ""hogu"" involves a technique that includes fully turning the attacking competitor's body, so that the back is fully exposed to the targeted competitor during execution of the technique (spinning kick), an additional point is awarded.<br/>12. A kick to the head scores three points; as of October 2010 an additional point is awarded if a turning kick was used to execute this attack.<br/>13. Punches to the head are not allowed.<br/>14. As of March 2010, no additional points are awarded for knocking down an opponent (beyond the normal points awarded for legal strikes).The referee can give penalties at any time for rule-breaking, such as hitting an area not recognized as a target, usually the legs or neck.<br/>15. Penalties are divided into ""Kyong-go"" (warning penalty) and ""Gam-jeom"" (deduction penalty).<br/>16. Two ""Kyong-go"" are counted as an addition of one point for the opposing contestant.<br/>17. However, the final odd-numbered ""Kyong-go"" is not counted in the grand total.At the end of three rounds, the competitor with most points wins the match.<br/>18. In the event of a tie, a fourth ""sudden death"" overtime round, sometimes called a ""Golden Point"", is held to determine the winner after a one-minute rest period.<br/>19. In this round, the first competitor to score a point wins the match.<br/>20. If there is no score in the additional round, the winner is decided by superiority, as determined by the refereeing officials.Until 2008, if one competitor gained a 7 point lead over the other, or if one competitor reached a total of 12 points, then that competitor was immediately declared the winner and the match ended.<br/>21. These rules were abolished by the WTF at the start of 2009.<br/>22. In October 2010 the WTF reintroduced a point-gap rule, stating that if a competitor has a 12-point lead at the end of the second round or achieves a 12-point lead at any point in the third round, then the match is over and that competitor is declared the winner.<br/>"
The_Scream-Thefts,"Category: Art<br/>Title: The Scream<br/>Section: Thefts<br/><br/>1. <br/>2. ""The Scream"" has been the target of a number of thefts and theft attempts.<br/>3. Some damage has been suffered in these thefts.<br/>4. On 12 February 1994, the same day as the opening of the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, two men broke into the National Gallery, Oslo, and stole its version of ""The Scream"", leaving a note reading ""Thanks for the poor security"".<br/>5. The painting had been moved down to a second-story gallery as part of the Olympic festivities.<br/>6. After the gallery refused to pay a ransom demand of US$1 million in March 1994, Norwegian police set up a sting operation with assistance from the British police (SO10) and the Getty Museum and the painting was recovered undamaged on 7 May 1994.<br/>7. In January 1996, four men were convicted in connection with the theft, including Pål Enger, who had been convicted of stealing Munch's ""Vampire"" in 1988.<br/>8. They were released on appeal on legal grounds: the British agents involved in the sting operation had entered Norway under false identities.The 1910 tempera on board version of ""The Scream"" was stolen on 22 August 2004, during daylight hours, when masked gunmen entered the Munch Museum in Oslo and stole it and Munch's ""Madonna"".<br/>9. A bystander photographed the robbers as they escaped to their car with the artwork.<br/>10. On 8 April 2005, Norwegian police arrested a suspect in connection with the theft, but the paintings remained missing and it was rumored that they had been burned by the thieves to destroy evidence.<br/>11. On 1 June 2005, with four suspects already in custody in connection with the crime, the city government of Oslo offered a reward of 2 million Norwegian krone (roughly US$313,500 or €231,200) for information that could help locate the paintings.<br/>12. Although the paintings remained missing, six men went on trial in early 2006, variously charged with either helping to plan or participating in the robbery.<br/>13. Three of the men were convicted and sentenced to between four and eight years in prison in May 2006, and two of the convicted, Bjørn Hoen and Petter Tharaldsen, were also ordered to pay compensation of 750 million kroner (roughly US$117.6 million or €86.7 million) to the City of Oslo.<br/>14. The Munch Museum was closed for ten months for a security overhaul.On 31 August 2006, Norwegian police announced that a police operation had recovered both ""The Scream"" and ""Madonna"", but did not reveal detailed circumstances of the recovery.<br/>15. The paintings were said to be in a better-than-expected condition.<br/>16. ""We are 100 percent certain they are the originals,"" police chief Iver Stensrud told a news conference.<br/>17. ""The damage was much less than feared.""<br/>18. Munch Museum director Ingebjørg Ydstie confirmed the condition of the paintings, saying it was much better than expected and that the damage could be repaired.<br/>19. ""The Scream"" had moisture damage on the lower left corner, while ""Madonna"" suffered several tears on the right side of the painting as well as two holes in Madonna's arm.<br/>20. Before repairs and restoration began, the paintings were put on public display by the Munch Museum beginning 27 September 2006.<br/>21. During the five-day exhibition, 5,500 people viewed the damaged paintings.<br/>22. The conserved works went back on display on 23 May 2008, when the exhibition ""Scream and Madonna — Revisited"" at the Munch Museum in Oslo displayed the paintings together.<br/>23. Some damage to ""The Scream"" may prove impossible to repair, but the overall integrity of the work has not been compromised.<br/>"
Steak-Skirt_steak,"Category: Food<br/>Title: Steak<br/>Section: Skirt steak<br/><br/>1. A skirt steak is a part of the plate (situated at the cow's abdomen), the steak is long, thick and tender and it is usually priced by its flavour rather than the tenderness because its flavour is better than its tenderness.<br/>2. Skirt steaks are not to be confused with flank steaks because they are near the sirloin and shank.<br/>3. Skirt steaks are used in many international cuisines: Mexican cuisine use this steak for fajitas and arrachera.<br/>4. In the United Kingdom it is often used as filling for Cornish pasties as well as vegetables such as carrot and potato.<br/>5. In Chinese cuisine it is used for stir-fries, in Spanish cuisine the steak is made for churrasco and Italian cuisine use skirt steak for making bolognese sauce as well as with tomatoes.<br/>"
Assassination_of_Abraham_Lincoln-Day_of_the_assassination,"Category: Historical Events<br/>Title: Assassination of Abraham Lincoln<br/>Section: Day of the assassination<br/><br/>1. Lincoln's day started well for the first time in a while.<br/>2. Hugh McCulloch, the new Secretary of the Treasury, remarked that on that morning, ""I never saw Mr. Lincoln so cheerful and happy"".<br/>3. No one could miss the difference.<br/>4. For months, the President had looked pale and haggard.<br/>5. Lincoln himself told people how happy he was.<br/>6. This caused First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln some concern, as she believed that saying such things out loud was bad luck.<br/>7. Lincoln paid her no heed.At around noon, while visiting Ford's Theatre to pick up his mail (Booth had a permanent mailbox there), Booth learned from the brother of John Ford, the owner, that the President and General Grant would be attending the theatre to see ""Our American Cousin"" that night.<br/>8. Booth determined that this was the perfect opportunity for him to do something ""decisive"".<br/>9. He knew the theater's layout, having performed there several times, as recently as the previous month.That same afternoon, Booth went to Mary Surratt's boarding house in Washington, D.C. and asked her to deliver a package to her tavern in Surrattsville, Maryland.<br/>10. He also requested Surratt to tell her tenant who resided there to have the guns and ammunition that Booth had previously stored at the tavern ready to be picked up later that evening.<br/>11. She complied with Booth's requests and made the trip, along with Louis J. Weichmann, her boarder and son's friend.<br/>12. This exchange, and her compliance in it, would lead directly to Surratt's execution three months later.At seven o'clock that evening, John Wilkes Booth met for a final time with all his fellow conspirators.<br/>13. Booth assigned Lewis Powell to kill Secretary of State William H. Seward at his home, George Atzerodt to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson at his residence, the Kirkwood Hotel, and David E. Herold to guide Powell to the Seward house and then out of Washington to rendezvous with Booth in Maryland.<br/>14. Booth planned to shoot Lincoln with his single-shot Derringer and then stab Grant with a knife at Ford's Theatre.<br/>15. They were all to strike simultaneously shortly after ten o'clock that night.<br/>16. Atzerodt wanted nothing to do with it, saying he had only signed up for a kidnapping, not a killing.<br/>17. Booth told him he was in too far to back out. <br/>"
