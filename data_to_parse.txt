How much money did "Gangnam Style" bring South Korea by 2012?
In 2012, the South Korean government announced that "Gangnam Style" had brought in $13.4 million to the country’s audio sector, and it subsequently launched a campaign to further expand the K-Pop music industry overseas.
According to the Bank of Korea, the country's services account recorded a surplus of USD 2.3 billion in the first nine months of this year, compared to a deficit of USD 4.5 billion last year.
This was mainly due to the growing influence and popularity of K-pop songs such as "Gangnam Style".
However, the American journalist John Seabrook noted that by "satirizing standard K-pop tropes in Gangnam Style", Psy may have subverted the music genre's chances of making it big in the West.
Did Harrison walk out and quit on the group?
The rehearsals and recording sessions for the album did not run smoothly.
The acrimony that began during the recording of the previous year's "White Album" resumed soon after the rehearsals began.
The Beatles were not getting along, and Lennon and McCartney weren't working together as before.
McCartney assumed the role of the leader, while a laid back Lennon was more interested in spending time/making music with his soon-to-be wife Yoko Ono, who was now present in the studio with him at all times.
All of the factors led to friction within the band.
At one point, Harrison walked out and quit the group after several arguments with McCartney and a severe fall-out with Lennon, due to the former's perfectionism and the latter's growing lack of interest in the band.
Harrison was eventually coaxed back a few days later.
The film version is famous for showcasing a number of conflicts between the group members and has frequently been referred to as a documentary intended to show the making of an album but instead showing "the break-up of a band".
Who sings the opening vocals on "Hey Jude?"
"Hey Jude" begins with McCartney singing lead vocals and playing the piano.
The patterns McCartney plays are based on three chords: F, C, and B-flat (I, V and IV); the second verse adds accompaniment by guitar and a single tambourine.
The main chord progression is "flipped on its head" for the coda since the C chord is replaced by E-flat.
Author Tim Riley notes, "As Ringo offers a restrained tom-tom and cymbal fill, the piano shifts downward to add a flat seventh to the tonic chord, making the downbeat of the bridge the point of arrival ('And any time you feel the "pain"')."
At the end of each bridge, McCartney sings a brief phrase ("Na-na-na na ...") and plays a piano fill which leads to the next verse; the phrase McCartney sings serves to "reorient the harmony for the verse as the piano figure turns upside down into a vocal aside."
Additional details, such as tambourine on the third verse and subtle harmonies that accompany the lead vocal, are added to sustain the interest of the listener throughout the four-verse, two-bridge song.The verse-bridge structure of the song persists for approximately three minutes, after which the band leads into a four-minute-long coda.
During the coda, the rest of the band, backed by an orchestra that also provides backing vocals, repeats the phrase "Na-na-na na" followed by the words "hey Jude" until the song gradually fades out.
"Time" magazine described the coda as "a fadeout that engagingly spoofs the fadeout as a gimmick for ending pop records."
Riley notes the repeated chord progression of the coda (I-VII-IV-I) "answers all the musical questions raised at the beginnings and ends of bridges," for "The flat seventh that pose dominant turns into bridges now has an entire chord built on it."
This three-chord refrain allows McCartney "a bedding ... to leap about on vocally", so he ad-libs his vocal performance for the rest of the song.
Riley concludes that the song "becomes a tour of Paul's vocal range: from the graceful inviting tones of the opening verse, through the mounting excitement of the song itself, to the surging raves of the coda."
In what chord does the opening melody of "ill tell you"
The song is in the key of G and opens on "I'll tell you" with a D-B, B-D melody note drop and rise over a I (G) chord.
Controversy exists over the landmark chord that Lennon stated McCartney hit on the piano while they were composing the song.
Marshall considers it is the minor vi (Em) chord (the third chord in the I-V7-vi (G-D7-Em) progression).
Everett is of the same opinion.
Pedler claims, however, that more surprising is the melody note drop from B to F# against a III7 (B7) chord on "understand".
Music theorists are divided over whether this chord is a iii (Bm), a B major, or a B7 or even a B5 power chord with no major or minor defining third.
What does Sting insists that the song is all about?
The lyrics are the words of a sinister, controlling character, who is watching "every breath you take; every move you make".Sting later said he was disconcerted by how many people think the song is more positive than it is.
He insists it's about the obsession with a lost lover, and the jealousy and surveillance that follow.
"One couple told me 'Oh we love that song; it was the main song played at our wedding!'
I thought, 'Well, good luck.'"
When asked why he appears angry in the music video Sting told BBC Radio 2, "I think the song is very, very sinister and ugly and people have actually misinterpreted it as being a gentle little love song, when it's quite the opposite.
"According to the "Back to Mono" box-set book, "Every Breath You Take" is influenced by a Gene Pitney song titled "Every Breath I Take".
The song's structure is a variation on the Classical rondo form with its AABACABA structure, a form rarely found in modern popular music.The demo of the song was recorded in an eight track suite in North London's Utopia studios and featured Sting singing over a Hammond organ.
While recording, Summers came up with a guitar part inspired by Béla Bartók that would later become a trademark lick, and played it straight through in one take.
He was asked to put guitar onto a simple backing track of bass, drums, and a single vocal, with Sting offering no directive beyond "make it your own.
"The recording process was fraught with difficulties as personal tensions between the band members, particularly Sting and Stewart Copeland, came to the fore.
Producer Hugh Padgham claimed that by the time of the recording sessions, Sting and Copeland "hated each other", with verbal and physical fights in the studio common.
The tensions almost led to the recording sessions being cancelled until a meeting involving the band and the group's manager, Miles Copeland (Stewart's brother), resulted in an agreement to continue.
The drum track was largely created through separate overdubs of each percussive instrument, with the main backbeat created by simultaneously playing a snare and a gong drum.
Keyboard parts were added from Roland guitar synthesisers, a Prophet-5 and an Oberheim synthesiser.
The single-note piano in the middle eight was recommended by Padgham, inspired by similar work that he had done with the group XTC.
Where does "Free Bird" rank on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time?
"Free Bird" is included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll, and at number 193 in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.
In 2009 it was named the 26th best hard rock song of all time by VH1.The song—half ballad, half up-tempo guitar solo—quickly became a staple for Lynyrd Skynyrd at their live performances.
Many recognize its 5:12 triple guitar solo section that closes it out.
It often turned into an extended jam session at concerts.
The band would consistently play it as the last song of every show, as it was their biggest crowd pleaser.
Overall the song proved to be a huge hit for Lynyrd Skynyrd and it remains a fan favorite to this day.
It is also a classic rock radio staple.Following the plane crash in 1977 in which several band members were killed, all of the songs played by surviving members were performed as instrumentals beginning with the Charlie Daniels Volunteer Jam V in 1979.
When "Free Bird" came up, a solitary microphone with a single spotlight would be at center stage while the band played the instrumental version.
This tradition lasted until 1989, when an almost-rioting audience coerced Rossington to urge Johnny Van Zant to sing the song for the first time – something he had vowed never to do on stage during the Tribute Tour.
The current version has a shortened solo similar to the original studio version.
Who sings She Will Be Loved?
"She Will Be Loved" is the third single on the American band Maroon 5's 2002 debut album, "Songs About Jane".
Released in 2004, the single peaked at #5 in the United States, and by December 2012 had sold more than 2,722,000 digital downloads.
It peaked at #4 in the United Kingdom.
In Australia, it reached #1, a position it held for 5 non-consecutive weeks.
The single is noted for its music video starring Kelly Preston.The song proved as successful as the band's previous hits, "This Love" and "Harder to Breathe", hitting number 1 on the Mainstream Top 40 and Adult Top 40 charts, but it prompted many alternative radio outlets to remove Maroon 5 from their playlists, on the ground that the band's newer songs were too light for alt-rock audiences.
These stations continued to play "Harder to Breathe" and "This Love", but Maroon 5's newer hits were played only on pop and adult contemporary stations.
What album is the soung "Counting Stars" from?
"Counting Stars" is a song by American pop rock band OneRepublic from their third studio album, "Native" (2013).
The song was written by lead singer Ryan Tedder, and produced by Tedder and Noel Zancanella.
Musically, it is a pop song with strong elements of folk music.
It was released as the album's third single on June 14, 2013 in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland.The song has been one of the band's most successful singles, reaching No.
1 in many countries including Canada and the United Kingdom, No.
2 in the United States, and top ten in 20 countries.The song's accompanying music video, directed by James Lees, features the band performing in a basement beneath an ongoing church congregation.
When was the album featuring the song How to save a life reeased?
The album was released on September 13, 2005 by Epic Records.
While the album did not make a splash commercially or critically initially, the success of "Over My Head (Cable Car)" propelled the album from the Top Heatseekers chart to the top 20 of The "Billboard" 200 chart.
The release of the second single, "How to Save a Life", a world-wide smash, helped the album enter the top 5 in several charts across the world, and brought The Fray mainstream popularity.
The song remains the band's best known and most successful song to date.
Wake Me Up When September Ends was peformed by what artist?
Like the majority of the videos from the album "American Idiot", it was directed by Samuel Bayer.
The video features Green Day's support guitarist, Jason White.
This is the second time Jason White has appeared in a Green Day video, first appearing in "When I Come Around", ten years earlier but not as a band member.The video focuses on a very loving couple (played by Jamie Bell and Evan Rachel Wood).
The boyfriend promises never to leave his girlfriend but they later argue when the boyfriend enlists in the United States Marine Corps.
The boyfriend interprets his actions as a way to show her that he loves her so much that he would put his life on the line to keep her safe; the girlfriend, however, is heartbroken, as he broke his vow to never leave her, and terrified at the thought that he might die in battle.
The video then shows the boyfriend in battle in Iraq being ambushed by insurgents.
This scene is intercut with scenes of the girlfriend tearfully mourning in a quiet field.
The video ends on this juxtaposition, emphasizing the pain and heartache of losing loved ones due to the war.This video adds to the "American Idiot" anti-war sentiment of the Iraq War.
The song eventually became a tribute song to the victims of Hurricane Katrina, and sound bites were added from various news coverages to the song.
A live version of the song, recorded on September 3, 2005, at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts was released soon after and dedicated to the hurricane's victims.
The song was performed live with U2 guitarist The Edge in the pregame show of the Monday Night Football game between the New Orleans Saints and the Atlanta Falcons; it was the first game played in the Superdome in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.
Which one of Snow Patrol's songs was featured on One Tree Hill?
Snow Patrol played "Chasing Cars" on an appearance on "Late Night with Conan O'Brien".
The song was also performed as the last live performance on long-running music programme "Top of the Pops".
The band also performed the song when they were the musical guest on the 17 March 2007 episode of "Saturday Night Live", hosted by Julia Louis-Dreyfus.
Additionally, the band played the song live in their appearance at Live Earth.
On 7 July 2007, this song was performed during the London leg of the Live Earth concert at Wembley Stadium and at Oxegen later on that night in Ireland.
"Chasing Cars" was heard on the TV show "One Tree Hill'"s third season finale episode "The Show Must Go On", which aired in the US on 3 May 2006.
Several weeks later, the song appeared on the second season finale of "Grey's Anatomy" on 15 May 2006, and the song found a larger listening audience and pushed its way onto the download and pop charts in the United States.
The song was made into a music video for the show, serving as a promotion for its third season.
The music video shows scenes from the first and second seasons as well as previously unseen scenes from the third season, with clips in-between from the UK music video of the song.
It was heard again in the eighteenth episode of the show's seventh season on 31 March 2011, along with the cast's cover of Brandi Carlile's "The Story" and The Fray's "How to Save a Life".
What song did the single "Last Christmas" lift it's melody from?
"Can't Smile Without You" is a song written by Christian Arnold, David Martin, and Geoff Morrow, best known in its rendition by Barry Manilow.
"Can't Smile Without You" was the first single to be released from Manilow's album "Even Now".
The song was released as a single in 1978 where it reached the number one spot on Billboard's AC chart, and the number three spot on the Billboard Hot 100.
Previously, the song was recorded by The Carpenters on their album "A Kind of Hush" in 1976, and was featured as the B-side of their hit "Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft" the following year.
Manilow's version had slightly different lyrics from the Carpenters, such as the Carpenters's line "I can't laugh and I can't walk / I'm finding it hard even to talk," was changed in Manilow's version to "I can't laugh and I can't sing / I'm finding it hard to do anything" (the latter is likely the original lyric, changed by the Carpenters because the lyric "I can't sing" when being sung makes no sense).
The Carpenters remixed the song for the B-side of "Calling Occupants" in September 1977, again revising the lyric to read "I can't laugh and I can't sleep / I don't even talk to people I meet".
Additional orchestration was also included in the remix.A version on Manilow's greatest hits box set, "The Complete Collection and Then Some..." combines the first half of Take 1 with the double-tracked second half of his released version.Engelbert Humperdinck released the song, using the same lyrics as the original Carpenters version, on his After the Lovin' album, 1976.On behalf of the songwriters, publishing company Dick James Music sued George Michael for plagiarism in the mid-'80s, claiming that the 1984 Wham!
single "Last Christmas" lifted its melody from "Can't Smile Without You."
The case was settled out of court.
In 2010 George Michael was publicly cleared of all charges.Jerry Lewis often sings the song on his annual Muscular Dystrophy Association telethon, with altered lyrics that speak of the need for the viewers to call in their pledge.The song has appeared in such films as "Four Weddings and a Funeral", ', "Unconditional Love", "Starsky & Hutch", ' and "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas".In 2008, there was an attempt by Tottenham Hotspur F.C.
supporters following their League Cup win to get the song to Number One, as they see this song as being a part of the club, with the words "Can't Smile Without You" being seen on many flags, banners, and websites as a slogan to the club.In 2010, GP Maxine Brooks released the song as a charity single for Nurse's Aid, supporting wounded soldiers and in memory of a WWI heroine.

Which british actor co-starred in a video with Eminem?
Music video.Production.The music video for "Love the Way You Lie" was Eminem's third to be directed by the American filmmaker Joseph Kahn.
Despite having planned to shoot a feature film and stop directing pop videos, Kahn chose to work on "Love the Way You Lie" because, according to him, the song discusses an important topic.
This was an opportunity for him to direct a video for Eminem without the comedic themes of their previous collaborations.
For the video, Kahn considered the British actor Dominic Monaghan as a co-star for his versatility, which he thought would help him play an antagonist.
Kahn cast the American actress Megan Fox, which he had presumed would be almost impossible because of her popularity with directors.
Fox, a fan of Eminem, accepted the role unhesitatingly.Rosenberg gave Kahn one day to write a treatment, which Kahn finished in forty-five minutes.
He filmed Eminem's and Rihanna's parts on July 20, 2010; scenes with Fox and Monaghan were shot three days later.
By July 24, 2010, they had finished the shoot.
Kahn confirmed the completion of the director's cut the next day.
He said Fox's involvement made the video powerful, commenting for "Vibe":We wanted to make a specific story about two people—Meg and Dom—not a video that was representative of all couples or all domestic violence situations.
I'm not saying that all couples fight this way.
I just want people just to be able to identify with the characters and recognize that they've seen relationships like this where two people are together that are completely wrong for each other and things spiral out of control.
... Megan was the key to this video.
...
I'll tell you as a director the reason why and Monaghan's scenes in the video feel so real is because in the moment they were real.Monaghan told MTV he thought the couple represents Eminem and Scott.
The clip was produced by Kathy Angstadt and Maryann Tanedo of HSI Productions.
Shortly before its release, Eminem reported in a press statement: "Joseph and I worked pretty closely together to make sure we got this right".
He said the difficult topic resulted in a powerful video because of the contributions of Rihanna, Fox and Monaghan.
Fox donated her appearance fee to the Soujourn House, a battered women's shelter.
On August 5, 2010, the video premiered on MTV and the music video website Vevo.
What year did Carey write "All I Want for Christmas Is You"?
After a string of commercially successful albums, Carey's label Columbia Records began exercising the idea of the singer releasing a Christmas album.
They felt that up until that point, Carey had been viewed as a pop singer.
With the record, Columbia intended to broaden Carey's target market, and have her perceived more as an entertainer, not just a singer.
Having been brought up as Christian and always celebrating Christmas, she agreed to create a holiday-themed album.
With Walter Afanasieff, Carey co-wrote "All I Want for Christmas Is You" while recording the album in mid-1994.
In an interview, Carey explained the inspiration behind the song:I'm a very festive person and I love the holidays.
I've sung Christmas songs since I was a little girl.
I used to go Christmas caroling.
When it came to the album, we had to have a nice balance between standard Christian hymns and fun songs.
It was definitely a priority for me to write at least a few new songs, but for the most part people really want to hear the standards at Christmas time, no matter how good a new song is.Ostensibly, the song was inspired by Carey's romantic sentiments toward her then-husband Tommy Mottola.
After the album's release, many promotional singles were released; while other songs were sent to Christian airplay radio stations, "All I Want for Christmas Is You" was sent to pop and Top 40 channels.
Author Chris Nickson described the song as "fun and mellow", and he felt its uptempo beat contrasted with the album's strong religious theme, broadening the album's appeal to teenage audiences.

In an effort to "stay cool by thinking cool", the most-performed (according to BMI) Christmas song was born.
"I saw a spiral pad on his (Wells') piano with four lines written in pencil", Tormé recalled.
"They started, 'Chestnuts roasting..., Jack Frost nipping..., Yuletide carols..., Folks dressed up like Eskimos.'
Bob didn't think he was writing a song lyric.
He said he thought if he could immerse himself in winter he could cool off.
Forty minutes later that song was written.

Notable exceptions were: "The Daleks' Master Plan", which aired in 12 episodes (plus an earlier one-episode teaser, "Mission to the Unknown", featuring none of the regular cast); almost an entire season of seven-episode serials (season 7); the 10-episode serial "The War Games"; and "The Trial of a Time Lord", which ran for 14 episodes (albeit divided into three production codes and four narrative segments) during season 23.
Occasionally serials were loosely connected by a storyline, such as season 8 being devoted to the Doctor battling a rogue Time Lord called The Master, season 16's quest for The Key to Time, season 18's journey through E-Space and the theme of entropy, and season 20's Black Guardian Trilogy.The programme was intended to be educational and for family viewing on the early Saturday evening schedule.
Initially, it alternated stories set in the past, which were intended to teach younger audience members about history, with stories set either in the future or in outer space to teach them about science.
This was also reflected in the Doctor's original companions, one of whom was a science teacher and another a history teacher.However, science fiction stories came to dominate the programme and the "historicals", which were not popular with the production team, were dropped after "The Highlanders" (1967).
While the show continued to use historical settings, they were generally used as a backdrop for science fiction tales, with one exception: "Black Orchid" set in 1920s England.The early stories were serial-like in nature, with the narrative of one story flowing into the next, and each episode having its own title, although produced as distinct stories with their own production codes.
Following "The Gunfighters" (1966), however, each serial was given its own title, with the individual parts simply being assigned episode numbers.Of the programme's many writers, Robert Holmes was the most prolific, while Douglas Adams became the most well-known outside "Doctor Who" itself, due to the popularity of his "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy".The serial format changed for the 2005 revival, with each series usually consisting of 13 45-minute, self-contained episodes (60 minutes with adverts, on overseas commercial channels), and an extended episode broadcast on Christmas Day.
Each series includes several standalone and multi-part stories, linked with a loose story arc that resolves in the series finale.
As in the early "classic" era, each episode, whether standalone or part of a larger story, has its own title.
Occasionally, regular-series episodes will exceed the 45-minute run time; notably, the episodes "Journey's End" from 2008 and "The Eleventh Hour" from 2010 exceeded an hour in length.800 "Doctor Who" instalments have been televised since 1963, ranging between 25-minute episodes (the most common format), 45-minute episodes (for "Resurrection of the Daleks" in the 1984 series, a single season in 1985, and the revival), two feature-length productions (1983's "The Five Doctors" and the 1996 television film), eight Christmas specials (most of 60 minutes' duration, one of 72 minutes), and four additional specials ranging from 60 to 75 minutes in 2009, 2010 and 2013.
Four mini-episodes, running about eight minutes each, were also produced for the 1993, 2005 and 2007 Children in Need charity appeals, while another mini-episode was produced in 2008 for a "Doctor Who"-themed edition of The Proms.
The 1993 2-part story, entitled "Dimensions in Time", was made in collaboration with the cast of the BBC soap-opera "EastEnders" and was filmed partly on the "EastEnders" set.
A two-part mini-episode was also produced for the 2011 edition of Comic Relief.
Starting with the 2009 special "Planet of the Dead", the series was filmed in 1080i for HDTV, and broadcast simultaneously on BBC One and BBC HD.To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the show, a special 3D episode, "The Day of the Doctor", was broadcast in 2013.
In March 2013, it was announced that Tennant and Piper would be returning, and that the episode would have a limited cinematic release worldwide.

How many historic buildings are located at the Antebellum Plantation and Farmyard museum?
Confederate Hall, operated directly by the Stone Mountain Memorial Association or SMMA, is a museum that educates students and park guests on the geology and ecology of Stone Mountain as well as historical aspects of the area.
A small theater shows a historical documentary about the Civil War in Georgia called "The Battle for Georgia".The education department is host to thousands of students each school year teaching the subjects of geology, ecology, and history.
Classes are designed to meet the Georgia Performance Standards and the North American Association for Environmental Education guidelines.The Antebellum Plantation and Farmyard is an open air museum composed of 19 historic buildings, built between 1790 and 1875, which have been re-erected to the site to represent a pre-Civil War Georgia plantation.
The historic houses have been furnished with an extensive collection of period furniture and decorations.
The farm features live animals that guests can pet.A 732-bell carillon that originated at the 1964 New York World's Fair, provides a daily concert.A covered bridge, dating from 1892, which originally spanned the Oconee River in Athens, Georgia.A grist mill, dating from 1869 and moved to the park in 1965.

What year did Giorgio Vasari write "Guglielmo" ?
 On January 5, 1172, Donna Berta di Bernardo, a widow and resident of the house of dell'Opera di Santa Maria, bequeathed sixty soldi to the "Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte Marie".
The sum was then used toward the purchase of a few stones which still form the base of the bell tower.
 On August 9, 1173, the foundations of the Tower were laid.
 Nearly four centuries later Giorgio Vasari wrote: "Guglielmo, according to what is being said, in year 1174 with Bonanno as sculptor, laid the foundations of the bell tower of the cathedral in Pisa.
"
 Giorgio Vasari indicates that Tommaso di Andrea Pisano was the designer of the belfry between 1360 and 1370.
 On December 27, 1233, the worker Benenato, son of Gerardo Bottici, oversaw the continuation of the construction of the bell tower.
 On February 23, 1260, Guido Speziale, son of Giovanni, a worker on the cathedral Santa Maria Maggiore, was elected to oversee the building of the Tower.
 On April 12, 1264, the master builder Giovanni di Simone and 23 workers went to the mountains close to Pisa to cut marble.
The cut stones were given to Rainaldo Speziale, worker of St. Francesco.

This is now open to the public, complete with period decorations and lifelike models of Gustave and some guests.
Who currently owns the La Casa Concha?
In 1912 and 1914–15, Bingham excavated treasures from Machu Picchu—ceramic vessels, silver statues, jewelry, and human bones—and took them from Peru to Yale University in the United States for further study, supposedly for a period of 18 months.
Yale has retained the artifacts until now, under the argument that Peru did not have the infrastructure or proper conditions to take care of the pieces.Eliane Karp, an anthropologist who is married to the former Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo, accused Yale of profiting from Peru's cultural heritage by claiming title to thousands of pieces removed by Bingham.
Many have been on display at Yale's Peabody Museum since their removal.
Yale returned some of the artifacts to Peru, but the university kept the remainder, claiming its position was supported by federal case law involving Peruvian antiquities.On 19 September 2007, the "Courant" reported that Peru and Yale had reached an agreement regarding the requested return of the artifacts.
The agreement includes sponsorship of a joint traveling exhibition and construction of a new museum and research center in Cusco about which Yale will advise Peruvian officials.
Yale acknowledges Peru's title to all the excavated objects from Machu Picchu, but Yale will share rights with Peru in the research collection, part of which will remain at Yale as an object of continuing study.On 19 June 2008, National Geographic Society's vice-president Terry Garcia was quoted by the daily publication, "La República".
"We were part of this agreement.
National Geographic was there, we know what was said, the objects were lent and should be returned.
"On 21 November 2010, Yale University agreed in principle to the return of the controversial artifacts to their original home in Peru.
As of November 2012, the third and final batch of thousands of artifacts were delivered.La Casa Concha (The Shell House) located close to Cusco's colonial center will be the permanent site where the Yale University artifacts will be exhibited.
Owned by the National University of San Antonio Abad Del Cusco, La Casa Concha will also feature a study area for local and foreign students.
In what year did Holidayland close at Disneyland Park?
Disneyland Park consists of eight themed "lands" and a number of concealed backstage areas, and occupies approximately .
The park opened with "Main Street, U.S.A.", "Adventureland", "Frontierland", "Fantasyland", and "Tomorrowland", and has since added New Orleans Square in 1966, Bear Country (later Critter Country) in 1972, and Mickey's Toontown in 1993.
In 1957, Holidayland, opened to the public with a recreation area including a circus and baseball diamond, but was closed in late 1961.
It is often referred to as the "lost" land of Disneyland.
Throughout the park are 'Hidden Mickeys', representations of Mickey Mouse heads inserted subtly into the design of attractions and environmental decor.
An elevated berm supports the narrow gauge Disneyland Railroad that circumnavigates the park.
Which year did Qin Shi Huang unify China?
History.Early walls.The Chinese were already familiar with the techniques of wall-building by the time of the Spring and Autumn period between the 8th and 5th centuries BC.
During this time and the subsequent Warring States period, the states of Qin, Wei, Zhao, Qi, Yan and Zhongshan all constructed extensive fortifications to defend their own borders.
Built to withstand the attack of small arms such as swords and spears, these walls were made mostly by stamping earth and gravel between board frames.Qin Shi Huang conquered all opposing states and unified China in 221 BC, establishing the Qin Dynasty.
Intending to impose centralized rule and prevent the resurgence of feudal lords, he ordered the destruction of the wall sections that divided his empire along the former state borders.
To position the empire against the Xiongnu people from the north, he ordered the building of new walls to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire's northern frontier.
Transporting the large quantity of materials required for construction was difficult, so builders always tried to use local resources.
Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges, while rammed earth was used for construction in the plains.
There are no surviving historical records indicating the exact length and course of the Qin Dynasty walls.
Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries, and very few sections remain today.The human cost of the construction is unknown, but it has been estimated by some authors that hundreds of thousands,if not up to a million, workers died building the Qin wall.
Later, the Han, Sui, and the Northern dynasties all repaired, rebuilt, or expanded sections of the Great Wall at great cost to defend themselves against northern invaders.
The Tang and Song Dynasties did not build any walls in the region substantially.
The Liao, Jin, and Yuan dynasties, who ruled Northern China throughout most of the 10th–13th centuries, constructed defensive walls in the 12th century, but those were located much to the north of the Great Wall as we know it, within today's Inner and Outer Mongolia.
In what year did Northern Rhodesia become an independent state?
In 1964, Northern Rhodesia became the independent state of Zambia.
The following year, Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence.
This was not recognized by Zambia, the United Kingdom or the vast majority of states and led to United Nations-mandated sanctions.
In response to the emerging crisis, in 1966 Zambia restricted or stopped border crossings; it did not re-open the border completely until 1980.
Guerilla warfare arose on the southern side of the Zambezi from 1972: the Rhodesian Bush War.
Visitor numbers began to drop, particularly on the Rhodesian side.
The war affected Zambia through military incursions, causing the latter to impose security measures including the stationing of soldiers to restrict access to the gorges and some parts of the falls.Zimbabwe's internationally recognised independence in 1980 brought comparative peace, and the 1980s witnessed renewed levels of tourism and the development of the region as a centre for adventure sports.
Activities that gained popularity in the area include whitewater rafting in the gorges, bungee jumping from the bridge, game fishing, horse riding, kayaking, and flights over the falls.
Where is the Heritage and Research Center located at?
The Heritage and Research Center is located at Gardiner, Montana, near the north entrance to the park.
The center is home to the Yellowstone National Park's museum collection, archives, research library, historian, archeology lab, and herbarium.
The Yellowstone National Park Archives maintain collections of historical records of Yellowstone and the National Park Service.
The collection includes the administrative records of Yellowstone, as well as resource management records, records from major projects, and donated manuscripts and personal papers.
The archives are affiliated with the National Archives and Records Administration.
What was a consequence of the streams running faster?
Starting 10 million years ago, vertical movement along the Sierra fault started to uplift the Sierra Nevada.
Subsequent tilting of the Sierra block and the resulting accelerated uplift of the Sierra Nevada increased the gradient of western-flowing streams.
The streams consequently ran faster and thus cut their valleys more quickly.
Additional uplift occurred when major faults developed to the east, especially the creation of Owens Valley from Basin and Range-associated extensional forces.
Uplift of the Sierra accelerated again about two million years ago during the Pleistocene.The uplifting and increased erosion exposed granitic rocks in the area to surface pressures, resulting in exfoliation (responsible for the rounded shape of the many domes in the park) and mass wasting following the numerous fracture joint planes (cracks; especially vertical ones) in the now solidified plutons.
Pleistocene glaciers further accelerated this process and the larger ones transported the resulting talus and till from valley floors.Numerous vertical joint planes controlled where and how fast erosion took place.
Most of these long, linear and very deep cracks trend northeast or northwest and form parallel, often regularly spaced sets.
They were created by uplift-associated pressure release and by the unloading of overlying rock via erosion.
Slopes facing which direction receive the full amount of sunlight in the Sonoran Desert?
Biology and ecology.Plants.There are approximately 1,737 known species of vascular plants, 167 species of fungi, 64 species of moss and 195 species of lichen found in Grand Canyon National Park.
This variety is largely due to the 8,000 foot elevation change from the Colorado River up to the highest point on the North Rim.
Grand Canyon boasts a dozen endemic plants (known only within the Park's boundaries) while only ten percent of the Park's flora is exotic.
Sixty-three plants found here have been given special status by the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service.The Mojave Desert influences the western sections of the canyon, Sonoran Desert vegetation covers the eastern sections, and ponderosa and pinyon pine forests grow on both rims.Natural seeps and springs percolating out of the canyon walls are home to 11% of all the plant species found in the Grand Canyon.
The Canyon itself can act as a connection between the east and the west by providing corridors of appropriate habitat along its length.
The canyon can also be a genetic barrier to some species, like the Tassel-eared squirrel.The aspect, or direction a slope faces, also plays a major role in adding diversity to the Grand Canyon.
North-facing slopes receive about one-third the normal amount of sunlight, so plants growing there are similar to plants found at higher elevations, or in more northern latitudes.
The south-facing slopes receive the full amount of sunlight and are covered in vegetation typical of the Sonoran Desert.
Where is Mount Rushmore located?
Mount Rushmore is largely composed of granite.
The memorial is carved on the northwest margin of the Harney Peak granite batholith in the Black Hills of South Dakota, so the geologic formations of the heart of the Black Hills region are also evident at Mount Rushmore.
The batholith magma intruded into the pre-existing mica schist rocks during the Proterozoic, roughly 1.6 billion years ago.
Coarse grained pegmatite dikes are associated with the granite intrusion of Harney Peak and are visibly lighter in color, thus explaining the light-colored streaks on the foreheads of the presidents.The Black Hills granites were exposed to erosion during the Neoproterozoic, but were later buried by sandstone and other sediments during the Cambrian.
Remaining buried throughout the Paleozoic, they were re-exposed again during the Laramide orogeny around 70 million years ago.
The Black Hills area was uplifted as an elongated geologic dome.
Subsequent erosion stripped the granite of the overlying sediments and the softer adjacent schist.
Some schist does remain and can be seen as the darker material just below the sculpture of Washington.The tallest mountain in the region is Harney Peak ().
Borglum selected Mount Rushmore as the site for several reasons.
The rock of the mountain is composed of smooth, fine-grained granite.
The durable granite erodes only every 10,000 years, thus was more than sturdy enough to support the sculpture and its long-term exposure.
The mountain's height of above sea level made it suitable, and because it faces the southeast, the workers also had the advantage of sunlight for most of the day.
Which professional Seattle sports team features the Space Need in their logo?
Being a major symbol of the Pacific Northwest, the Space Needle has made numerous appearances in films, TV shows and other works of fiction.
A few examples of films include "It Happened at the World's Fair" (1962), where it was used as a filming location, and "Sleepless in Seattle" (1993).
In the 1974 film "The Parallax View", the inside and outside platforms of the observation deck are the setting for a political assassination, and there's a brief chase on the roof above it.
In the 1999 film "", it served as a base of operations for the villain Doctor Evil with the word Starbucks written across its saucer after his henchman Number 2 shifted the organization's resources toward the coffee company.
It is also featured prominently in "Chronicle" (2012), and is a key element in the film's climax.In TV shows, one of the most prominent showings is in the series "Frasier" where an outline of it appears in the opening credits and the base of it is visible from the high-rise condo although the view is really a composite image as there are no high rise condos in the right area of that height.
It also appears in nearly every episode of the Seattle-set series "Grey's Anatomy", often in helicopter fly-by shots.
The Space Needle also makes appearances in Nickelodeon TV show "iCarly" where it can be seen with other surrounding buildings in the Seattle area.Other TV appearances include The History Channel's "Life After People" where it collapses after 200 years because of corrosion.
It was also destroyed in the TV miniseries "10.5" when a 7.9 earthquake hits Seattle.
The movie mistakenly portrays the Needle as crumbling concrete, though the structure is actually made of iron and it would have survived a 7.9 earthquake in real life.
The needle is also featured in some episodes of "Bill Nye the Science Guy", such as the episode "Storms" where Bill Nye uses the lightning rod on top of it as an example of conducting lightning strikes.
It also appears many times as a refuge for the hero of "Dark Angel".In video games, it has been used to represent Seattle in "Pilotwings 64" and "Rock Band" and it appears in the Seattle Circuit reverse of "Gran Turismo 4".
The Space Needle and the area around it also appear in the last campaign mission of "World in Conflict" as the site of the Soviet invasion force's last stand.
The Space Needle is in the map "Seattle" of Godzilla: Saves the Earth, for the original Xbox.
The Space Needle has been used for some other purposes as well, including a large 57 piece Lego construction set of it that has been released as part of Lego Architecture's structures.
The Needle is also featured on the logo of the Major League Soccer team Seattle Sounders FC.The Space Needle is featured in "."
Who designed the Statue of Liberty?
The Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World; French: "La Liberté éclairant le monde") is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in the middle of New York Harbor, in Manhattan, New York City.
The statue, designed by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and dedicated on October 28, 1886, was a gift to the United States from the people of France.
The statue is of a robed female figure representing Libertas, the Roman goddess of freedom, who bears a torch and a "tabula ansata" (a tablet evoking the law) upon which is inscribed the date of the American Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776.
A broken chain lies at her feet.
The statue is an icon of freedom and of the United States: a welcoming signal to immigrants arriving from abroad.Bartholdi was inspired by French law professor and politician Édouard René de Laboulaye, who is said to have commented in 1865 that any monument raised to American independence would properly be a joint project of the French and American peoples.
Due to the troubled political situation in France, work on the statue did not commence until the early 1870s.
In 1875, Laboulaye proposed that the French finance the statue and the Americans provide the site and build the pedestal.
Bartholdi completed the head and the torch-bearing arm before the statue was fully designed, and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions.The torch-bearing arm was displayed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, in 1876, and in New York's Madison Square Park from 1876 to 1882.
Fundraising proved difficult, especially for the Americans, and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened due to lack of funds.
Publisher Joseph Pulitzer of the "New York World" started a drive for donations to complete the project that attracted more than 120,000 contributors, most of whom gave less than a dollar.
The statue was constructed in France, shipped overseas in crates, and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called Bedloe's Island.
The statue's completion was marked by New York's first ticker-tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland.The statue was administered by the United States Lighthouse Board until 1901 and then by the Department of War; since 1933 it has been maintained by the National Park Service.
The statue was closed for renovation for much of 1938.
In the early 1980s, it was found to have deteriorated to such an extent that a major restoration was required.
While the statue was closed from 1984 to 1986, the torch and a large part of the internal structure were replaced.
After the September 11 attacks in 2001, it was closed for reasons of safety and security; the pedestal reopened in 2004 and the statue in 2009, with limits on the number of visitors allowed to ascend to the crown.
The statue, including the pedestal and base, was closed for a year until October 28, 2012, so that a secondary staircase and other safety features could be installed; Liberty Island remained open.
However, one day after the reopening, Liberty Island closed due to the effects of Hurricane Sandy; the statue and island opened again on July 4, 2013.
Public access to the balcony surrounding the torch has been barred for safety reasons since 1916.
How far back does the name "Geuaga Lake" date back to?
 Ohio sale, re-birth, and eventual transition.In February 2001, Anheuser-Busch sold the SeaWorld Ohio park to Six Flags, Inc., operators of neighboring "Six Flags Ohio" (Geauga Lake until the end of 1999, reverting to the "Geauga Lake" name in 2004).
Upon completion of the sale, the two parks were combined in spring 2001 as the so-called "mega-park" "Six Flags Worlds Of Adventure", which boasted its "Three parks in one" uniqueness: a waterpark, an amusement park, and a wildlife animal park - all included in one price of admission.
SeaWorld executives replied that their park had been sold because of the short season of the animal park, because of Northeastern Ohio's cold winter months, and also because they were not able to get the rights to build roller coasters like the other SeaWorld properties had been able to.In March 2004, Six Flags, Inc., announced that it had sold "Six Flags Worlds of Adventure" to Cedar Fair Entertainment Company, the operators of the Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio.
Cedar Fair took the park back to its original "Geauga Lake" name, which had a history dating back to 1888.
Since the Six Flags company retained ownership of the animals, the majority of the animal portion of the park, including all of the exhibits and animal stadiums, was either emptied or fenced off for the 2004 season.After a nearly season-long wait, the Cedar Fair company announced its plans for the non-operational side of the former SeaWorld Ohio/Six Flags Worlds of Adventure-Wildlife Side.
That entire portion of the land would become an immense waterpark, named "Wildwater Kingdom", opening in two phases, with the first phase in 2005, followed by the second phase in 2006.
This decision marked the end of the marine-life park permanently.All of the animal stadiums and buildings were next torn down or converted into other venues.
Some of the SeaWorld property remained intact, albeit hidden or modified.
What remained included the former seal and sea lion area, the Ski Stadium (to be used in a Lumberjack show in 2006), the Aquarium (to be used for unknown purposes), and two movie theater houses/simulators, once housing 3D/4D movies.
The Ski Stadium was removed in off-season 2008 to make way for "Coconut Cove", a refreshment station/observation area.
All of these, except for Wildwater Kingdom, closed in 2007.
What is the only place in the park where alcohol is served?
Minetown was modeled to resemble a mining town, just as its name says.
The section was officially opened in 1990 with the additions of Convoy, Red Baron, Flying Falcon and Dinosaur-Go-Round.
All except Dinosaur-Go-Round are still in the area; Dinosaur-Go-Round was moved to Founder’s Circle for the 2007 season so the Frog Hoppers could be moved to its location to make room for the Boardwalk.
The section features many classic Hersheypark attractions, including the Sunoco Twin Turnpike, Coal Cracker log flume, Kissing Tower and Great Bear.
It is also home to the Minetown Arcade, Minetown Restaurant, Hersheypark Amphitheater, Hersheypark Aquatheater and the Hersheypark entrance to ZooAmerica.
The Minetown Restaurant is a cafeteria style place, and is the only area in the park where alcohol is served.
What year did Six Flags open in the state of Georgia?
The original park, in Arlington (between Dallas and Fort Worth) was sold in 1966 to a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad, which was actively pursuing non-railroad investments in an effort to diversify its sources of income.
(In 1968, the Pennsylvania Railroad merged with the New York Central Railroad to form Penn Central Corp.) With the new owners came a more abundant supply of capital for geographic expansion and park additions.
Six Flags opened Six Flags Over Georgia in 1967 and Six Flags Over Mid-America in 1971, which would, along with Six Flags Over Texas, be the only three parks that would be constructed by the company.The company continued to grow by acquiring independent parks.
Six Flags purchased AstroWorld in Houston, Texas in 1975, Great Adventure in Jackson, New Jersey in 1977 and Magic Mountain in Valencia, California in 1979.
These purchases were followed by Penn Central selling assets to Bally Manufacturing in 1982.In 1984, the Great America theme park in Gurnee, Illinois was acquired from the Marriott hotel chain.Also in 1984, as a result of its acquisition of Great America, Six Flags acquired the rights to Time Warner/Warner Bros.' "Looney Tunes" animated characters for use in Six Flags properties.
Bally surrendered control of the chain to Wesray Capital Corporation in a 1987 leveraged buyout.
Time Warner quickly began to gain more leverage in the company, gaining a 19.5% stake in Six Flags in 1990 and then 50% in 1991, with the remaining shares of the company being split by Blackstone Group and Wertheim Schroder & Company.
Time Warner purchased the remaining stake in Six Flags in 1993, changing the company's name from "Six Flags Corp".
to "Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc".In 1996, Six Flags began to manage Fiesta Texas theme park in San Antonio, Texas and purchased the park from USAA in 1998.
What types of methods do various authors beieve were used to move Stonehenge?
Stonehenge was produced by a culture that left no written records.
Many aspects of Stonehenge remain subject to debate.
This multiplicity of theories, some of them very colourful, are often called the "mystery of Stonehenge".
A number of myths surround the stones.There is little or no direct evidence for the construction techniques used by the Stonehenge builders.
Over the years, various authors have suggested that supernatural or anachronistic methods were used, usually asserting that the stones were impossible to move otherwise.
However, conventional techniques, using Neolithic technology as basic as shear legs, have been demonstrably effective at moving and placing stones of a similar size.
Proposed functions for the site include usage as an astronomical observatory or as a religious site.More recently two major new theories have been proposed.
Professor Geoffrey Wainwright OBE, FSA, president of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and Professor Timothy Darvill, OBE of Bournemouth University have suggested that Stonehenge was a place of healing – the primeval equivalent of Lourdes.
They argue that this accounts for the high number of burials in the area and for the evidence of trauma deformity in some of the graves.
However they do concede that the site was probably multifunctional and used for ancestor worship as well.
Isotope analysis indicates that some of the buried individuals were from other regions.
A teenage boy buried approximately 1550 BC was raised near the Mediterranean Sea; a metal worker from 2300 BC dubbed the "Amesbury Archer" grew up near the alpine foothills of Germany; and the "Boscombe Bowmen" probably arrived from Wales or Brittany, France.
On the other hand, Professor Mike Parker Pearson of Sheffield University has suggested that Stonehenge was part of a ritual landscape and was joined to Durrington Walls by their corresponding avenues and the River Avon.
He suggests that the area around Durrington Walls Henge was a place of the living, whilst Stonehenge was a domain of the dead.
A journey along the Avon to reach Stonehenge was part of a ritual passage from life to death, to celebrate past ancestors and the recently deceased.
Both explanations were first mooted in the 12th century by Geoffrey of Monmouth (below), who extolled the curative properties of the stones and was also the first to advance the idea that Stonehenge was constructed as a funerary monument.
Whatever religious, mystical or spiritual elements were central to Stonehenge, its design includes a celestial observatory function, which might have allowed prediction of eclipse, solstice, equinox and other celestial events important to a contemporary religion.Another theory, brought forth in 2012, suggests that the monument was intended to unify the different peoples of the British island.
This theory suggests that the massive amount of labour involved in the construction of Stonehenge necessitated inter-regional cooperation, especially as many of the stones were moved over very long distances, for example from quarries in Wales.
What is the name of the training school for gladiators in the east.
The Colosseum and its activities supported a substantial industry in the area.
In addition to the amphitheatre itself, many other buildings nearby were linked to the games.
Immediately to the east is the remains of the "Ludus Magnus", a training school for gladiators.
This was connected to the Colosseum by an underground passage, to allow easy access for the gladiators.
The "Ludus Magnus" had its own miniature training arena, which was itself a popular attraction for Roman spectators.
Other training schools were in the same area, including the "Ludus Matutinus" (Morning School), where fighters of animals were trained, plus the Dacian and Gallic Schools.Also nearby were the "Armamentarium", comprising an armory to store weapons; the "Summum Choragium", where machinery was stored; the "Sanitarium", which had facilities to treat wounded gladiators; and the "Spoliarium", where bodies of dead gladiators were stripped of their armor and disposed of.Around the perimeter of the Colosseum, at a distance of 18 m (59 ft) from the perimeter, was a series of tall stone posts, with five remaining on the eastern side.
Various explanations have been advanced for their presence; they may have been a religious boundary, or an outer boundary for ticket checks, or an anchor for the "velarium" or awning.Right next to the Colosseum is also the Arch of Constantine.
Why were the beech crosspieces switched to maple in 1970?
Because the "Mona Lisa"'s poplar support expands and contracts with changes in humidity, the picture has experienced some warping.
In response to warping and swelling experienced during its storage during World War II, and to prepare the picture for an exhibit to honor the anniversary of Leonardo's 500th birthday, the "Mona Lisa" was fitted in 1951 with a flexible oak frame with beech crosspieces.
This flexible frame, which is used in addition to the decorative frame described below, exerts pressure on the panel to keep it from warping further.
In 1970, the beech crosspieces were switched to maple after it was found that the beechwood had been infested with insects.
In 2004–2005, a conservation and study team replaced the maple crosspieces with sycamore ones, and an additional metal crosspiece was added for scientific measurement of the panel's warp.The "Mona Lisa" has had many different decorative frames in its history, owing to changes in taste over the centuries.
In 1909, the Comtesse de Béhague gave the portrait its current frame, a Renaissance-era work consistent with the historical period of the "Mona Lisa".
The edges of the painting have been trimmed at least once in its history to fit the picture into various frames, but no part of the original paint layer has been trimmed.
To whom did Van Gogh write, "I should like to paint portraits which appear after a century to people living then as apparitons."
Although Van Gogh is best known for his landscapes, he seemed to find painting portraits his greatest ambition.
He said of portrait studies, "The only thing in painting that excites me to the depths of my soul, and which makes me feel the infinite more than anything else.
"To his sister he wrote, "I should like to paint portraits which appear after a century to people living then as apparitions.
By which I mean that I do not endeavor to achieve this through photographic resemblance, but my means of our impassioned emotions – that is to say using our knowledge and our modern taste for color as a means of arriving at the expression and the intensification of the character.
"Of painting portraits, Van Gogh wrote: "in a picture I want to say something comforting as music is comforting.
I want to paint men and women with that something of the eternal which the halo used to symbolize, and which we seek to communicate by the actual radiance and vibration of our coloring."
Which Pharaoh built a temple to the north east of the Sphinx 1000 years after it was built?
Colin Reader has proposed that the Sphinx was probably the focus of solar worship in the Early Dynastic Period, before the Giza Plateau became a necropolis in the Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2134 BC).
He ties this in with his conclusions that the Sphinx, the Sphinx temple, the Causeway and the Khafra mortuary temple are all part of a complex which predates Dynasty IV (c. 2613–2494 BC).
The lion has long been a symbol associated with the sun in ancient Near Eastern civilizations.
Images depicting the Egyptian king in the form of a lion smiting his enemies date as far back as the Early Dynastic Period.In the New Kingdom, the Sphinx became more specifically associated with the god "Hor-em-akhet" (Hellenized: "Harmachis") or Horus at the Horizon, which represented the pharaoh in his role as the "Shesep-ankh" (English: "Living Image") of the god Atum.
Pharaoh Amenhotep II (1427–1401 or 1397 BC) built a temple to the north east of the Sphinx nearly 1000 years after its construction, and dedicated it to the cult of "Hor-em-akhet".
When did Van Gogh go to the asylum at Saint-Remy?
In a letter written to Émile Bernard in April 1888, Van Gogh expressed his desire to paint the night sky, and questioned whether he could achieve his intention by painting from nature as the Impressionists did:In September 1888, before his December breakdown that resulted in his hospitalisation in Arles, he painted "Starry Night Over the Rhone".
Working by night under a gas lamp, Van Gogh painted this work directly from nature.
"It does me good to do what's difficult, "Van Gogh wrote, "That doesn’t stop me having a tremendous need for, shall I say the word—for religion—so I go outside at night to paint the stars.
"In May 1889, Van Gogh decided to enter the asylum at Saint-Rémy, where he stayed for the next year.
His time there was very productive, although interrupted by incapacitating nervous attacks.
Inspired by the landscape surrounding the asylum, he painted "Starry Night" in June 1889.
Unlike the earlier "Starry Night Over the Rhone", the new night scene was painted in daylight, from memory.
In mid-September 1889, following a heavy crisis which lasted from mid-July to the last days of August, he thought to include "Starry Night" in the next batch of works to be sent to his brother, Theo, in Paris.
In order to reduce the shipping costs, he withheld three of the studies, including "Starry Night".
These three went to Paris with the shipment that followed.
When Theo did not immediately report its arrival, Vincent inquired again and finally received Theo's commentary on his recent work.
What is the original German title of "The Scream"
The original German title given to the work by Munch is "Der Schrei der Natur" ("The Scream of Nature").
The Norwegian word "skrik" usually is translated as "scream", but is cognate with the English "shriek".
Occasionally, the painting also has been called "The Cry".In his diary in an entry headed, "Nice 22 January 1892", Munch described his inspiration for the image:This memory was later rendered by Munch as a poem, which he hand-painted onto the frame of the 1895 pastel version of the work:Among theories advanced to account for the reddish sky in the background is the artist's memory of the effects of the powerful volcanic eruption of Krakatoa, which deeply tinted sunset skies red in parts of the Western hemisphere for months during 1883 and 1884, about a decade before Munch painted "The Scream".
This explanation has been disputed by scholars, who note that Munch was an expressive painter and was not primarily interested in literal renderings of what he had seen.
Alternatively, it has been suggested that the proximity of both a slaughterhouse and a lunatic asylum to the site depicted in the painting may have offered some inspiration.
The scene was identified as being the view from a road overlooking Oslo, the Oslofjord and Hovedøya, from the hill of Ekeberg.
At the time of painting the work, Munch's manic depressive sister Laura Catherine was a patient at the asylum at the foot of Ekeberg.In 1978, the Munch scholar Robert Rosenblum suggested that the strange, sexless creature in the foreground of the painting was inspired by a Peruvian mummy, which Munch could have seen at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris.
This mummy, which was buried in a fetal position with its hands alongside its face, also struck the imagination of Munch's friend Paul Gauguin: it stood as a model for the central figure in his painting, "Human misery (Grape harvest at Arles)" and for the old woman at the left in his painting, "Where Do We Come From?
What Are We?
Where Are We Going?".
More recently, an Italian anthropologist speculated that Munch might have seen a mummy in Florence's Museum of Natural History, which bears an even more striking resemblance to the painting.The imagery of "The Scream" has been compared to that which an individual suffering from depersonalization disorder experiences, a feeling of distortion of the environment and one's self, and also facial pain.
What year did Dali paint "The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory" ?
Dalí returned to the theme of this painting with the variation "The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory" (1954), showing his earlier famous work systematically fragmenting into smaller component elements, and a series of rectangular blocks which reveal further imagery through the gaps between them, implying something beneath the surface of the original work; this work is now in the Dalí Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida, while the original "Persistence of Memory" remains at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.
Dalí also produced various lithographs and sculptures on the theme of soft watches late in his career.
Some of these sculptures are the "Persistence of Memory", the "Nobility of Time", the "Profile of Time" and the "Three Dancing Watches".
How many gospels mention the arrest of Jesus Peter?
In , , and Jesus predicts that Peter will deny knowledge of him, stating that Peter will disown him three times before the rooster crows the next morning.
The three Synoptic Gospels mention that after the arrest of Jesus Peter denied knowing him three times, but after the third denial, heard the rooster crow and recalled the prediction as Jesus turned to look at him.
Peter then began to cry bitterly.
What is the name of Anthony Weigh's play that featured the painting at the Art Institute?
The Depression-era understanding of the painting as a depiction of an authentically American scene prompted the first well-known parody, a 1942 photo by Gordon Parks of cleaning woman Ella Watson, shot in Washington, D.C."American Gothic" is one of the few paintings to achieve iconic cultural status, along with Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa" and Edvard Munch's "The Scream".
It is thus one of the most reproduced – and parodied – images ever made.
Many artists have replaced the two people with other known couples and replaced the house with well-known houses.References and parodies of the image have been numerous for generations, appearing regularly in such media as postcards, magazines, animated cartoons, advertisements, comic books, album covers, television shows and other artists.
The opening credits of the 1965 television show "Green Acres" had the main couple in an American Gothic-style pose; cinematic posters of the films "For Richer or Poorer", "Son In Law", "American Gothic", and "Good Fences" parody the painting.
It is also a key motif in Anthony Weigh's play "2,000 Feet Away", which opens with a scene featuring the painting at the Art Institute.
The painting was also parodied in a classic commercial for "New Country Corn Flakes", a General Mills product.A sculpture entitled "God Bless America" by sculptor John Seward Johnson II that features the "American Gothic" couple went on display in Chicago, Illinois, just south of the Tribune Tower on the Magnificent Mile of Michigan Avenue, in December 2008 but has been removed as of February 26, 2010.
The sculpture was displayed in Dubuque, Iowa at the Figge Art Museum and is now on the campus of Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa until at least December 31, 2013.
Postcards mimicking the couple with sitting US Presidents, Presidential nominees, and their spouses are popular commercial products.
Ohio State Buckeyes football games feature the painting on their scoreboard; within a few seconds of its display, the man's eyes bug out and his tongue wags.A 1963 "Saturday Evening Post" cover featured the cast of "The Beverly Hillbillies" in a parody of American Gothic with "Irene Ryan" and "Buddy Ebsen" posing like the 2 people in the painting flanked by "Max Baer" and "Donna Douglas" at their sides.David Ackles borrowed the title for his 1973 "American Gothic" album, as did The Smashing Pumpkins for their 2008 EP "American Gothic" and a 1995 television horror series created by Shaun Cassidy.
Elton John and RuPaul portray the couple on the video for a rerecording of "Don't Go Breaking My Heart" released in 1994.
Astrovamps parodied the painting on the cover of their album, "American Gothik".
The Ma and Pa couple at the beginning of the "Doctor Who" episode "Gridlock" are fashioned in the style of the couple in the painting.
The "American Gothic" couple have even been reinterpreted as Living Dead Dolls twice, in 2004 and 2009.
In the opening scene of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show", Richard O'Brien and Patricia Quinn appear as a farmer and his wife in parody of "American Gothic".
They are joined by a daughter dressed in the same fashion.
The painting is also seen on the wall in the castle during the song "Time Warp" as well as it is seen in the sequel "Shock Treatment"In the episode of "The Simpsons", "Bart Gets an Elephant", the Simpsons are revealed to evidently have the original "American Gothic" painting hanging on their living room wall.
Bart unwittingly scrubs it while cleaning the house, and rubs off all the paint.
Underneath, it reads "If you can read this, you scrubbed too hard.
Signed, Grant Wood.
"In the scene where Mulan's ancestors awaken Mushu in "Mulan", two of the ancestors appear as a parody of the farmer and his daughter, representing traditional values.The painting and its process of creation was parodied in a "Saturday Night Live" episode, which aired November 10, 2012, with host Anne Hathaway as Nan Wood Graham, Jason Sudeikis as Dr. Byron McKeeby, Tarran Killam as Grant Wood, and Kenan Thompson as a tour guide at The Art Institute of Chicago.
What does the "Dora Maar with Cat" painting by Pablo Picasso depict?
Dora Maar au Chat ("Dora Maar with Cat") is a 1941 painting by Pablo Picasso.

This work is one of the world's most expensive paintings.
What year was Frederick Bartlett appointed trustee of the Art Institute of Chicago?
In 1923, Frederick Bartlett was appointed trustee of the Art Institute of Chicago.
He and second wife, Helen Birch Bartlett, loaned their collection of French Post-Impressionist and Modernist art to the museum.
It was Mrs. Bartlett who had an interest in French and avant-garde artists and influenced her husband's collecting tastes.
"Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte" was purchased on the advice of the Art Institute of Chicago's curatorial staff in 1924.In conceptual artist Don Celender's 1974–5 book "Observation and Scholarship Examination for Art Historians, Museum Directors, Artists, Dealers and Collectors", it is claimed that the Institute paid $24,000.00 for the work).In 1958 the painting was loaned out for the only time – to the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.
On April 15, 1958, a fire there, which killed one person on the second floor of the museum, forced the evacuation of the painting which was on a floor above the fire in the Whitney Museum which adjoined MOMA at the time.

What year was Michelangelo born?
Life.Early life, 1475-88.Michelangelo was born on 6 March 1475 in Caprese near Arezzo, Tuscany.
(Today, Caprese is known as Caprese Michelangelo).
For several generations, his family had been small-scale bankers in Florence, the bank had failed and his father, Ludovico di Leonardo Buonarroti Simoni, briefly took a government post in Caprese, where Michelangelo was born.
At the time of Michelangelo's birth, his father was the Judicial administrator of the small town of Caprese and local administrator of Chiusi.
Michelangelo's mother was Francesca di Neri del Miniato di Siena.
The Buonarrotis claimed to descend from the Countess Mathilde of Canossa; this claim remains unproven, but Michelangelo himself believed it.
Several months after Michelangelo's birth, the family returned to Florence, where Michelangelo was raised.
At later times, during his mother's prolonged illness and after her death in 1481, when he was just six years old, Michelangelo lived with a stonecutter and his wife and family in the town of Settignano, where his father owned a marble quarry and a small farm.
Giorgio Vasari quotes Michelangelo: 
What was Leonard's first work of art?
Leonardo's early works begin with the "Baptism of Christ" painted in conjunction with Verrocchio.
Two other paintings appear to date from his time at the workshop, both of which are Annunciations.
One is small, long and high.
It is a "predella" to go at the base of a larger composition, in this case a painting by Lorenzo di Credi from which it has become separated.
The other is a much larger work, long.
In both these Annunciations, Leonardo used a formal arrangement, such as in Fra Angelico's two well-known pictures of the same subject, of the Virgin Mary sitting or kneeling to the right of the picture, approached from the left by an angel in profile, with a rich flowing garment, raised wings and bearing a lily.
Although previously attributed to Ghirlandaio, the larger work is now generally attributed to Leonardo.In the smaller picture Mary averts her eyes and folds her hands in a gesture that symbolised submission to God's will.
In the larger picture, however, Mary is not submissive.
The girl, interrupted in her reading by this unexpected messenger, puts a finger in her bible to mark the place and raises her hand in a formal gesture of greeting or surprise.
This calm young woman appears to accept her role as the Mother of God, not with resignation but with confidence.
In this painting the young Leonardo presents the humanist face of the Virgin Mary, recognising humanity's role in God's incarnation.

Who is the famous sculpture "The Thinker" done by?
The Thinker ("") is a bronze sculpture by Auguste Rodin, usually placed on a stone pedestal.
The work shows a nude male figure of over life-size sitting on a rock with his chin resting on one hand as though deep in thought, and is often used as an image to represent philosophy.
There are about 28 full size castings, in which the figure is about high, though not all were made during Rodin's lifetime and under his supervision, as well as various other versions, several in plaster, studies, and posthumous castings, in a range of sizes.
Rodin first conceived the figure as part of another work in 1880, but the first of the familiar monumental bronze castings did not appear until 1904.
Where is the Henry Moore Institute located?
Today, the Henry Moore Foundation manages the artist's former home at Perry Green in Hertfordshire as a visitor destination, with 70 acres of sculpture grounds as well as his restored house and studios.
It also runs the Henry Moore Institute in Leeds which organises exhibitions and research activities in international sculpture.
Popular interest in Moore's work was perceived by some to have declined for a while in the UK but has been revived in recent times by exhibitions including Henry Moore at Tate Britain in 2010 and Moore at Kew and Hatfield in 2007 and 2011 respectively.
The Foundation he endowed continues to play an essential role in promoting contemporary art in the United Kingdom and abroad through its grants and exhibitions programme.
How much did a autographed can of Campbell's soup sell for?
He began exhibiting his work during the 1950s.
He held exhibitions at the Hugo Gallery, and the Bodley Gallery in New York City and in California his first West Coast gallery exhibition was on July 9, 1962, in the Ferus Gallery of Los Angeles.
The exhibition marked his West Coast debut of pop art.Andy Warhol's first New York solo pop art exhibition was hosted at Eleanor Ward's Stable Gallery November 6–24, 1962.
The exhibit included the works "Marilyn Diptych", "100 Soup Cans", "100 Coke Bottles," and "100 Dollar Bills".
At the Stable Gallery exhibit, the artist met for the first time poet John Giorno who would star in Warhol's first film, "Sleep", in 1963.It was during the 1960s that Warhol began to make paintings of iconic American objects such as dollar bills, mushroom clouds, electric chairs, Campbell's Soup Cans, Coca-Cola bottles, celebrities such as Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, Marlon Brando, Troy Donahue, Muhammad Ali, and Elizabeth Taylor, as well as newspaper headlines or photographs of police dogs attacking civil rights protesters.
During these years, he founded his studio, "The Factory" and gathered about him a wide range of artists, writers, musicians, and underground celebrities.
His work became popular and controversial.
Warhol had this to say about Coca Cola:New York's Museum of Modern Art hosted a Symposium on pop art in December 1962 during which artists like Warhol were attacked for "capitulating" to consumerism.
Critics were scandalized by Warhol's open embrace of market culture.
This symposium set the tone for Warhol's reception.
Throughout the decade it became increasingly clear that there had been a profound change in the culture of the art world, and that Warhol was at the center of that shift.A pivotal event was the 1964 exhibit "The American Supermarket", a show held in Paul Bianchini's Upper East Side gallery.
The show was presented as a typical U.S. small supermarket environment, except that everything in it—from the produce, canned goods, meat, posters on the wall, etc.—was created by six prominent pop artists of the time, among them the controversial (and like-minded) Billy Apple, Mary Inman, and Robert Watts.
Warhol's painting of a can of Campbell's soup cost $1,500 while each autographed can sold for $6.
The exhibit was one of the first mass events that directly confronted the general public with both pop art and the perennial question of what art is.As an advertisement illustrator in the 1950s, Warhol used assistants to increase his productivity.
Collaboration would remain a defining (and controversial) aspect of his working methods throughout his career; this was particularly true in the 1960s.
One of the most important collaborators during this period was Gerard Malanga.
Malanga assisted the artist with the production of silkscreens, films, sculpture, and other works at "The Factory," Warhol's aluminum foil-and-silver-paint-lined studio on 47th Street (later moved to Broadway).
Other members of Warhol's Factory crowd included Freddie Herko, Ondine, Ronald Tavel, Mary Woronov, Billy Name, and Brigid Berlin (from whom he apparently got the idea to tape-record his phone conversations).During the 1960s, Warhol also groomed a retinue of bohemian and counterculture eccentrics upon whom he bestowed the designation "Superstars", including Nico, Joe Dallesandro, Edie Sedgwick, Viva, Ultra Violet, Holly Woodlawn, Jackie Curtis, and Candy Darling.
These people all participated in the Factory films, and some—like Berlin—remained friends with Warhol until his death.
Important figures in the New York underground art/cinema world, such as writer John Giorno and film-maker Jack Smith, also appear in Warhol films of the 1960s, revealing Warhol's connections to a diverse range of artistic scenes during this time.
Salvador Dalí suffered from what disease like symptoms?
In 1980 at age 76, Dalí's health took a catastrophic turn.
His right hand trembled terribly, with Parkinson-like symptoms.
His near-senile wife, Gala Dalí, allegedly had been dosing him with a dangerous cocktail of unprescribed medicine that damaged his nervous system, thus causing an untimely end to his artistic capacity.
In 1982, King Juan Carlos bestowed on Dalí the title of "Marqués de Dalí de Púbol" ("Marquis of Dalí de Púbol") in the nobility of Spain, hereby referring to Púbol, the place where he lived.
The title was in first instance hereditary, but on request of Dalí changed to life only in 1983.
To show his gratitude for this, Dalí later gave the king a drawing ("Head of Europa", which would turn out to be Dalí's final drawing) after the king visited him on his deathbed.Gala died on June 10, 1982, at the age of 87.
After Gala's death, Dalí lost much of his will to live.
He deliberately dehydrated himself, possibly as a suicide attempt, with claims stating he had tried to put himself into a state of suspended animation as he had read that some microorganisms could do.
He moved from Figueres to the castle in Púbol, which he had bought for Gala and had been the site of her death.
In 1984, a fire broke out in his bedroom under unclear circumstances.
It was possibly a suicide attempt by Dalí, or possibly simple negligence by his staff.
Dalí was rescued by friend and collaborator Robert Descharnes and returned to Figueres, where a group of his friends, patrons, and fellow artists saw to it that he was comfortable living in his Theater-Museum in his final years.There have been allegations that Dalí was forced by his guardians to sign blank canvases that would later, even after his death, be used in forgeries and sold as originals.
As a result, art dealers tend to be wary of late works attributed to Dalí.In November 1988, Dalí entered the hospital with heart failure; a pacemaker had already been implanted previously.
On December 5, 1988, he was visited by King Juan Carlos, who confessed that he had always been a serious devotee of Dalí.On January 23, 1989, while his favorite record of "Tristan and Isolde" played, he died of heart failure at Figueres at the age of 84.
He is buried in the crypt of his Teatro Museo in Figueres.
The location is across the street from the church of "Sant Pere", where he had his baptism, first communion, and funeral, and is only three blocks from the house where he was born.The Gala-Salvador Dalí Foundation currently serves as his official estate.
The US copyright representative for the Gala-Salvador Dalí Foundation is the Artists Rights Society.
In 2002, the Society made the news when they asked Google to remove a customized version of its logo put up to commemorate Dalí, alleging that portions of specific artworks under their protection had been used without permission.
Google complied with the request, but denied that there was any copyright violation.
Why did Pollock number his paintings instead of naming them?
Continuing to evade the viewer's search for figurative elements in his paintings, Pollock abandoned titles and started numbering his works.
He said about this: "...look passively and try to receive what the painting has to offer and not bring a subject matter or preconceived idea of what they are to be looking for".
Pollock's wife, Lee Krasner, said Pollock "used to give his pictures conventional titles... but now he simply numbers them.
Numbers are neutral.
They make people look at a picture for what it is—pure painting."
Which gender did Matisse and Picasso most often paint in their younger years?
Around April 1906 he met Pablo Picasso, who was 11 years younger than Matisse.
The two became lifelong friends as well as rivals and are often compared; one key difference between them is that Matisse drew and painted from nature, while Picasso was much more inclined to work from imagination.
The subjects painted most frequently by both artists were women and still life, with Matisse more likely to place his figures in fully realised interiors.
Matisse and Picasso were first brought together at the Paris salon of Gertrude Stein and her companion Alice B. Toklas.
During the first decade of the twentieth century, the Americans in Paris— Gertrude Stein, her brothers Leo Stein, Michael Stein and Michael's wife Sarah—were important collectors and supporters of Matisse's paintings.
In addition Gertrude Stein's two American friends from Baltimore, the Cone sisters Claribel and Etta, became major patrons of Matisse and Picasso, collecting hundreds of their paintings and drawings.
The Cone collection is now exhibited in the Baltimore Museum of Art.While numerous artists visited the Stein salon, many of these artists were not represented among the paintings on the walls at 27 rue de Fleurus.
Where Renoir, Cézanne, Matisse, and Picasso's works dominated Leo and Gertrude Stein's collection, Sarah Stein's collection particularly emphasised Matisse.Contemporaries of Leo and Gertrude Stein, Matisse and Picasso became part of their social circle and routinely joined the gatherings that took place on Saturday evenings at 27 rue de Fleurus.
Gertrude attributed the beginnings of the Saturday evening salons to Matisse, remarking:"More and more frequently, people began visiting to see the Matisse paintings—and the Cézannes: Matisse brought people, everybody brought somebody, and they came at any time and it began to be a nuisance, and it was in this way that Saturday evenings began.
"'Among Pablo Picasso's acquaintances who also frequented the Saturday evenings were: Fernande Olivier (Picasso's mistress), Georges Braque, André Derain, the poets Max Jacob and Guillaume Apollinaire, Marie Laurencin (Apollinaire's mistress and an artist in her own right), and Henri Rousseau.His friends organised and financed the "Académie Matisse" in Paris, a private and non-commercial school in which Matisse instructed young artists.
It operated from 1907 until 1911.
Hans Purrmann and Sarah Stein were amongst several of his most loyal students.Matisse spent seven months in Morocco from 1912 to 1913, producing about 24 paintings and numerous drawings.
His frequent orientalist topics of later paintings, such as odalisques, can be traced to this period.
How many national teams compete in the World Cup qualifying rounds?
The major international competition in football is the World Cup, organised by FIFA.
This competition takes place over every four years.
Approximately 190–200 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental confederations for a place in the finals.
The finals tournament, which is held every four years, involves 32 national teams competing over a four-week period.
The most recent tournament, the 2010 FIFA World Cup, was held in South Africa from 11 June to 11 July, the first to be held on the African continent.There has been a football tournament at every Summer Olympic Games since 1900, except at the 1932 games in Los Angeles.
Before the inception of the World Cup, the Olympics (especially during the 1920s) had the same status as the World Cup.
Originally, the event was for amateurs only; however, since the 1984 Summer Olympics, professional players have been permitted, albeit with certain restrictions which prevent countries from fielding their strongest sides.
The Olympic men's tournament is played at Under-23 level.
In the past the Olympics have allowed a restricted number of over-age players per team;.
A women's tournament was added in 1996; in contrast to the men's event, full international sides without age restrictions play the women's Olympic tournament.After the World Cup, the most important international football competitions are the continental championships, which are organised by each continental confederation and contested between national teams.
These are the European Championship (UEFA), the Copa América (CONMEBOL), African Cup of Nations (CAF), the Asian Cup (AFC), the CONCACAF Gold Cup (CONCACAF) and the OFC Nations Cup (OFC).
The FIFA Confederations Cup is contested by the winners of all six continental championships, the current FIFA World Cup champions and the country which is hosting the Confederations Cup.
This is generally regarded as a warm-up tournament for the upcoming FIFA World Cup and does not carry the same prestige as the World Cup itself.
The most prestigious competitions in club football are the respective continental championships, which are generally contested between national champions, for example the UEFA Champions League in Europe and the Copa Libertadores de América in South America.
The winners of each continental competition contest the FIFA Club World Cup.
In which years was football banned in England?
Numerous attempts have been made to ban football games, particularly the most rowdy and disruptive forms.
This was especially the case in England and in other parts of Europe, during the Middle Ages and early modern period.
Between 1324 and 1667, football was banned in England alone by more than 30 royal and local laws.
The need to repeatedly proclaim such laws demonstrated the difficulty in enforcing bans on popular games.King Edward II was so troubled by the unruliness of football in London that on April 13, 1314 he issued a proclamation banning it: "Forasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large balls from which many evils may arise which God forbid; we command and forbid, on behalf of the King, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future.
"The reasons for the ban by Edward III, on June 12, 1349, were explicit: football and other recreations distracted the populace from practicing archery, which was necessary for war.
In 1424, the Parliament of Scotland passed a Football Act that stated "it is statut and the king forbiddis that na man play at the fut ball under the payne of iiij d" – in other words, playing football was made illegal, and punishable by a fine of four pence.By 1608, the local authorities in Manchester were complaining that: "With the ffotebale...hath beene greate disorder in our towne of Manchester we are told, and glasse windowes broken yearlye and spoyled by a companie of lewd and disordered persons ..." That same year, the word"football" was used disapprovingly by William Shakespeare.
Shakespeare's play "King Lear" contains the line: "Nor tripped neither, you base football player" (Act I, Scene 4).Shakespeare also mentions the game in "A Comedy of Errors" (Act II, Scene 1):"Spurn" literally means "to kick away", thus implying that the game involved kicking a ball between players.King James I of England's "Book of Sports" (1618) however, instructs Christians to play at football every Sunday afternoon after worship.
The book's aim appears to be an attempt to offset the strictness of the Puritans regarding the keeping of the Sabbath.
Is it true or false that by the late 19th century baseball was recognized as the national sport of the United states?
Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players who take turns batting and fielding.The offense attempts to score runs by hitting a ball thrown by the pitcher with a bat and moving counter-clockwise around a series of four bases: first, second, third and home plate.
A run is scored when the runner advances around the bases and returns to home plate.Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways.
A player on the batting team can stop at any of the bases and later advance on a teammate's hit or other means.
The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs.
One turn at bat for both teams, beginning with the visiting team, constitutes an inning, and nine innings a game.
The team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins.Evolving from older bat-and-ball games, an early form of baseball was being played in England by the mid-18th century.
This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed.
By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States.
Baseball is now popular in North America and parts of Central and South America and the Caribbean, East Asia and Europe.In the United States and Canada, professional Major League Baseball (MLB) teams are divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central.
The major league champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series.
The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the Central League and Pacific Leagues and in Cuba between the West League and East League.
What is the objective of rebounding?
The objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession of the basketball after a missed field goal or free throw, as it rebounds from the hoop or backboard.
This plays a major role in the game, as most possessions end when a team misses a shot.
There are two categories of rebounds: offensive rebounds, in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession, and defensive rebounds, in which the defending team gains possession of the loose ball.
The majority of rebounds are defensive, as the team on defense tends to be in better position to recover missed shots.
How many Grand slam tournements are there?
The four Grand Slam tournaments are considered to be the most prestigious tennis events in the world.
They are held annually and comprise, in chronological order, the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open.
Apart from the Olympic Games, Davis Cup, Fed Cup, and Hopman Cup, they are the only tournaments regulated by the International Tennis Federation (ITF).
The ITF's national associations, Tennis Australia (Australian Open), the Fédération Française de Tennis (French Open), the Lawn Tennis Association (Wimbledon) and the United States Tennis Association (US Open) are delegated the responsibility to organize these events.Aside from the historical significance of these events, they also carry larger prize funds than any other tour event and are worth double the number of ranking points to the champion than in the next echelon of tournaments, the Masters 1000 (men) and Premier events (women).
Another distinguishing feature is the number of players in the singles draw.
There are 128, more than any other professional tennis tournament.
This draw is composed of 32 seeded players, other players ranked in the world's top 100, qualifiers, and players who receive invitations through wild cards.
Grand Slam men's tournaments have best-of-five set matches while the women play best-of-three.
Grand Slam tournaments are among the small number of events that last two weeks, the others being the Indian Wells Masters and the Miami Masters.Currently, the Grand Slam tournaments are the only tour events that have mixed doubles contests.
Grand Slam tournaments are held in conjunction with wheelchair tennis tournaments and junior tennis competitions.
These tournaments also contain their own idiosyncrasies.
For example, players at Wimbledon are required to wear predominantly white.
Andre Agassi chose to skip Wimbledon from 1988 through 1990 citing the event's traditionalism, particularly its "predominantly white" dress code.
Wimbledon has its own particular methods for disseminating tickets, often leading tennis fans to follow complex procedures to obtain tickets.
 The international tournament began in 1925
The curriculum for which grade states that all children should learn to swim as well as handle emergencies near water in Sweden?
Children generally do not swim independently until 4 years of age.In Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Estonia and Finland, the curriculum for the fifth grade (fourth grade in Estonia) states that all children should learn how to swim as well as how to handle emergencies near water.
Most commonly, children are expected to be able to swim – of which at least on their back – after first falling into deep water and getting their head under water.
Even though about 95 percent of Swedish school children know how to swim, drowning remains the third most common cause of death among children.In both the Netherlands and Belgium swimming lessons under school time ("schoolzwemmen", school swimming) are supported by the government.
Most schools provide swimming lessons.
There is a long tradition of swimming lessons in the Netherlands and Belgium, the Dutch translation for the breaststroke swimming style is even "schoolslag" (schoolstroke).
The children learn a variant of the breaststroke, which is technically not entirely correct.
In France, swimming is a compulsory part of the curriculum for primary schools.
Children usually spend one semester per year learning swimming during CE1/CE2/CM1 (2nd, 3rd and 4th grade).
In many places, swimming lessons are provided by local swimming pools, both those run by the local authority and by private leisure companies.
Many schools also include swimming lessons into their Physical Education curricula, provided either in the schools' own pool, or in the nearest public pool.
In the UK, the "Top-ups scheme" calls for school children who cannot swim by the age of 11 to receive intensive daily lessons.
These children who have not reached Great Britain's National Curriculum standard of swimming 25 metres by the time they leave primary school will be given a half-hour lesson every day for two weeks during term-time.In Canada and Mexico there has been a call for swimming to be included in the public school curriculum.In USA there is the Infant Swimming Resource (ISR) initiative that provides lessons for infant children, to cope with emergency situation when they have fallen into water.
They are learned how to roll-back-to-float (hold their breath underwater, to roll onto their back, to float unassisted, rest and breathe until help arrives).
What is usually the second contact that the team makes with the ball?
The set is usually the second contact that a team makes with the ball.
The main goal of setting is to put the ball in the air in such a way that it can be driven by an attack into the opponent's court.
The setter coordinates the offensive movements of a team, and is the player who ultimately decides which player will actually attack the ball.As with passing, one may distinguish between an overhand and a bump set.
Since the former allows for more control over the speed and direction of the ball, the bump is used only when the ball is so low it cannot be properly handled with fingertips, or in beach volleyball where rules regulating overhand setting are more stringent.
In the case of a set, one also speaks of a front or back set, meaning whether the ball is passed in the direction the setter is facing or behind the setter.
There is also a jump set that is used when the ball is too close to the net.
In this case the setter usually jumps off his or her right foot straight up to avoid going into the net.
The setter usually stands about ⅔ of the way from the left to the right of the net and faces the left (the larger portion of net that he or she can see).Sometimes a setter refrains from raising the ball for a teammate to perform an attack and tries to play it directly onto the opponent's court.
This movement is called a "dump".
This can only be performed when the setter is in the front row, otherwise it constitutes an illegal back court attack.
The most common dumps are to 'throw' the ball behind the setter or in front of the setter to zones 2 and 4.
More experienced setters toss the ball into the deep corners or spike the ball on the second hit.
What penalty will a golfer incur after hitting a golfer's ball during a putt?
Penalties are incurred in certain situations.
They are counted towards a player's score as if there were extra swing(s) at the ball.
Strokes are added for rule infractions or for hitting one's ball into an unplayable situation.A lost ball or a ball hit out of bounds result in a penalty of one stroke and distance (Rule 27–1).
A one-stroke penalty is assessed if a player's equipment causes the ball to move or the removal of a loose impediment causes the ball to move (Rule 18–2).
If a golfer makes a stroke at the wrong ball (Rule 19–2) or hits a fellow golfer's ball with a putt (Rule 19–5), the player incurs a two-stroke penalty.
Most rule infractions lead to stroke penalties but also can lead to disqualification.
Disqualification could be from cheating, signing for a lower score, or from rule infractions that lead to improper play.
Is badminton considered the fastest racquet sport?
Statistics such as the smash speed, above, prompt badminton enthusiasts to make other comparisons that are more contentious.
For example, it is often claimed that badminton is the fastest racquet sport.
Although badminton holds the record for the fastest initial speed of a racket sports projectile, the shuttlecock decelerates substantially faster than other projectiles such as tennis balls.
In turn, this qualification must be qualified by consideration of the distance over which the shuttlecock travels: a smashed shuttlecock travels a shorter distance than a tennis ball during a serve.
Badminton's claim as the fastest racquet sport might also be based on reaction time requirements, but arguably table tennis requires even faster reaction times.While fans of badminton and tennis often claim that their sport is the more physically demanding, such comparisons are difficult to make objectively because of the differing demands of the games.
No formal study currently exists evaluating the physical condition of the players or demands during game play.
Does landing difficult tricks ensure a victory?
Competitors perform tricks while descending a course, moving around, over, across, up, or down terrain features.
The course is full of obstacles including boxes, rails, jumps, jibs (includes anything the board or rider can slide across).Slope-style contests consists of choosing your own line in a terrain park using a variety of boxes, jibs and jumps.
To win a slope-style contest one must pick the best and most difficult line in the terrain park and have a smooth flowing line of tricks performed on the obstacles.
Overall impression is also a huge factor in winning a slope-style contest.
The rider who lands the hardest tricks will not always win over the rider who lands easy
Where is the head office of the FIE?
Competitive fencing.Governing body.Fencing is governed by Fédération Internationale d'Escrime or FIE.
Today, its head office is in Lausanne, Switzerland.
The FIE is composed of 145 national federations, each of which is recognized by its country's Olympic Committee as the sole representative of Olympic-style fencing in that country.
What do most archers wear to protect the inside of their arm from being  hit by the bow string?
Most archers wear a bracer (also known as an arm-guard) to protect the inside of the bow arm from being hit by the string and prevent clothing from catching the bow string.
The bracer does not brace the arm; the word comes from the armoury term "brassard", meaning an armoured sleeve or badge.
The Navajo people have developed highly ornamented bracers as non-functional items of adornment.
Some archers (mostly women) also wear protection on their chests, called chestguards or plastrons.
The myth of the Amazons was that they had one breast removed to solve this problem.
Roger Ascham mentions one archer, presumably with an unusual shooting style, who wore a leather guard for his face.The drawing digits are normally protected by a leather tab, glove, or thumb ring.
A simple tab of leather is commonly used, as is a skeleton glove.
Medieval Europeans probably used a complete leather glove.Eurasiatic archers who used the thumb or Mongolian draw protected their thumbs, usually with leather according to the author of "Arab Archery", but also with special rings of various hard materials.
Many surviving Turkish and Chinese examples are works of considerable art.
Some are so highly ornamented that the users could not have used them to loose an arrow.
Possibly these were items of personal adornment, and hence value, remaining extant whilst leather had virtually no intrinsic value and would also deteriorate with time.
In traditional Japanese archery a special glove is used, provided with a ridge which is used to draw the string.
Where is the wrestler Alexander Karelin from?
Greco-Roman is an international discipline and an Olympic sport.
In Greco-Roman style, it is forbidden to hold the opponent below the belt, to make trips, and to actively use the legs in the execution of any action.
Recent rule changes in Greco-Roman increase opportunities for and place greater emphasis on explosive, 'high amplitude' throws.
Pinning one's opponent to the mat is one way of winning.
One of the most well known Greco-Roman wrestlers is Alexander Karelin from Russia.
How many types of organizations are there that rank boxers?

How many wheelchair athletes competed in 1986?
Many marathons feature a wheelchair division.
Typically, those in the wheelchair racing division start their races earlier than their running counterparts.The first wheelchair marathon was in 1974 in Toledo, Ohio, won by Bob Hall in 2:54.
Hall competed in the 1975 Boston Marathon and finished in 2:58, inaugurating the introduction of wheelchair divisions into the Boston Marathon.
From 1977 the race was declared the US National Wheelchair championship.
The Boston Marathon awards $10,000 to the winning push-rim athlete.
Ernst van Dyk has won the Boston Marathon wheelchair division nine times and holds the world record at 1:18:27, set in Boston in 2004.
Jean Driscoll won eight times (seven consecutively) and holds the women's world record at 1:34:22.The New York City Marathon banned wheelchair entrants in 1977, citing safety concerns, but then voluntarily allowed Bob Hall to compete after the state Division of Human Rights ordered the marathon to show cause.
The Division ruled in 1979 that the New York City Marathon and New York Road Runners club had to allow wheelchair athletes to compete, and confirmed this at appeal in 1980, but the State Supreme Court ruled in 1981 that a ban on wheelchair racers was not discriminatory as the marathon was historically a foot race.
However, by 1986 14 wheelchair athletes were competing, and an official wheelchair division was added to the marathon in 2000.
Which body part is the most common location for injuries?
Although taekwondo competitors have an apparently substantial risk of injury, most injuries are minor.
A 2009 meta-analysis reported that an average of about 8% of competitors are injured per exposure to competition.
Age, gender, and level of play did not significantly affect the injury rate.
The legs are the most common location for injuries, and bruising is the most common injury type.Injuries may occur if students are taught to block punches in a formal manner (chamber position, perfect angles, etc.)
even when sparring.
When comparing the speed of a punch and the reaction time taken to block effectively, it is difficult to block a punch.
Many taekwondo schools teach students blocking for grading and classwork, and dodging or parrying for sparring.
Which things play an important role when one is handling a rifle or handgun?
Marksmanship has inspired competition, and in several countries rifle clubs started to form in the 19th century.
Soon international shooting events evolved, including shooting at the Summer Olympics (from 1896) and World Championships (from 1897).
The International Shooting Sport Federation still administers Olympic and non-Olympic rifle, pistol, shotgun, and running target shooting competitions, although there is also a large number of national and international shooting sports controlled by unrelated organizations.Shooting technique differs depending on factors like the type of firearm used (from a handgun to a sniper rifle; the distance to and nature of the target; the required precision; and the available time.
Breathing and position play an important role when handling a handgun or a rifle.
Some shooting sports, such as IPSC shooting, make a sport of combat style shooting.
The prone position, kneeling position, and standing position offer different amounts of support for the shooter.
What is another term for Waza?
 "waza" (techniques).There are three basic categories of in judo: , and .
Judo is most known for "nage-waza" and "katame-waza".Judo practitioners typically devote a portion of each practice session to , in order that "nage-waza" can be practiced without significant risk of injury.
Several distinct types of "ukemi" exist, including ; ; ; and The person who performs a "Waza" is known as and the person to whom it is performed is known as .
How is a point scored in Table Tennis?
A point is scored by the player for any of several results of the rally:
 The opponent fails to make a correct service or return.
 After making a service or a return, the ball touches anything other than the net assembly before being A game shall be won by the player first scoring 11 points unless both players score 10 points, when the game shall be won by the first player subsequently gaining a lead of 2 points.
A match shall consist of the best of any odd number of games.
In competition play, matches are typically best of five or seven games.
In which category have Americans received the most Nobel Prizes?
The United States has life expectancy of 78.4 years at birth, up from 75.2 years in 1990, ranks it 50th among 221 nations, and 27th out of the 34 industrialized OECD countries, down from 20th in 1990.
Increasing obesity in the United States and health improvements elsewhere have contributed to lowering the country's rank in life expectancy from 1987, when it was 11th in the world.
Obesity rates in the United States are among the highest in the world.
Approximately one-third of the adult population is obese and an additional third is overweight; the obesity rate, the highest in the industrialized world, has more than doubled in the last quarter-century.
Obesity-related type 2 diabetes is considered epidemic by health care professionals.
The infant mortality rate of 6.06 per thousand places the United States 176th highest out of 222 countries.In 2010, coronary artery disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and traffic accidents caused the most years of life lost in the U.S. Low back pain, depression, musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain, and anxiety caused the most years lost to disability.
The most deleterious risk factors were poor diet, tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, physical inactivity, and alcohol use.
Alzheimer's disease, drug abuse, kidney disease and cancer, and falls caused the most additional years of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates.
U.S. teenage pregnancy and abortion rates are substantially higher than in other Western nations.The U.S. is a global leader in medical innovation.
America solely developed or contributed significantly to 9 of the top 10 most important medical innovations since 1975 as ranked by a 2001 poll of physicians, while the EU and Switzerland together contributed to five.
Since 1966, Americans have received more Nobel Prizes in Medicine than the rest of the world.
From 1989 to 2002, four times more money was invested in private biotechnology companies in America than in Europe.
The U.S. health-care system far outspends any other nation, measured in both per capita spending and percentage of GDP.
Health-care coverage in the United States is a combination of public and private efforts and is not universal.
In 2010, 49.9 million residents or 16.3% of the population did not carry health insurance.
The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans is a major political issue.
In 2006, Massachusetts became the first state to mandate universal health insurance.
Federal legislation passed in early 2010 would ostensibly create a near-universal health insurance system around the country by 2014, though the bill and its ultimate impact are issues of controversy.
What years do fossils at Zhoukoudian date back to?
History.Prehistory.Archaeological evidence suggests that early hominids inhabited China between 250,000 and 2.24 million years ago.
A cave in Zhoukoudian (near present-day Beijing) exhibits hominid fossils dated at between 680,000 and 780,000 BCE.
The fossils are of Peking Man, an example of "Homo erectus" who used fire.
The Peking Man site has also yielded remains of "Homo sapiens" dating back to 18,000–11,000 BCE.
Some scholars assert that a form of proto-writing existed in China as early as 3000 BCE.According to Chinese tradition, the first imperial dynasty was the Xia, which emerged around 2070 BCE.
However, the dynasty was considered mythical by historians until scientific excavations found early Bronze Age sites at Erlitou, Henan in 1959.
It remains unclear whether these sites are the remains of the Xia Dynasty or of another culture from the same period.
How many Orthodox churches have been rebuilt since 1991?
Since the Christianization of Kievan Rus' for several ages Russian architecture was influenced predominantly by the Byzantine architecture.
Apart from fortifications (kremlins), the main stone buildings of ancient Rus' were Orthodox churches with their many domes, often gilded or brightly painted.Aristotle Fioravanti and other Italian architects brought Renaissance trends into Russia since the late 15th century, while the 16th century saw the development of unique tent-like churches culminating in Saint Basil's Cathedral.
By that time the onion dome design was also fully developed.
In the 17th century, the "fiery style" of ornamentation flourished in Moscow and Yaroslavl, gradually paving the way for the Naryshkin baroque of the 1690s.
After the reforms of Peter the Great the change of architectural styles in Russia generally followed that in the Western Europe.The 18th-century taste for rococo architecture led to the ornate works of Bartolomeo Rastrelli and his followers.
The reigns of Catherine the Great and her grandson Alexander I saw the flourishing of Neoclassical architecture, most notably in the capital city of Saint Petersburg.
The second half of the 19th century was dominated by the Neo-Byzantine and Russian Revival styles.
Prevalent styles of the 20th century were the Art Nouveau, Constructivism, and the Stalin Empire style.In 1955, a new Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, condemned the "excesses" of the former academic architecture, and the late Soviet era was dominated by plain functionalism in architecture.
This helped somewhat to resolve the housing problem, but created a large quantity of buildings of low architectural quality, much in contrast with the previous bright styles.
The situation improved in the recent two decades.
Many temples demolished in Soviet times were rebuilt, and this process continues along with the restoration of various historical buildings destroyed in World War II.
A total of 23,000 Orthodox churches have been rebuilt between 1991 and 2010, which effectively quadrapled the number of operating churches in Russia.
Which type of art was popular in Winchester and Canterbury?
The earliest known examples are the prehistoric rock and cave art pieces, most prominent in North Yorkshire, Northumberland and Cumbria, but also feature further south, for example at Creswell Crags.
With the arrival of Roman culture in the 1st century, various forms of art utilising statues, busts, glasswork and mosaics were the norm.
There are numerous surviving artefacts, such as those at Lullingstone and Aldborough.
During the Early Middle Ages the style favoured sculpted crosses and ivories, manuscript painting, gold and enamel jewellery, demonstrating a love of intricate, interwoven designs such as in the Staffordshire Hoard discovered in 2009.
Some of these blended Gaelic and Anglian styles, such as the Lindisfarne Gospels and Vespasian Psalter.
Later Gothic art was popular at Winchester and Canterbury, examples survive such as Benedictional of St. Æthelwold and Luttrell Psalter.The Tudor era saw prominent artists as part of their court, portrait painting which would remain an enduring part of English art, was boosted by German Hans Holbein, natives such as Nicholas Hilliard built on this.
Under the Stuarts, Continental artists were influential especially the Flemish, examples from the period include—Anthony van Dyck, Peter Lely, Godfrey Kneller and William Dobson.
The 18th century was a time of significance with the founding of the Royal Academy, a classicism based on the High Renaissance prevailed—Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds became two of England's most treasured artists.The Norwich School continued the landscape tradition, while the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood with their vivid and detailed style revived the Early Renaissance style—Holman Hunt, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Everett Millais were leaders.
Prominent amongst 20th-century artists was Henry Moore, regarded as the voice of British sculpture, and of British modernism in general.
Contemporary painters include Lucian Freud, whose work "Benefits Supervisor Sleeping" in 2008 set a world record for sale value of a painting by a living artist.
What percentage of France's citizens have a favorable of the US?
According to a BBC poll in 2010, based on 29,977 responses in 28 countries, France is globally seen as a positive influence in the world's affairs: 49% have a positive view of the country's influence, whereas 19% have a negative view.
The Nation Brand Index of 2008 suggested that France has the second best international reputation, only behind Germany.According to a poll in 2011, the French were found to have the highest level of religious tolerance and to be the country where the highest proportion of the population defines its identity primarily in term of nationality and not religion.
69% of French have a favourable view of the US, making France one of the most pro-American countries in the world.In January 2010, the magazine International Living ranked France as "best country to live in", ahead of 193 other countries, for the fifth year running.The French Revolution continues to permeate the country's collective memory.
The tricolour flag, the anthem "La Marseillaise", and the motto Liberté, egalité, fraternité, defined in Title 1 of the Constitution as national symbols, all emerged during the cultural ferment of the early revolution, along with Marianne, a common national personification.
In addition, Bastille Day, the national holiday, commemorates the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789.A common and traditional symbol of the French people is the Gallic rooster.
Its origins date back to Antiquity, since the Latin word Gallus meant both "rooster" and "inhabitant of Gaul".
Then this figure gradually became the most widely shared representation of the French, used by French monarchs, then by the Revolution and under the successive republican regimes as representation of the national identity, used for some stamps and coins.
What were heated floors in ancient buildings called?
Because of South Korea's tumultuous history, construction and destruction has been repeated endlessly, resulting in an interesting melange of architectural styles and designs.Korean traditional architecture is characterized by its harmony with nature.
Ancient architects adopted the bracket system characterized by thatched roofs and heated floors called "ondol".
People of the upper classes built bigger houses with elegantly curved tiled roofs with lifting eaves.
Traditional architecture can be seen in the palaces and temples, preserved old houses called "hanok", and special sites like Hahoe Folk Village, Yangdong Village of Gyeongju and Korean Folk Village.
Traditional architecture may also be seen at the nine UNESCO World Heritage Sites in South Korea.Western architecture was first introduced to Korea at the end of the 19th century.
Churches, offices for foreign legislation, schools and university buildings were built in new styles.
With the annexation of Korea by Japan in 1910 the colonial regime intervened in Korea's architectural heritage, and Japanese-style modern architecture was imposed.
The anti-Japanese sentiment, and the Korean War, led to the destruction of most buildings constructed during that time.Korean architecture entered a new phase of development during the post-Korean War reconstruction, incorporating modern architectural trends and styles.
Stimulated by the economic growth in the 1970s and 1980s, active redevelopment saw new horizons in architectural design.
In the aftermath of the 1988 Seoul Olympics, South Korea has witnessed a wide variation of styles in its architectural landscape due, in large part, to the opening up of the market to foreign architects.
Contemporary architectural efforts have been constantly trying to balance the traditional philosophy of "harmony with nature" and the fast-paced urbanization that the country has been going through in recent years.
In Japan what percentage of the population speak Japanese as their first language?
More than 99 percent of the population speaks Japanese as their first language.
Japanese is an agglutinative language distinguished by a system of honorifics reflecting the hierarchical nature of Japanese society, with verb forms and particular vocabulary indicating the relative status of speaker and listener.
Japanese writing uses kanji (Chinese characters) and two sets of kana (syllabaries based on simplified Chinese characters), as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals.Besides Japanese, the Ryukyuan languages (Amami, Kunigami, Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama, Yonaguni), also part of the Japonic language family, are spoken in the Ryukyu Islands chain.
Few children learn these languages, but in recent years the local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages.
The Okinawan Japanese dialect is also spoken in the region.
The Ainu language, which has no proven relationship to Japanese or any other language, is moribund, with only a few elderly native speakers remaining in Hokkaido.
Most public and private schools require students to take courses in both Japanese and English.
Which country produces the world's most-watched cinema?
The Indian film industry produces the world's most-watched cinema.
Established regional cinematic traditions exist in the Assamese, Bengali, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Oriya, Tamil, and Telugu languages.
South Indian cinema attracts more than 75% of national film revenue.
Television broadcasting began in India in 1959 as a state-run medium of communication, and had slow expansion for more than two decades.
The state monopoly on television broadcast ended in the 1990s and, since then, satellite channels have increasingly shaped popular culture of Indian society.
Today, television is the most penetrative media in India; industry estimates indicate that as of 2012 there are over 554 million TV consumers, 462 million with satellite and/or cable connections, compared to other forms of mass media such as press (350 million), radio (156 million) or internet (37 million).
After which war did Indonesia secure it's independence?
Indonesia ( or ), officially the Republic of Indonesia ( ), is a sovereign state in Southeast Asia and Oceania.
Indonesia is an archipelago comprising 13,466 islands.
It encompasses 33 provinces and 1 Special Administrative Region (for being governed by a pre-colonial monarchy) with over 238 million people, making it the world's fourth most populous country.
Indonesia's republic form of government comprises an elected legislature and president.
The nation's capital city is Jakarta.
The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea, East Timor, and Malaysia.
Other neighboring countries include Singapore, the Philippines, Australia, Palau, and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
Indonesia is a founding member of ASEAN and a member of the G-20 major economies.
The Indonesian economy is the world's 16th largest by nominal GDP.The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the 7th century, when Srivijaya and then later Majapahit traded with China and India.
Local rulers gradually absorbed foreign cultural, religious and political models from the early centuries CE, and Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished.
Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources.
Muslim traders brought the now-dominant Islam, while European powers brought Christianity and fought one another to monopolize trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Discovery.
Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism, Indonesia secured its independence after World War II.
Indonesia's history has since been turbulent, with challenges posed by natural disasters, corruption, separatism, a democratization process, and periods of rapid economic change.Indonesia consists of hundreds of distinct native ethnic and linguistic groups.
The largest – and politically dominant – ethnic group are the Javanese.
A shared identity has developed, defined by a national language, ethnic diversity, religious pluralism within a majority Muslim population, and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it.
Indonesia's national motto, ""Bhinneka Tunggal Ika"" ("Unity in Diversity" "literally," "many, yet one"), articulates the diversity that shapes the country.
Despite its large population and densely populated regions, Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world's second highest level of biodiversity.
The country has abundant natural resources, yet poverty remains widespread.
Which empire does Brazil have strong colonial ties with
The core culture of Brazil is derived from Portuguese culture, because of its strong colonial ties with the Portuguese empire.
Among other influences, the Portuguese introduced the Portuguese language, Roman Catholicism and colonial architectural styles.
The culture was, however, also strongly influenced by African, indigenous and non-Portuguese European cultures and traditions.Some aspects of Brazilian culture were influenced by the contributions of Italian, German and other European as well Japanese, Jewish and Arab immigrants who arrived in large numbers in the South and Southeast of Brazil.
The indigenous Amerindians influenced Brazil's language and cuisine; and the Africans influenced language, cuisine, music, dance and religion.Brazilian art has developed since the 16th century into different styles that range from Baroque (the dominant style in Brazil until the early 19th century) to Romanticism, Modernism, Expressionism, Cubism, Surrealism and Abstractionism.
Brazilian cinema dates back to the birth of the medium in the late 19th century and has gained a new level of international acclaim since the 1960s.
When was Pakistan's first fashion week held?
The shalwar kameez is the national dress of Pakistan and is worn by men and women in all four provinces Punjab, Sindh, Baluchistan, Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa and FATA in the country and in Azad Kashmir.
Each province has its own style of wearing the Shalwar Qameez.
Pakistanis wairclothes range from exquisite colors and designs to the type of fabric (silk, chiffon, cotton, etc.
).Pakistani fashion has flourished well in the changing environment of fashion world.
Since Pakistan came into being its fashion has been historically evolved from different phases and made its unique identity apart from Indian fashion and culture.
At this time, Pakistani fashion is a combination of traditional and modern dresses and it has become the cultural identification of Pakistan.
Despite of all modern trends, the regional and traditional dresses have developed their own significance as a symbol of native tradition.
This regional fashion is not static but evolving into more modern and pure forms.The Pakistan Fashion Design Council based in Lahore organizes "Fashion Week" and Fashion Pakistan based in Karachi organizes fashion shows in that city.
Pakistan’s first fashion week was held in November 2009.
How many are estimated dead from this civil war?
Civil war (1967-1970).The disequilibrium and perceived corruption of the electoral and political process led in 1966 to several back-to-back military coups.
The first was in January and led by a collection of young leftists under Major Emmanuel Ifeajuna and Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu.
It was partially successful; the coup plotters murdered Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Premier Ahmadu Bello of the Northern Region and Premier Ladoke Akintola of the Western Region.
Despite this, they could not set up a central government.
President Nwafor Orizu was then pressured to hand over government to the Nigeria Army, under the command of General JTU Aguyi-Ironsi.The coup was counter-acted by another successful plot, supported primarily by Northern military officers and Northerners who favoured the NPC, it was engineered by Northern officers, which allowed Lt Colonel Yakubu Gowon to become head of state.
This sequence of events led to an increase in ethnic tension and violence.
The Northern coup, motivated by ethnic and religious reasons, resulted in the deaths of many military officers and civilians, especially those of Igbo descent.The violence against the Igbo increased their desire for autonomy.
By May 1967, the Eastern Region voted to declare independence as a state called the Republic of Biafra, under the leadership of Lt Colonel Emeka Ojukwu.
The Nigerian Civil War began as the Nigerian (Western and Northern) side attacked Biafra (South-eastern) on 6 July 1967 at Garkem.
The 30 month war, with a long siege of Biafra and its isolation from trade and supplies, ended in January 1970.
Estimates of the number of dead in the former Eastern Region are between 1 and 3 million people, from warfare, disease, and starvation, during the 30-month civil war .France, Egypt, Soviet Union, Britain and others were deeply involved in the civil war behind the scenes.
Britain and the Soviet Union were the main military backers of the Nigerian government while France and others helped the Biafrans.
Nigeria also used Egyptian pilots for their air force.
What was introduced by Spanish conquerors unintentionally that led to the death of millions of Aztecs starting in the 1520s?
Conquest (1519).The Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire began in February 1519 when Hernán Cortés arrived at the port in Veracruz with ca.
500 conquistadores, and later moved on to the Aztec capital.
On his search for gold and other riches, Cortés decided to invade and conquer the Aztec empire.The ruler of the Aztec empire upon the arrival of the Spaniards was Moctezuma II, who was later killed; his successor and brother Cuitláhuac took control of the Aztec empire, but was among the first to fall from the smallpox epidemic a short time later.
Unintentionally introduced by Spanish conquerors, smallpox ravaged Mesoamerica in the 1520s, killing more than 3 million Aztecs.
Other sources, however, mentioned that the death toll of the Aztecs might have reached up to 15 million (out of a population of less than 30 million).
Severely weakened, the Aztec empire was easily defeated by Cortés and his forces on his second return.Smallpox was a devastating and selective disease—it generally killed Aztecs but not Spaniards, who as Europeans had already been exposed to it for centuries and were therefore much more immune to it.
The deaths caused by smallpox are believed to have triggered a rapid growth of Christianity in Mexico and the Americas.
At first, the Aztecs believed the epidemic was a punishment from an angry god, but they later accepted their fate and no longer resisted the Spanish rule.
Many of the surviving Aztecs blamed the cause of smallpox to the superiority of the Christian god, which resulted in the acceptance of Catholicism and yielding to the Spanish rule throughout Mexico.The territory became part of the Spanish Empire under the name of New Spain.
Mexico City was systematically rebuilt by Cortés following the Fall of Tenochtitlan in 1521.
Much of the identity, traditions and architecture of Mexico were created during the colonial period.
What percent of internation passenger traffic does Tan Son Nhat airport handle?
Vietnam operates 21 major civil airports, including three international gateways: Noi Bai in Hanoi, Da Nang International Airport in Da Nang, and Tan Son Nhat in Ho Chi Minh City.
Tan Son Nhat is the nation's largest airport, handling 75% of international passenger traffic.
According to a state-approved plan, Vietnam will have 10 international airports by 2015 – besides the aforementioned three, these include Lien Khuong International Airport, Phu Bai International Airport, Cam Ranh International Airport, Phu Quoc International Airport, Cat Bi International Airport, Cần Thơ International Airport and Long Thanh International Airport.
The planned Long Thanh International Airport will have an annual service capacity of 100 million passengers once it becomes fully operational in 2020.Vietnam Airlines, the state-owned national airline, maintains a fleet of 69 passenger aircraft, and aims to operate 150 by 2020.
Several private airlines are also in operation in Vietnam, including Air Mekong, Jetstar Pacific Airlines, VASCO and VietJet Air.
What are the two main styles of Egyptian belly dance?
Today, Egypt is often considered the home of belly dance.
Egyptian belly dance has two main styles - raqs baladi and raqs sharqi.
There are also numerous folkloric and character dances that may be part of an Egyptian-style belly dancer's repertoire, as well as the modern shaabi street dance which shares some elements with raqs baladi.Samia Gamal was the most famous dancer in Egypt.
What year did the Ottomans complete their conquest of the Byzantine Empire?
The "House of Seljuk" was a branch of the "Kınık" Oğuz Turks who resided on the periphery of the Muslim world, in the Yabghu Khaganate of the Oğuz confederacy, to the north of the Caspian and Aral Seas, in the 9th century.
In the 10th century, the Seljuks started migrating from their ancestral homeland into Persia, which became the administrative core of the Great Seljuk Empire.In the latter half of the 11th century, the Seljuks began penetrating into the eastern regions of Anatolia.
In 1071, the Seljuk Turks defeated the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert, starting Turkification of the area; the Turkish language and Islam were introduced to Anatolia and gradually spread over the region and the slow transition from a predominantly Christian and Greek-speaking Anatolia to a predominantly Muslim and Turkish-speaking one was underway.In 1243, the Seljuk armies were defeated by the Mongols, causing the Seljuk Empire's power to slowly disintegrate.
In its wake, one of the Turkish principalities governed by Osman I would, over the next 200 years, evolve into the Ottoman Empire, expanding throughout Anatolia, the Balkans, the Levant and North Africa.
In 1453, the Ottomans completed their conquest of the Byzantine Empire by capturing its capital, Constantinople.In 1514, Sultan Selim I (1512–1520) successfully expanded the Empire's southern and eastern borders by defeating Shah Ismail I of the Safavid dynasty in the Battle of Chaldiran.
In 1517, Selim I expanded Ottoman rule into Algeria and Egypt, and created a naval presence in the Red Sea.
Subsequently, a competition started between the Ottoman and Portuguese empires to become the dominant sea power in the Indian Ocean, with numerous naval battles in the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf.
The Portuguese presence in the Indian Ocean was perceived as a threat for the Ottoman monopoly over the ancient trading routes between East Asia and Western Europe (later collectively named the Silk Road).
This important monopoly was increasingly compromised following the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope by Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias in 1488, which had a considerable impact on the Ottoman economy.The Ottoman Empire's power and prestige peaked in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent.
The empire was often at odds with the Holy Roman Empire in its steady advance towards Central Europe through the Balkans and the southern part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.
At sea, the Ottoman Navy contended with several Holy Leagues (composed primarily of Habsburg Spain, the Republic of Genoa, the Republic of Venice, the Knights of St. John, the Papal States, the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the Duchy of Savoy) for control of the Mediterranean Sea.
In the east, the Ottomans were occasionally at war with Safavid Persia over conflicts stemming from territorial disputes or religious differences between the 16th and 18th centuries.From the beginning of the 19th century onwards, the Ottoman Empire began to decline.
As it gradually shrank in size, military power and wealth, many Balkan Muslims migrated to the Empire's heartland in Anatolia, along with the Circassians fleeing the Russian conquest of the Caucasus.
The decline of the Ottoman Empire led to a rise in nationalist sentiment among the various subject peoples, leading to increased ethnic tensions which occasionally burst into violence, such as the Hamidian massacres.The Ottoman Empire entered World War I on the side of the Central Powers and was ultimately defeated.
During the war, an estimated 1,500,000 Armenians were deported and exterminated in the Armenian Genocide.
The Turkish government denies that there was an Armenian Genocide and claims that Armenians were only relocated from the eastern war zone.
Large-scale massacres were also committed against the empire's other minority groups such as the Greeks and Assyrians.Following the Armistice of Mudros on 30 October 1918, the victorious Allied Powers sought to partition the Ottoman state through the 1920 Treaty of Sèvres.
Early German cinema was particularly influential with which German expressionists?
German cinema dates back to the earliest years of the medium, it has made major technical and artistic contributions to film, as with the work of Max Skladanowsky, who showed the first film sequences ever to an audience, in 1895.
Early German cinema was particularly influential with German expressionists such as Robert Wiene and Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau.
Director Fritz Lang's "Metropolis" (1927) is referred to as the first modern science-fiction film.
In 1930 Josef von Sternberg directed "The Blue Angel", the first major German sound film.During the 1970s and 1980s, New German Cinema directors such as Volker Schlöndorff, Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, and Rainer Werner Fassbinder put West German cinema on the international stage.
The annual European Film Awards ceremony is held every other year in Berlin, home of the European Film Academy (EFA); the Berlin Film Festival, held annually since 1951, is one of the world's foremost film festivals.In the 21st century, several German movies have had international success, such as "Nowhere in Africa" (2001), "Das Experiment" (2001), "Good Bye, Lenin!"

How long does a person have to serve full-time?
The Royal Thai Armed Forces ( constitute the military of the Kingdom of Thailand.
They consist of the Royal Thai Army (กองทัพบกไทย), the Royal Thai Navy (กองทัพเรือไทย), and the Royal Thai Air Force (กองทัพอากาศไทย).
It also incorporates various paramilitary forces.Currently, the Royal Thai Armed Forces has a combined manpower of about 800,000 personnel.
The Head of the Thai Armed Forces (จอมทัพไทย, "Chom Thap Thai") is King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX), although this position is only nominal.
The Armed Forces is managed by the Ministry of Defence of Thailand, which is headed by the Minister of Defence (a member of the Cabinet of Thailand) and commanded by the Royal Thai Armed Forces Headquarters, which in turn is headed by the Chief of Defence Forces of Thailand.
In 2011, Thailand's known military expenditure totalled approximately US$5.1 billion.According to the constitution, serving in the Armed Forces is a duty of all Thai citizens.
However, only males over the age of 21, who have not gone through reserve training of the Army Reserve Force Students, are given the option of whether they want to volunteer for the armed forces, or choose the random draft.
The candidates are subjected to varying lengths of training, from six months to two years of full-time service, depending on their education, whether they have partially completed the reserve training course, and whether they volunteered prior to the drafting date (usually 1 April every year).Candidates with a recognized bachelor's degree will be subjected to one year of full-time service if they chose the random draft, or six months if they volunteer at their respective district office (สัสดี, "satsadi").
Likewise, the training length is also reduced for those who have partially completed the three-year reserve training course (ร.ด., "ro do").
A person who completed one year out of three will only have to serve full-time for one year.
Those who completed two years of reserve training will only have to do six months of full-time training, while those who complete three years or more of reserve training will be exempted entirely.The Royal Thai Armed Forces Day is celebrated on 18 January, commemorating the victory of King Naresuan the Great in battle against the Crown Prince of Burma in 1593.
What did the first Italian film show?
The history of Italian cinema began a few months after the Lumière brothers began motion picture exhibitions.
The first Italian film was a few seconds, showing Pope Leo XIII giving a blessing to the camera.
The Italian film industry was born between 1903 and 1908 with three companies: the Società Italiana Cines, the Ambrosio Film and the Itala Film.
Other companies soon followed in Milan and in Naples.
In a short time these first companies reached a fair producing quality, and films were soon sold outside Italy.
Cinema was later used by Benito Mussolini, who founded Rome's renowned Cinecittà studio for the production of Fascist propaganda until World War II.After the war, Italian film was widely recognised and exported until an artistic decline around the 1980s.
Notable Italian film directors from this period include Vittorio De Sica, Federico Fellini, Sergio Leone, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Luchino Visconti, Michelangelo Antonioni and Dario Argento.
Movies include world cinema treasures such as "La dolce vita", "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" and "Bicycle Thieves".
The mid-1940s to the early 1950s was the heyday of neorealist films, reflecting the poor condition of post-war Italy.As the country grew wealthier in the 1950s, a form of neorealism known as pink neorealism succeeded, and other film genres, such as sword-and-sandal followed as spaghetti westerns, were popular in the 1960s and 1970s.
In recent years, the Italian scene has received only occasional international attention, with movies like "La vita è bella" directed by Roberto Benigni, "Il postino" with Massimo Troisi and "La grande bellezza" directed by Paolo Sorrentino
What are the characteristics of Canadian Aboriginal societies?
History.Aboriginal peoples.Archaeological studies and genetic analyses have indicated a human presence in the northern Yukon region from 24,500 BC, and in southern Ontario from 7500 BC.The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada.
The characteristics of Canadian Aboriginal societies included permanent settlements,agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks.
Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, and have only been discovered through archeological investigations.The aboriginal population at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000 and two million, with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada's Royal Commission on Aboriginal Health.
As a consequence of the European colonization, Canada's aboriginal peoples suffered from repeated outbreaks of newly introduced infectious diseases such as influenza, measles, and smallpox (to which they had no natural immunity), resulting in a forty- to eighty-percent population decrease in the centuries after the European arrival.Aboriginal peoples in present-day Canada include the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis.
The Métis are a mixed-blood people who originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations and Inuit people married European settlers.
In general, the Inuit had more limited interaction with European settlers during the colonization period.
In May 2009 what was the unemployment rate?
The adoption of the Euro saw a marked reduction in interest rates to historic lows.
The growth in the Spanish property market, which had begun in 1997, accelerated and within a few years had developed into a property bubble, financed largely by the cajas (regional savings banks under the oversight of the regional governments) and fed by the historically low interest rates and a massive growth of immigration.
The Spanish economy was credited for having avoided the virtual zero growth rate of some of its largest partners in the EU.
The country's economy created more than half of all the new jobs in the European Union over the five years ending 2005.
The bubble imploded in 2008, causing the collapse of Spain's large property related and construction sectors, causing mass layoffs, and a collapsing domestic demand for goods and services.
By the end of May 2009, unemployment reached 18.7% (37% for youths).At first, Spain's banks and financial services avoided the early crisis of their counterparts in the US and UK.
This was particularly the case with Spain's international banks, Banco Santander and BBVA, that had diversified, international portfolios and had actively limited their exposure to housing mortgage risk.
Banco Santander was able to profit from the global financial crisis by taking over distressed British banking firms.
However, as the recession deepened and property prices slid, the growing bad debts of the smaller regional savings banks, the cajas, forced the intervention of Spain's central bank and government through a stabilisation and consolidation program, taking over or consolidating regional cajas and finally receiving a bank bailout from the European Central Bank in 2012.
What date was A new Hobbit started?
Persuaded by his publishers, he started "a new Hobbit" in December 1937.
After several false starts, the story of the One Ring emerged.
The idea for the first chapter ("A Long-Expected Party") arrived fully formed, although the reasons behind Bilbo's disappearance, the significance of the Ring, and the title "The Lord of the Rings" did not arrive until the spring of 1938.
Originally, he planned to write a story in which Bilbo had used up all his treasure and was looking for another adventure to gain more; however, he remembered the Ring and its powers and thought that would be a better focus for the new work.
As the story progressed, he also brought in elements from 'The Silmarillion' mythology.Writing was slow, because Tolkien had a full-time academic position, and needed to earn further money as a university examiner.
Tolkien abandoned "The Lord of the Rings" during most of 1943 and only re-started it in April 1944, as a serial for his son Christopher Tolkien, who was sent chapters as they were written while he was serving in South Africa with the Royal Air Force.
Tolkien made another concerted effort in 1946, and showed the manuscript to his publishers in 1947.
The story was effectively finished the next year, but Tolkien did not complete the revision of earlier parts of the work until 1949.
The original manuscripts, which total 9,250 pages, now reside in the J.R.R.

Where did Art Director Douglas Rogers visit for inspiration for Shrek's swamp?
Production.Development.At the time DreamWorks was founded, producer John H. Williams got hold of the book from his children, and when he brought it to DreamWorks, it caught Jeffrey Katzenberg's attention and the studio decided to make it into a movie.
Recounting the inspiration of making the film, Williams said: After buying the rights to the film, Katzenberg quickly put the film in active development in November 1995.
Steven Spielberg had thought about making a traditionally animated film of the book before, when he bought the rights to the book in 1991, before the founding of DreamWorks, where Bill Murray would play Shrek and Steve Martin would play Donkey.
In the beginning of production, co-director Andrew Adamson refused to be intimidated by Katzenberg, and had an argument with him how much should the film appeal to adults.
Katzenberg wanted both audiences, but he found some of Adamson's ideas about adding sexual jokes and Guns N' Roses music to the soundtrack a bit too outrageous.
Andrew Adamson and Kelly Asbury joined in 1997 to co-direct the film.
However, Asbury left a year later for work on the 2002 film "", and was replaced with story artist Vicky Jenson.
Both Adamson and Jenson decided to work on the film in half, so the crew could at least know who to go to with specific detail questions about the film's sequences; "We both ended up doing a lot of everything", Adamson said.
"We're both kinda control freaks, and we both wanted to do everything.
"Some early sketches of Shrek's house were done in 1996 through 1997 using Photoshop, with the sketches showing Shrek first living in a garbage dump near a human village called Wart Creek.
It was also thought one time that he lived with his parents and kept rotting fish in his bedroom.
Donkey was modeled after "Pericles" (born 1994; also known as "Perry"), a real miniature donkey from Barron Park, Palo Alto, California.
Raman Hui, supervising animator of "Shrek", stated that Fiona "wasn't based on any real person."
and he did many different sketches for Princess Fiona and had done over 100 sculptures of Fiona before the directors picked the final design.
In early development, the Art Directors visited Hearst Castle, Stratford upon Avon and Dordogne for inspiration.
Art Director Douglas Rogers visited a magnolia plantation in Charleston, South Carolina for inspiration for Shrek's swamp.
Planned characters not used in the film include Goldilocks and Sleeping Beauty.
What was happening in the scene that was cut from the final edit?
It was difficult for crew members to perceive the film's quality during much of the production process, when the finished footage was in scattered pieces and lacked elements like music and sound design.
Some animators felt the film would be a significant disappointment commercially, but felt animators and animation fans would find it interesting.
According to Lee Unkrich, one of the original editors of "Toy Story", a scene was cut out of the original final edit.
The scene features Sid, after Pizza Planet, torturing Buzz and Woody violently.
Unkrich decided to cut right into the scene where Sid is interrogating the toys because the creators of the movie thought the audience would be loving Buzz and Woody at that point.
Another scene, where Woody was trying to get Buzz's attention when he was stuck in the box crate, was shortened because the creators felt it would lose the energy of the movie.
Peter Schneider had grown buoyant about the film as it neared completion, and announced a United States release date of November, coinciding with Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the winter holiday season.Sources indicate that executive producer Steve Jobs lacked confidence in the film during its production, and he had been talking to various companies, ranging from Hallmark to Microsoft, about selling Pixar.
However, as the film progressed, Jobs became ever more excited about it, feeling that he might be on the verge of transforming the movie industry.
As scenes from the movie were finished, he watched them repeatedly and had friends come by his home to share his new passion.
Jobs decided that the release of "Toy Story" that November would be the occasion to take Pixar public.
A test audience near Anaheim in late July 1995 indicated the need for last-minute tweaks, which added further pressure to the already frenetic final weeks.
Response cards from the audience were encouraging, but were not top of the scale, adding further question as to how audiences would respond.
The film ended with a shot of Andy's house and the sound of a new puppy.
Michael Eisner, who attended the screening, told Lasseter afterward that the film needed to end with a shot of Woody and Buzz together, reacting to the news of the puppy.
How many stars did Peter Howell award Kung Fu Panda?

Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 73 out of 100, based on 33 reviews.Richard Corliss of "Time Magazine" gave "Kung Fu Panda" a positive review, stating the picture "provides a master course in cunning visual art and ultra-satisfying entertainment".
"The New York Times" said, "At once fuzzy-wuzzy and industrial strength, the tacky-sounding "Kung Fu Panda" is high concept with a heart," and the review called the film "consistently diverting" and "visually arresting".
Chris Barsanti of "Filmcritic.com" commented, "Blazing across the screen with eye-popping, sublime artwork, "Kung Fu Panda" sets itself apart from the modern domestic animation trend with its sheer beauty [...] the film enters instant classic status as some of the most gorgeous animation Hollywood has produced since the golden age of Disney."
Michael Phillips of the "Chicago Tribune" called the film "one of the few comedies of 2008 in any style or genre that knows what it’s doing".
However, Tom Charity of CNN criticized the action for " to blur into a whirlwind of slapstick chaos" and considered the character of Po similar to others played by Black.
Peter Howell of "The Toronto Star" awarded the film two and a half stars, considering it to have a "lack of story" that "frequently manages to amuse, if not entirely to delight".
What illness caused Greene's death?
Darabont secured the film adaptation rights from author Stephen King after impressing the author with his short film adaptation of "The Woman in the Room" in 1983.
Although the two had become friends and maintained a pen-pal relationship, Darabont did not work with him until four years later in 1987, when he optioned to adapt "Shawshank".
This is one of the more famous Dollar Deals made by King with aspiring filmmakers.
Darabont later directed "The Green Mile" (1999), which was based on another work about a prison by Stephen King, and then followed that up with an adaptation of King's novella "The Mist".Rob Reiner, who had previously adapted another King novella, "The Body", into the film "Stand by Me" (1986), offered $2.5 million in an attempt to write and direct "Shawshank".
He planned to cast Tom Cruise in the part of Andy and Harrison Ford as Red.
Darabont seriously considered and liked Reiner's vision, but he ultimately decided it was his "chance to do something really great" by directing the film himself.Though the film is set in Maine, the Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio, served as the fictional Shawshank Prison.
Though a large portion of the prison was torn down after filming, the main administration building and two cell blocks remained; the site would be revisited later for filming parts of the film "Air Force One".
Several of the interior shots of the specialized prison facilities, such as the admittance rooms and the warden's office, were shot in the reformatory.
The interior of the boarding room used by Brooks and Red was located in the administration building, though exterior shots were made elsewhere.
The prison site is a tourist attraction.
Internal scenes in the prison cellblocks were actually filmed on a soundstage built inside the nearby shuttered Westinghouse factory.
Downtown scenes were also filmed in Mansfield, as well as neighboring Ashland, Ohio.
The oak tree under which Andy buries his letter to Red is located at , near Malabar Farm State Park, in Lucas, Ohio.
The tree was heavily damaged by straight-line winds in a thunderstorm on July 29, 2011; officials are unsure if the tree will survive.The film was dedicated to Allen Greene, an agent and a close personal friend of the film's director, Frank Darabont.
Greene died shortly before the film was released due to complications of HIV/AIDS.
In which year was 'The Godfather' the highest grossing film?
Reception.Box office performance.
"The Godfather" was a blockbuster, breaking many box office records to become the highest grossing film of 1972.
It earned $81.5 million in theatrical rentals in North America during its initial release, increasing its earnings to $85.7 million through a reissue in 1973, and including a limited re-release in 1997 it ultimately earned an equivalent exhibition gross of $135 million.
It displaced "Gone with the Wind" to claim the record as the top rentals earner, a position it would retain until the release of "Jaws" in 1975.
News articles at the time proclaimed it was the first film to gross $100 million in North America, but such accounts are erroneous since this record in fact belongs to "The Sound of Music", released in 1965.
The film repeated its native success overseas, earning in total an unprecedented $142 million in worldwide theatrical rentals, to become the highest net earner.
Profits were so high for "The Godfather" that earnings for Gulf & Western Industries, Inc., which owned Paramount Pictures, jumped from seventy-seven cents per share to three dollars and thirty cents a share for the year, according to a "Los Angeles Times" article, dated December 13, 1972.
To date, it has grossed between $245 and 286 million in international box office receipts, and adjusted for ticket price inflation in North America, ranks among the top 25 highest-grossing films.
In which year did the film "The Graduate" release in?
Fight Club is a 1999 American film based on the 1996 novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk.
The film was directed by David Fincher and stars Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter.
Norton plays the unnamed protagonist, an "everyman" who is discontented with his white-collar job.
He forms a "fight club" with soap maker Tyler Durden, played by Pitt, and they are joined by men who also want to fight recreationally.
The narrator becomes embroiled in a relationship with Durden and a dissolute woman, Marla Singer, played by Bonham Carter.Palahniuk's novel was optioned by 20th Century Fox producer Laura Ziskin, who hired Jim Uhls to write the film adaptation.
Fincher was one of four directors the producers considered.
They hired him because of his enthusiasm for the film.
Fincher developed the script with Uhls and sought screenwriting advice from the cast and others in the film industry.
The director and the cast compared the film to "Rebel Without a Cause" (1955) and "The Graduate" (1967).
Fincher intended "Fight Club"s violence to serve as a metaphor for the conflict between a generation of young people and the value system of advertising.
The director copied the homoerotic overtones from Palahniuk's novel to make audiences uncomfortable and keep them from anticipating the twist ending.Studio executives did not like the film and they restructured Fincher's intended marketing campaign to try to reduce anticipated losses.
"Fight Club" failed to meet the studio's expectations at the box office and received polarized reactions from critics.
It was cited as one of the most controversial and talked-about films of 1999.
However, the film over the years found critical and commercial success with its DVD release, which established "Fight Club" as a cult film.

Which production studio did the Wachowskis present their script for Assassins to?
Production.Development.In 1994, the Wachowskis presented the script for the film "Assassins" to Warner Brothers.
After Lorenzo di Bonaventura, the president of production of the company at the time, read the script, he decided to buy rights to it and included two more pictures, "Bound" and "The Matrix", in the contract.
The first movie the Wachowskis directed, "Bound", then became a critical success.
Using this momentum, the brothers later asked to direct "The Matrix".Producer Joel Silver soon joined the project.
Although the project had key supporters like Silver and Di Bonaventura to influence the company, "The Matrix" was still a huge investment for Warner Bros, which had to invest $60 million to create a movie with deep philosophical ideas and difficult special effects.
The Wachowskis therefore hired underground comic book artists Geof Darrow and Steve Skroce to draw a 600-page, shot-by-shot storyboard for the entire film.
The storyboard eventually earned the studio's approval, and it was decided to film in Australia to make the most of the budget.
Soon, "The Matrix" became a co-production of Warner Bros. and the Australian company Village Roadshow Pictures.

What score did Batman Begins receive on the website Rotten Tomatoes?
"Batman Begins" has received positive reviews from critics.
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 85% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 263 reviews, with an average score of 7.7/10, making the film a "Certified Fresh" on the website's rating system.
At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 70, based on 41 reviews, which indicates "generally favorable reviews".
Additionally, the film was a success with audiences who, when polled by CinemaScore, awarded the film an A grade.James Berardinelli applauded Nolan and Goyer's work creating more understanding into "who is and what motivates him", something Berardinelli felt Tim Burton's film lacked; at the same time, Berardinelli felt the romantic aspect between Bale and Holmes did not work because the actors lacked the chemistry Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder ("Superman"), or Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst ("Spider-Man") shared in their respective roles.
According to "Total Film", Nolan manages to create such strong characters and story that the third-act action sequences cannot compare to "the frisson of two people talking", and Katie Holmes and Christian Bale's romantic subplot has a spark "refreshingly free of Peter Parker/Mary Jane-style whining".
"Los Angeles Times" Kenneth Turan, who felt the film began slowly, stated that the "story, psychology and reality, not special effects", assisted the darkness behind Batman's arsenal; he noted that Neeson and Holmes, unlike Bale's ability to "feel his role in his bones", do not appear to fit their respective characters in "being both comic-book archetypes and real people".
"The New Yorker" David Denby did not share Berardinelli and Turan's opinion.
He was unimpressed with the film, when comparing it to the two Tim Burton films, and that Christian Bale's presence was hindered by the "dull earnestness of the screenplay", the final climax was "cheesy and unexciting", and that Nolan had resorted to imitating the "fakery" used by other filmmakers when filming action sequences.Michael Wilmington of the "Chicago Tribune" believed Nolan and Goyer managed to "comfortably mix the tormented drama and revenge motifs with light hearted gags and comic book allusions," and that Nolan takes the series out of the "slam-bang Hollywood jokefests" the franchise had drifted into.
Comic book scribe and editor Dennis O'Neil stated that he "felt the filmmakers really understood the character they were translating", citing this film as the best of the live-action "Batman" films.
In contrast, J.R. Jones, from the "Chicago Reader", criticized the script, and Nolan and David Goyer for not living up to the "hype about exploring Batman's damaged psyche".
Roger Ebert, who gave mixed reviews to the previous films, wrote this was "the "Batman" movie I've been waiting for; more correctly, this is the movie I did not realize I was waiting for".
Giving it four out of four stars, he commended the realistic portrayals of the Batman arsenal – the Batsuit, Batcave, Tumbler, and the Batsignal – as well as the focus on "the story and character" with less stress on "high-tech action".Like Berardinelli, "USA Today"s Mike Clark thought Bale performed the role of Batman as well as he did Patrick Bateman in "American Psycho", but that the relationship between Bruce Wayne and Rachel Dawes was "frustratingly underdeveloped".
Kyle Smith thought Bale exhibited "both the menace and the wit he showed in his brilliant turn in "American Psycho"", and that the film works so well because of the realism, stating, "Batman starts stripping away each layer of Gotham crime only to discover a sicker and more monstrous evil beneath, his rancid city simultaneously invokes early '90s New York, when criminals frolicked to the tune of five murders a day; "Serpico" New York, when cops were for sale; and today, when psychos seek to kill us all at once rather than one by one."
In contrast, Salon.com's Stephanie Zacharek felt Nolan did not deliver the emotional depth expected of "one of the most soulful and tortured superheroes of all"; she thought Bale, unlike Michael Keaton whom she compared him to, failed to connect with the audience underneath the mask, but that Gary Oldman succeeded in "emotional complexity" where the rest of the movie failed.Film director Tim Burton felt Nolan "captured the real spirit that these kind of movies are supposed to have nowadays.
When I did "Batman" twenty years ago, in 1988 or something, it was a different time in comic book movies.
You couldn't go into that dark side of comics yet.
The last couple of years that has become acceptable and Nolan certainly got more to the root of what the "Batman" comics are about."
What year was the Transcaucasian Federative Republic created?
In the late spring of 1918, three new states were formed in the South Caucasus: the First Republic of Armenia, the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Georgia, which declared their independence from the Russian Empire.
Two other minor entities were established, the Centrocaspian Dictatorship and South West Caucasian Republic (the former was liquidated by Azerbaijan in the autumn of 1918 and the latter by a joint Armenian-British task force in early 1919).
With the withdrawal of the Russian armies from the Caucasus front in the winter of 1917–18, the three major republics braced for an imminent Ottoman advance, which commenced in the early months of 1918.
Solidarity was briefly maintained when the Transcaucasian Federative Republic was created in the spring of 1918, but this collapsed in May, when the Georgians asked and received protection from Germany and the Azerbaijanis concluded a treaty with the Ottoman Empire that was more akin to a military alliance.
Armenia was left to fend for itself and struggled for five months against the threat of a full-fledged occupation by the Ottoman Turks.
What year were the Japanese defeated?
Pacific (1942–43).By the end of April 1942, Japan and its ally Thailand had almost fully conquered Burma, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, and Rabaul, inflicting severe losses on Allied troops and taking a large number of prisoners.
Despite stubborn resistance at Corregidor, the US possession of the Philippines was eventually captured in May 1942, forcing its government into exile.
On 16 April, in Burma 7,000 British soldiers were encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division during the Battle of Yenangyaung and rescued by the Chinese 38th Division.
Japanese forces also achieved naval victories in the South China Sea, Java Sea and Indian Ocean, and bombed the Allied naval base at Darwin, Australia.
The only real Allied success against Japan was a Chinese victory at Changsha in early January 1942.
These easy victories over unprepared opponents left Japan overconfident, as well as overextended.In early May 1942, Japan initiated operations to capture Port Moresby by amphibious assault and thus sever communications and supply lines between the United States and Australia.
The Allies, however, prevented the invasion by intercepting and defeating the Japanese naval forces in the Battle of the Coral Sea.
Japan's next plan, motivated by the earlier Doolittle Raid, was to seize Midway Atoll and lure American carriers into battle to be eliminated; as a diversion, Japan would also send forces to occupy the Aleutian Islands in Alaska.
In early June, Japan put its operations into action but the Americans, having broken Japanese naval codes in late May, were fully aware of the plans and force dispositions and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive victory at Midway over the Imperial Japanese Navy.With its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the Midway battle, Japan chose to focus on a belated attempt to capture Port Moresby by an overland campaign in the Territory of Papua.
The Americans planned a counter-attack against Japanese positions in the southern Solomon Islands, primarily Guadalcanal, as a first step towards capturing Rabaul, the main Japanese base in Southeast Asia.Both plans started in July, but by mid-September, the Battle for Guadalcanal took priority for the Japanese, and troops in New Guinea were ordered to withdraw from the Port Moresby area to the northern part of the island, where they faced Australian and United States troops in the Battle of Buna-Gona.
Guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with heavy commitments of troops and ships in the battle for Guadalcanal.
By the start of 1943, the Japanese were defeated on the island and withdrew their troops.
In Burma, Commonwealth forces mounted two operations.
The first, an offensive into the Arakan region in late 1942, went disastrously, forcing a retreat back to India by May 1943.
The second was the insertion of irregular forces behind Japanese front-lines in February which, by the end of April, had achieved mixed results.
What date was Abraham Lincoln's inauguration?
In March 1864, Ulysses S. Grant, the commanding general of all the Union's armies, decided to suspend the exchange of prisoners-of-war.
As harsh as it may have been on the prisoners of both sides, Grant realized the exchange was prolonging the war by returning soldiers to the outnumbered and manpower-starved South.
John Wilkes Booth, a Southerner and outspoken Confederate sympathizer, conceived a plan to kidnap President Lincoln and deliver him to the Confederate Army, to be held hostage until the North agreed to resume exchanging prisoners.
Booth recruited Samuel Arnold, George Atzerodt, David Herold, Michael O'Laughlen, Lewis Powell (also known as "Lewis Paine"), and John Surratt to help him.
Surratt's mother, Mary Surratt, left her tavern in Surrattsville, Maryland, and moved to a house in Washington, D.C., where Booth became a frequent visitor.In late 1860, Booth had been initiated in the pro-Confederate Knights of the Golden Circle in Baltimore.
He attended Lincoln's second inauguration on March 4, 1865, as the invited guest of his secret fiancée Lucy Hale, daughter of John P. Hale, soon to become United States Ambassador to Spain.
Booth afterwards wrote in his diary, "What an excellent chance I had, if I wished, to kill the President on Inauguration day!
"On March 17, 1865, Booth informed his conspirators that Lincoln would be attending a play, "Still Waters Run Deep", at Campbell Military Hospital.
He assembled his men in a restaurant at the edge of town, intending that they should soon join him on a nearby stretch of road in order to capture the President on his way back from the hospital.
But Booth found out that Lincoln had not gone to the play after all.
Instead, he had attended a ceremony at the National Hotel in which officers of the 142nd Indiana Infantry presented Governor Oliver Morton with a captured Confederate battle flag.
Booth was living at the National Hotel at the time and could have had an opportunity to kill Lincoln had Booth not been at the hospital.Meanwhile, the Confederacy was falling apart.
On April 3, Richmond, Virginia, the Confederate capital, fell to the Union army.
On April 9, the Army of Northern Virginia, the main army of the Confederacy, surrendered to the Army of the Potomac at Appomattox Court House.
Confederate President Jefferson Davis and the rest of his government were in full flight.
Despite many Southerners giving up hope, Booth continued to believe in his cause.On April 11, 1865, two days after Lee's army surrendered to Grant, Booth attended a speech at the White House in which Lincoln supported the idea of enfranchising the former slaves.
Furiously provoked, Booth decided on assassination and is quoted as saying:That means 
How many parts did the Louisiana territory encompass of?
The Louisiana Purchase ( "Sale of Louisiana") was the acquisition by the United States of America in 1803 of of France's claim to the territory of Louisiana.
The U.S. paid 50 million francs ($11,250,000) plus cancellation of debts worth 18 million francs ($3,750,000), for a total sum of 15 million dollars (around 4 cents per acre) for the Louisiana territory ($ million in dollars, less than 42 cents per acre).
The Louisiana territory encompassed all or part of 15 present U.S. states and two Canadian provinces.
The land purchased contained all of present-day Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska; parts of Minnesota that were west of the Mississippi River; most of North Dakota; most of South Dakota; northeastern New Mexico; northern Texas; the portions of Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado east of the Continental Divide; Louisiana west of the Mississippi River, including the city of New Orleans; and small portions of land that would eventually become part of the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.France controlled this vast area from 1699 until 1762, the year it gave the territory to its ally Spain.
Under Napoleon Bonaparte, France took back the territory in 1800 in the hope of building an empire in North America.
A slave revolt in Haiti and an impending war with Britain, however, led France to abandon these plans and sell the entire territory to the United States, which had originally intended only to seek the purchase of New Orleans and its adjacent lands.The purchase of the territory of Louisiana took place during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson.
At the time, the purchase faced domestic opposition because it was thought to be unconstitutional.
Although he agreed that the U.S. Constitution did not contain provisions for acquiring territory, Jefferson decided to go ahead with the purchase anyway in order to remove France's presence in the region and to protect both U.S. trade access to the port of New Orleans and free passage on the Mississippi River.
Which substance does uranium-238 decay into first?
The second line of development pursued by the Manhattan Project used the fissile element plutonium.
Although small amounts of plutonium exist in nature, the best way to obtain large quantities of the element is in a nuclear reactor, in which natural uranium is bombarded by neutrons.
The uranium-238 is transmuted into uranium-239, which rapidly decays, first into neptunium-239 and then into plutonium-239.
Only a small amount of the uranium-238 will be transformed, so the plutonium must be chemically separated from the remaining uranium, from any initial impurities, and from fission products.
How many pilots were reported to have served in 1968?
As a result of a decision of the Korean Workers' Party in October 1966, in early 1967 North Korea sent a fighter squadron to North Vietnam to back up the North Vietnamese 921st and 923rd fighter squadrons defending Hanoi.
They stayed through 1968, and 200 pilots were reported to have served.In addition, at least two anti-aircraft artillery regiments were sent as well.
North Korea also sent weapons, ammunition and two million sets of uniforms to their comrades in North Vietnam.
Kim Il-sung is reported to have told his pilots to "fight in the war as if the Vietnamese sky were their own".
Which NASA Chief of Public Information provided commentary for the televised mission highlights?
Mission highlights.Launch and flight to lunar orbit.In addition to throngs of people crowding highways and beaches near the launch site, millions watched the event on television, with NASA Chief of Public Information Jack King providing commentary.
President Richard M. Nixon viewed the proceedings from the Oval Office of the White House.A Saturn V launched Apollo 11 from Launch Pad 39A, part of the Launch Complex 39 site at the Kennedy Space Center on July 16, 1969 at 13:32:00 UTC (9:32:00 a.m. EDT local time).
It entered orbit twelve minutes later.
After one and a half orbits, the S-IVB third-stage engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon with the Trans-Lunar Injection (TLI) burn at 16:22:13 UTC.
About 30 minutes later the command/service module pair separated from this last remaining Saturn V stage and docked with the Lunar Module still nestled in the Lunar Module Adaptor.
After the Lunar Module was extracted, the combined spacecraft headed for the Moon, while the third stage booster flew on a trajectory past the Moon and into heliocentric orbit.On July 19 at 17:21:50 UTC, Apollo 11 passed behind the Moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit.
In the thirty orbits that followed, the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern Sea of Tranquility (Mare Tranquillitatis) about southwest of the crater Sabine D (0.67408N, 23.47297E).
The landing site was selected in part because it had been characterized as relatively flat and smooth by the automated "Ranger 8" and "Surveyor 5" landers along with the "Lunar Orbiter" mapping spacecraft and unlikely to present major landing or extra-vehicular activity (EVA) challenges.
In what year did France set up an aid program for Americans?
Other participants.France.In early 1776, France set up a major program of aid to the Americans, and the Spanish secretly added funds.
Each country spent one million "livres tournaises" to buy munitions.
A dummy corporation run by Pierre Beaumarchais concealed their activities.
American rebels obtained some munitions through the Dutch Republic as well as French and Spanish ports in the West Indies.
When did the Wright brothers make the famous flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina?
Airplane inventors Wilbur and Orville Wright are famed for making the first controlled, powered, heavier-than-air flights on 17 December 1903 at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.
Lesser-known are other flights of theirs which played an important role at the dawn of aviation history.
In 1909 Wilbur was invited by the Hudson-Fulton Celebration Committee to make paid exhibition flights to help mark 300 years of New York history, including Henry Hudson discovering Manhattan and Robert Fulton starting a successful commercial steamboat service on the Hudson River.
The committee wanted the Wrights to demonstrate flights over the water around New York City.
Orville was making flights for customers in Germany, so Wilbur, who had just finished training U.S. Army pilots, accepted the job.
What year was the Brest Bible published?
In the first half of the 16th century, the enormous Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was a country of many creeds, but Roman Catholic Church remained the dominating religion.
Reformation reached Poland in the 1520s, and quickly gained popularity among mostly German-speaking inhabitants of such major cities, as Gdańsk, Toruń and Elbląg.
In Koenigsberg, in 1530, Polish-language edition of Luther's Small Catechism was published.
The Duchy of Prussia, which was a Polish fief, emerged as key center of the movement, with numerous publishing houses issuing not only Bibles, but also catechisms, in German, Polish and Lithuanian.Lutheranism gained popularity in northern part of the country, while Calvinism caught the interest of szlachta, mainly in Lesser Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.
Several publishing houses were opened in Lesser Poland in mid-16th century, in such locations, as Słomniki and Raków.
At that time, Mennonites and Czech Brothers came to Poland, with the latter ones settling mostly in Greater Poland, around Leszno.
In 1565, Polish Brethren appeared as yet another reformation movement.The 16th century Commonwealth was unique in Europe, because of widespread tolerance, confirmed by the Warsaw Confederation.
In 1563, the Brest Bible was published (see also Bible translations into Polish).
The period of tolerance ended during the reign of King Sigismund III Vasa, who was under strong influence of Piotr Skarga and other Jesuits.
After the Deluge, and other wars of the mid-17th century, in which all enemies of Poland were either Protestant or Orthodox Christians, the attitude of Poles changed.
Counter-Reformation prevailed, in 1658 Polish Brethren were forced to leave the country, and in 1666, the Sejm banned apostasy from Catholicism to any other religion, under punishment of death.
Finally, in 1717, the Silent Sejm banned non-Catholics from becoming deputies of the Parliament.Among most important Protestants of the Commonwealth, there are such names, as Mikołaj Rej, Marcin Czechowic, Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski and Symon Budny.
In which year did the Tea Party celebrate it's 200th anniversary?
John Adams and many other Americans considered tea drinking to be unpatriotic following the Boston Tea Party.
Tea drinking declined during and after the Revolution, resulting in a lasting American preference for coffee.According to historian Alfred Young, the term "Boston Tea Party" did not appear in print until 1834.
Before that time, the event was usually referred to as the "destruction of the tea".
According to Young, American writers were for many years apparently reluctant to celebrate the destruction of property, and so the event was usually ignored in histories of the American Revolution.
This began to change in the 1830s, however, especially with the publication of biographies of George Robert Twelves Hewes, one of the few still-living participants of the "tea party", as it then became known.The Boston Tea Party Museum is located on the Congress Street Bridge in Boston.
It features reenactments, a documentary, and a number of interactive exhibits.
The museum features two authentically restored ships, the Eleanor and the Beaver.
Additionally, the museum possesses one of two known tea chests from the original event, part of its permanent collection.
The issue was never the tax but how the tax was passed without American input; United States Congress taxed tea from 1789 to 1872.The Boston Tea Party has often been referenced in other political protests.
When Mohandas K. Gandhi led a mass burning of Indian registration cards in South Africa in 1908, a British newspaper compared the event to the Boston Tea Party.
When Gandhi met with the British viceroy in 1930 after the Indian salt protest campaign, Gandhi took some duty-free salt from his shawl and said, with a smile, that the salt was "to remind us of the famous Boston Tea Party.
"American activists from a variety of political viewpoints have invoked the Tea Party as a symbol of protest.
In 1973, on the 200th anniversary of the Tea Party, a mass meeting at Faneuil Hall called for the impeachment of President Richard Nixon and protested oil companies in the ongoing oil crisis.
Afterwards, protesters boarded a replica ship in Boston Harbor, hanged Nixon in effigy, and dumped several empty oil drums into the harbor.
In 1998, two conservative US Congressmen put the federal tax code into a chest marked "tea" and dumped it into the harbor.In 2006, a libertarian political party called the "Boston Tea Party" was founded.
In 2007, the Ron Paul "Tea Party" money bomb, held on the 234th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party, broke the one-day fund-raising record by raising $6.04 million in 24 hours.
Subsequently, these fund-raising "Tea parties" grew into the Tea Party movement, which dominated politics for the next two years, culminating in a voter victory for the Republicans in 2010 who were widely elected to seats in the United States House of Representatives.
What were the main modes of getting coal to rivers for shipment?
At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, inland transport was by navigable rivers and roads, with coastal vessels employed to move heavy goods by sea.
Railways or wagon ways were used for conveying coal to rivers for further shipment, but canals had not yet been constructed.
Animals supplied all of the motive power on land, with sails providing the motive power on the sea.The Industrial Revolution improved Britain's transport infrastructure with a turnpike road network, a canal and waterway network, and a railway network.
Raw materials and finished products could be moved more quickly and cheaply than before.
Improved transportation also allowed new ideas to spread quickly.
What was the most prominent negative result of deficit spending?
The Great Depression did not strongly affect Japan.
The Japanese economy shrank by 8% during 1929–31.
Japan's Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo was the first to implement what have come to be identified as Keynesian economic policies: first, by large fiscal stimulus involving deficit spending; and second, by devaluing the currency.
Takahashi used the Bank of Japan to sterilize the deficit spending and minimize resulting inflationary pressures.
Econometric studies have identified the fiscal stimulus as especially effective.The devaluation of the currency had an immediate effect.
Japanese textiles began to displace British textiles in export markets.
The deficit spending proved to be most profound.
The deficit spending went into the purchase of munitions for the armed forces.
By 1933, Japan was already out of the depression.
By 1934, Takahashi realized that the economy was in danger of overheating, and to avoid inflation, moved to reduce the deficit spending that went towards armaments and munitions.This resulted in a strong and swift negative reaction from nationalists, especially those in the army, culminating in his assassination in the course of the February 26 Incident.
This had a chilling effect on all civilian bureaucrats in the Japanese government.
From 1934, the military's dominance of the government continued to grow.
Instead of reducing deficit spending, the government introduced price controls and rationing schemes that reduced, but did not eliminate inflation, which would remain a problem until the end of World War II.The deficit spending had a transformative effect on Japan.
Japan's industrial production doubled during the 1930s.
Further, in 1929 the list of the largest firms in Japan was dominated by light industries, especially textile companies (many of Japan's automakers, like Toyota, have their roots in the textile industry).
By 1940 light industry had been displaced by heavy industry as the largest firms inside the Japanese economy.
In what year did the Liberation Army defeat the KMT?
In 1949, Mao Zedong's People's Liberation Army defeated Chiang Kai-shek's United States-backed Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalist Government in China, and the Soviet Union promptly created an alliance with the newly formed People's Republic of China.
According to Norwegian historian Odd Arne Westad, the Communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang Kai-Shek, and because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China.
Moreover, his party was weakened in the war against Japanese.
Meanwhile the Communists told different groups, such as peasants, exactly what they wanted to hear, and cloaked themselves in the cover of Chinese nationalism.Chiang and his KMT government retreated to the island of Taiwan.
Confronted with the communist revolution in China and the end of the American atomic monopoly in 1949, the Truman administration quickly moved to escalate and expand the containment policy.
In NSC-68, a secret 1950 document, the National Security Council proposed to reinforce pro-Western alliance systems and quadruple spending on defense.United States officials moved thereafter to expand containment into Asia, Africa, and Latin America, in order to counter revolutionary nationalist movements, often led by communist parties financed by the USSR, fighting against the restoration of Europe's colonial empires in South-East Asia and elsewhere.
In the early 1950s (a period sometimes known as the "Pactomania"), the US formalized a series of alliances with Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and the Philippines (notably ANZUS in 1951 and SEATO in 1954), thereby guaranteeing the United States a number of long-term military bases.
How many Jehovah's Witnesses were killed?
Refusing to pledge allegiance to the Nazi party or to serve in the military, roughly 12,000 Jehovah's Witnesses were forced to wear a purple triangle and were placed in camps where they were given the option of renouncing their faith and submitting to the state's authority.
Between 2,500 and 5,000 were killed.
Historian Detlef Garbe, director at the Neuengamme (Hamburg) Memorial, writes that "no other religious movement resisted the pressure to conform to National Socialism with comparable unanimity and steadfastness."
What year was the German Peace Treaty signed?
After the Versailles conference Wilson claimed that "at last the world knows America as the savior of the world!
"The Republican Party—led by Henry Cabot Lodge—controlled the U.S. Senate after the election of 1918, but the Senators were divided into multiple positions on the Versailles question.
It proved possible to build a majority coalition, but impossible to build a two-thirds coalition that was needed to pass a treaty.An angry bloc of 12–18 "Irreconcilables", mostly Republicans but also representatives of the Irish and German Democrats, fiercely opposed the Treaty.
One block of Democrats strongly supported the Versailles Treaty, even with reservations added by Lodge.
A second group of Democrats supported the Treaty but followed Wilson in opposing any amendments or reservations.
The largest bloc—led by Senator Lodge— comprised a majority of the Republicans.
They wanted a treaty with reservations, especially on Article X, which involved the power of the League of Nations to make war without a vote by the U.S. Congress.
All of the Irreconcilables were bitter enemies of President Wilson, and he launched a nationwide speaking tour in the summer of 1919 to refute them.
However, Wilson collapsed midway with a serious stroke that effectively ruined his leadership skills.The closest the Treaty came to passage was on November 19, 1919, as Lodge and his Republicans formed a coalition with the pro-Treaty Democrats, and were close to a two-thirds majority for a Treaty with reservations, but Wilson rejected this compromise and enough Democrats followed his lead to permanently end the chances for ratification.Among the American public as a whole, the Irish Catholics and the German Americans were intensely opposed to the Treaty, saying it favored the British.After Wilson's successor Warren G. Harding continued American opposition to the League of Nations, Congress passed the Knox–Porter Resolution bringing a formal end to hostilities between the U.S. and the Central Powers.
It was signed into law by Harding on July 21, 1921.The U.S.–German Peace Treaty of 1921 was signed in Berlin on , the US–Austrian Peace Treaty of 1921 was signed in Vienna on , and the US–Hungarian Peace Treaty of 1921 was signed in Budapest on .
What is an area that extends in all directions from a plant called?
An area originally extending in all directions from the plant is officially called the "zone of alienation".
It is largely uninhabited, except for about 300 residents who have refused to leave.
The area has largely reverted to forest, and has been overrun by wildlife because of a lack of competition with humans for space and resources.
Even today, radiation levels are so high that the workers responsible for rebuilding the sarcophagus are only allowed to work five hours a day for one month before taking 15 days of rest.
Ukrainian officials estimate the area will not be safe for human life again for another 20,000 years.In 2011 Ukraine opened up the sealed zone around the Chernobyl reactor to tourists who wish to learn more about the tragedy that occurred in 1986.
The X Corps landed at Wonsan and this town in northeast North Korea
UN forces cross partition line (September – October 1950).On 27 September, MacArthur received the top secret National Security Council Memorandum 81/1 from Truman reminding him that operations north of the 38th parallel were authorized only if "at the time of such operation there was no entry into North Korea by major Soviet or Chinese Communist forces, no announcements of intended entry, nor a threat to counter our operations militarily..." On 29 September MacArthur restored the government of the Republic of Korea under Syngman Rhee.
On 30 September, Defense Secretary George Marshall sent an eyes-only message to MacArthur: "We want you to feel unhampered tactically and strategically to proceed north of the 38th parallel."
During October, the ROK police executed people who were suspected to be sympathetic to North Korea, and similar massacres were carried out until early 1951.On 30 September, Zhou Enlai warned the U.S. that China was prepared to intervene in Korea if the U.S. crossed the 38th parallel.
Zhou attempted to advise North Korean commanders on how to conduct a general withdrawal by using the same tactics which had allowed Chinese communist forces to successfully escape Chiang Kai-shek's Encirclement Campaigns in the 1930s, but by some accounts North Korean commanders did not utilize these tactics effectively.
Bruce Cumings argues, however, the KPA's rapid withdrawal was strategic, with troops melting into the mountains from where they could launch guerrilla raids on the UN forces spread out on the coasts.By 1 October 1950, the UN Command repelled the KPA northwards past the 38th parallel; the ROK Army crossed after them, into North Korea.
MacArthur made a statement demanding the KPA's unconditional surrender.
Six days later, on 7 October, with UN authorization, the UN Command forces followed the ROK forces northwards.
The X Corps landed at Wonsan (in southeastern North Korea) and Riwon (in northeastern North Korea), already captured by ROK forces.
The Eighth U.S. Army and the ROK Army drove up western Korea and captured Pyongyang city, the North Korean capital, on 19 October 1950.
The 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team ("Rakkasans") made their first of two combat jumps during the Korean War on 20 October 1950 at Sunchon and Sukchon.
The missions of the 187th were to cut the road north going to China, preventing North Korean leaders from escaping from Pyongyang; and to rescue American prisoners of war.
At month's end, UN forces held 135,000 KPA prisoners of war.Taking advantage of the UN Command's strategic momentum against the communists, General MacArthur believed it necessary to extend the Korean War into China to destroy depots supplying the North Korean war effort.
President Truman disagreed, and ordered caution at the Sino-Korean border.
What year was Sergei Korolev arrested?
The German rocket center in Peenemünde was located in the eastern part of Germany, which became the Soviet zone of occupation.
On Stalin's orders, the Soviet Union sent its best rocket engineers to this region to see what they could salvage for future weapons systems.
The Soviet rocket engineers were led by Sergei Korolev.
He had been involved in space clubs and early Soviet rocket design in the 1930s, but was arrested in 1938 during Joseph Stalin's Great Purge and imprisoned for six years in Siberia.
After the war, he became the USSR's chief rocket and spacecraft engineer, essentially the Soviet counterpart to von Braun.
His identity was kept a state secret throughout the Cold War, and he was identified publicly only as "the Chief Designer."
In the West, his name was only officially revealed when he died in 1966.After almost a year in the area around Peenemünde, Soviet officials moved most of the captured German rocket specialists to Gorodomlya Island on Lake Seliger, about northwest of Moscow.
They were not allowed to participate in Soviet missile design, but were used as problem-solving consultants to the Soviet engineers.
They helped in the following areas: the creation of a Soviet version of the A-4; work on "organizational schemes"; research in improving the A-4 main engine; development of a 100-ton engine; assistance in the "layout" of plant production rooms; and preparation of rocket assembly using German components.
With their help, particularly Helmut Groettrup's group, Korolev reverse-engineered the A-4 and built his own version of the rocket, the R-1, in 1948.
Later, he developed his own distinct designs, though many of these designs were influenced by the Groettrup Group's G4-R10 design from 1949.
The Germans were eventually repatriated in 1951–53.In America, Von Braun and his team were sent to the United States Army's White Sands Proving Ground, located in New Mexico, in 1945.
They set about assembling the captured V2s and began a program of launching them and instructing American engineers in their operation.
These tests led to the first rocket to take photos from outer space, and the first two-stage rocket, the WAC Corporal-V2 combination, in 1949.
The German rocket team was moved from Fort Bliss to the Army's new Redstone Arsenal, located in Huntsville, Alabama, in 1950.
From here, Von Braun and his team would develop the Army's first operational medium-range ballistic missile, the Redstone rocket, that would, in slightly modified versions, launch both America's first satellite, and the first piloted Mercury space missions.
It became the basis for both the Jupiter and Saturn family of rockets.
What is the field of genetics that compares the phylogeny of DNA?
Because DNA collects mutations over time, which are then inherited, it contains historical information, and, by comparing DNA sequences, geneticists can infer the evolutionary history of organisms, their phylogeny.
This field of phylogenetics is a powerful tool in evolutionary biology.
If DNA sequences within a species are compared, population geneticists can learn the history of particular populations.
This can be used in studies ranging from ecological genetics to anthropology; For example, DNA evidence is being used to try to identify the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.DNA has also been used to look at modern family relationships, such as establishing family relationships between the descendants of Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson.
This usage is closely related to the use of DNA in criminal investigations detailed above.
Indeed, some criminal investigations have been solved when DNA from crime scenes has matched relatives of the guilty individual.
The depths of oceans have a lag time in changing tempature True or False?
External forcing mechanisms.Orbital variations.Slight variations in Earth's orbit lead to changes in the seasonal distribution of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface and how it is distributed across the globe.
There is very little change to the area-averaged annually averaged sunshine; but there can be strong changes in the geographical and seasonal distribution.
The three types of orbital variations are variations in Earth's eccentricity, changes in the tilt angle of Earth's axis of rotation, and precession of Earth's axis.
Combined together, these produce Milankovitch cycles which have a large impact on climate and are notable for their correlation to glacial and interglacial periods, their correlation with the advance and retreat of the Sahara, and for their appearance in the stratigraphic record.The IPCC notes that Milankovitch cycles drove the ice age cycles, CO2 followed temperature change "with a lag of some hundreds of years," and that as a feedback amplified temperature change.
The depths of the ocean have a lag time in changing temperature (thermal inertia on such scale).
Upon seawater temperature change, the solubility of CO2 in the oceans changed, as well as other factors impacting air-sea CO2 exchange.
What is a main identifier of stem cells?
In practice, stem cells are identified by whether they can regenerate tissue.
For example, the defining test for bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is the ability to transplant the cells and save an individual without HSCs.
This demonstrates that the cells can produce new blood cells over a long term.
It should also be possible to isolate stem cells from the transplanted individual, which can themselves be transplanted into another individual without HSCs, demonstrating that the stem cell was able to self-renew.Properties of stem cells can be illustrated "in vitro", using methods such as clonogenic assays, in which single cells are assessed for their ability to differentiate and self-renew.
Stem cells can also be isolated by their possession of a distinctive set of cell surface markers.
However, "in vitro" culture conditions can alter the behavior of cells, making it unclear whether the cells will behave in a similar manner "in vivo".
There is considerable debate as to whether some proposed adult cell populations are truly stem cells.
What does the ethics of cloning refer to in bioethics?
In bioethics, the ethics of cloning' refers to a variety of ethical positions regarding the practice and possibilities of cloning, especially human cloning.
While many of these views are religious in origin, the questions raised by cloning are faced by secular perspectives as well.
Perspectives on human cloning are theoretical, as human therapeutic and reproductive cloning are not commercially used; animals are currently cloned in laboratories and in livestock production.Advocates support development of therapeutic cloning in order to generate tissues and whole organs to treat patients who otherwise cannot obtain transplants, to avoid the need for immunosuppressive drugs, and to stave off the effects of aging.
Advocates for reproductive cloning believe that parents who cannot otherwise procreate should have access to the technology.Opponents of cloning have concerns that technology is not yet developed enough to be safe, that it could be prone to abuse (leading to the generation of humans from whom organs and tissues would be harvested), and have concerns about how cloned individuals could integrate with families and with society at large.Religious groups are divided, with some opposing the technology as usurping God's place and, to the extent embryos are used, destroying a human life; others support therapeutic cloning's potential life-saving benefits.Cloning of animals is opposed by animal-groups due to the number of cloned animals that suffer from malformations before they die, and while food from cloned animals has been approved by the US FDA, its use is opposed by groups concerned about food safety.
In 2010, how many UK respondents to the poll claimed to be fairly convinced of climate change?
Researchers at the University of Michigan have found that the public's belief as to the causes of global warming depends on the wording choice used in the polls.In 2007–2008 Gallup Polls surveyed 127 countries.
Over a third of the world's population was unaware of global warming, with people in developing countries less aware than those in developed, and those in Africa the least aware.
Of those aware, Latin America leads in belief that temperature changes are a result of human activities while Africa, parts of Asia and the Middle East, and a few countries from the Former Soviet Union lead in the opposite belief.
There is a significant contrast of the opinions of the concept and the appropriate response between Europe and the United States.
Nick Pidgeon of Cardiff University said that "results show the different stages of engagement about global warming on each side of the Atlantic", adding, "The debate in Europe is about what action needs to be taken, while many in the US still debate whether climate change is happening."
A 2010 poll by the Office of National Statistics found that 75% of UK respondents were at least "fairly convinced" that the world's climate is changing, compared to 87% in a similar survey in 2006.
A January 2011 ICM poll in the UK found 83% of respondents viewed climate change as a current or imminent threat, while 14% said it was no threat.
Opinion was unchanged from an August 2009 poll asking the same question, though there had been a slight polarisation of opposing views.By 2010, with 111 countries surveyed, Gallup determined that there was a substantial decrease in the number of Americans and Europeans who viewed global warming as a serious threat.
In the US, a little over half the population (53%) now viewed it as a serious concern for either themselves or their families; this was 10% below the 2008 poll (63%).
Latin America had the biggest rise in concern, with 73% saying global warming was a serious threat to their families.
That global poll also found that people are more likely to attribute global warming to human activities than to natural causes, except in the USA where nearly half (47%) of the population attributed global warming to natural causes.A March–May 2013 survey by Pew Research Center for the People & the Press polled 39 countries about global threats.
According to 54% of those questioned, global warming featured top of the perceived global threats.
In a January 2013 survey, Pew found that 69% of Americans say there is solid evidence that the Earth's average temperature has been getting warmer over the past few decades, up six points since November 2011 and 12 points since 2009.
What causes an element to have an increased metallic character?
The lower the values of ionization energy, electronegativity and electron affinity, the more metallic character the element has.
Conversely, nonmetallic character increases with higher values of these properties.
Given the periodic trends of these three properties, metallic character tends to decrease going across a period (or row) and, with some irregularities (mostly) due to poor screening of the nucleus by d and f electrons, and relativistic effects, tends to increase going down a group (or column or family).
Thus, the most metallic elements (such as caesium and francium) are found at the bottom left of traditional periodic tables and the most nonmetallic elements (oxygen, fluorine, chlorine) at the top right.
The combination of horizontal and vertical trends in metallic character explains the stair-shaped dividing line between metals and nonmetals found on some periodic tables, and the practice of sometimes categorizing several elements adjacent to that line, or elements adjacent to those elements, as metalloids.
Which famous inventor coined the theory of relativity?
Astrophysics and astronomy are the application of the theories and methods of physics to the study of stellar structure, stellar evolution, the origin of the solar system, and related problems of cosmology.
Because astrophysics is a broad subject, astrophysicists typically apply many disciplines of physics, including mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and molecular physics.The discovery by Karl Jansky in 1931 that radio signals were emitted by celestial bodies initiated the science of radio astronomy.
Most recently, the frontiers of astronomy have been expanded by space exploration.
Perturbations and interference from the earth's atmosphere make space-based observations necessary for infrared, ultraviolet, gamma-ray, and X-ray astronomy.Physical cosmology is the study of the formation and evolution of the universe on its largest scales.
Albert Einstein's theory of relativity plays a central role in all modern cosmological theories.
In the early 20th century, Hubble's discovery that the universe is expanding, as shown by the Hubble diagram, prompted rival explanations known as the steady state universe and the Big Bang.The Big Bang was confirmed by the success of Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the discovery of the cosmic microwave background in 1964.
The Big Bang model rests on two theoretical pillars: Albert Einstein's general relativity and the cosmological principle.
Cosmologists have recently established the ΛCDM model of the evolution of the universe, which includes cosmic inflation, dark energy, and dark matter.Numerous possibilities and discoveries are anticipated to emerge from new data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope over the upcoming decade and vastly revise or clarify existing models of the universe.
In particular, the potential for a tremendous discovery surrounding dark matter is possible over the next several years.
Fermi will search for evidence that dark matter is composed of weakly interacting massive particles, complementing similar experiments with the Large Hadron Collider and other underground detectors.IBEX is already yielding new astrophysical discoveries: "No one knows what is creating the ENA (energetic neutral atoms) ribbon" along the termination shock of the solar wind, "but everyone agrees that it means the textbook picture of the heliosphere — in which the solar system's enveloping pocket filled with the solar wind's charged particles is plowing through the onrushing 'galactic wind' of the interstellar medium in the shape of a comet — is wrong."
The survival of a living organsm depends non what?
The survival of a living organism depends on the continuous input of energy.
Chemical reactions that are responsible for its structure and function are tuned to extract energy from substances that act as its food and transform them to help form new cells and sustain them.
In this process, molecules of chemical substances that constitute food play two roles; first, they contain energy that can be transformed for biological chemical reactions; second, they develop new molecular structures made up of biomolecules.The organisms responsible for the introduction of energy into an ecosystem are known as producers or autotrophs.
Nearly all of these organisms originally draw energy from the sun.
Plants and other phototrophs use solar energy via a process known as photosynthesis to convert raw materials into organic molecules, such as ATP, whose bonds can be broken to release energy.
A few ecosystems, however, depend entirely on energy extracted by chemotrophs from methane, sulfides, or other non-luminal energy sources.Some of the captured energy is used to produce biomass to sustain life and provide energy for growth and development.
The majority of the rest of this energy is lost as heat and waste molecules.
The most important processes for converting the energy trapped in chemical substances into energy useful to sustain life are metabolism and cellular respiration.
What is the rate of recombination?
Recombination allows alleles on the same strand of DNA to become separated.
However, the rate of recombination is low (approximately two events per chromosome per generation).
As a result, genes close together on a chromosome may not always be shuffled away from each other and genes that are close together tend to be inherited together, a phenomenon known as linkage.
This tendency is measured by finding how often two alleles occur together on a single chromosome compared to expectations, which is called their linkage disequilibrium.
A set of alleles that is usually inherited in a group is called a haplotype.
This can be important when one allele in a particular haplotype is strongly beneficial: natural selection can drive a selective sweep that will also cause the other alleles in the haplotype to become more common in the population; this effect is called genetic hitchhiking or genetic draft.
Genetic draft caused by the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection can be partially captured by an appropriate effective population size.
What is the study of anatomy for artistic reasons called?
Superficial or surface anatomy is important as the study of anatomical landmarks that can be readily seen from the exterior contours of the body.
It enables physicians or veterinary surgeons to gauge the position and anatomy of the associated deeper structures.
Superficial is a directional term that indicates that structures are located relatively close to the surface of the body.
Comparative anatomy relates to the comparison of anatomical structures (both gross and microscopic) in different animals.
Anthropological anatomy or physical anthropology relates to the comparison of the anatomy of different races of humans.
Artistic anatomy relates to anatomic studies for artistic reasons.
Which country's intelligence agency did Louis de Wohl work for?
Cultural impact.Western politics and society.In the West, political leaders have sometimes consulted astrologers.
Louis de Wohl worked as an astrologer for the British intelligence agency MI5, after it was claimed that Hitler used astrology to time his actions.
The War Office was "interested to know what Hitler's own astrologers would be telling him from week to week".
In fact, de Wohl's predictions were so inaccurate that he was soon labelled a "complete charlatan" and it was later shown that Hitler considered astrology to be "complete nonsense".
After John Hinckley's attempted assassination of U.S. President Ronald Reagan, first lady Nancy Reagan commissioned astrologer Joan Quigley to act as the secret White House astrologer.
However, Quigley's role ended in 1988 when it became public through the memoirs of former chief of staff, Donald Regan.There was a boom in interest in astrology in the late 1960s.
The sociologist Marcello Truzzi described three levels of involvement of "Astrology-believers" to account for its revived popularity in the face of scientific discrediting.
He found that most astrology-believers did not claim it was a scientific explanation with predictive power.
Instead, those superficially involved, knowing "next to nothing" about astrology's 'mechanics', read newspaper astrology columns, and could benefit from "tension-management of anxieties" and "a cognitive belief-system that transcends science".
Those at the second level usually had their horoscopes cast and sought advice and predictions.
They were much younger than those at the first level, and could benefit from knowledge of the language of astrology and the resulting ability to belong to a coherent and exclusive group.
Those at the third level were highly involved and usually cast horoscopes for themselves.
Astrology provided this small minority of astrology-believers with a ""meaningful" view of their universe and them an "understanding" of their place in it."
This third group took astrology seriously, possibly as a "sacred canopy", whereas the other two groups took it playfully and irreverently.In 1953, sociologist Theodor W. Adorno conducted a study of the astrology column of a Los Angeles newspaper as part of a project examining mass culture in capitalist society.
Adorno believed that popular astrology, as a device, invariably led to statements which encouraged conformity, and that astrologers who went against conformity with statement discouraging performance at work etc.
would risk losing their jobs.
Adorno concluded that astrology was a large-scale manifestation of systematic irrationalism, where individuals were subtly being led to believe that the author of the column was addressing them directly through the use of flattery and vague generalisations.
Adorno drew a parallel with the phrase opium of the people, by Karl Marx, by commenting "occultism is the metaphysic of the dopes".A 2005 Gallup poll and a 2009 survey by the Pew Research Center reported that 25% of U.S. adults believe in astrology.
Which planet is closest to the Sun?
 Mercury (0.4 AU from the Sun) is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest planet in the Solar System (0.055 Earth masses).
Mercury has no natural satellites, and its only known geological features besides impact craters are lobed ridges or rupes, probably produced by a period of contraction early in its history.
Mercury's almost negligible atmosphere consists of atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind.
Its relatively large iron core and thin mantle have not yet been adequately explained.
Hypotheses include that its outer layers were stripped off by a giant impact; or, that it was prevented from fully accreting by the young Sun's energy.
How many missions did NASA's space shuttle program have before ending?
Space Shuttle program (1972–2011).The Space Shuttle became the major focus of NASA in the late 1970s and the 1980s.
Planned as a frequently launchable and mostly reusable vehicle, four space shuttle orbiters were built by 1985.
The first to launch, "Columbia", did so on April 12, 1981, the 20th anniversary of the first space flight by Yuri Gagarin.Its major components were a spaceplane orbiter with an external fuel tank and two solid fuel launch rockets at its side.
The external tank, which was bigger than the spacecraft itself, was the only component that was not reused.
The shuttle could orbit in altitudes of 185–643 km (115–400 miles) and carry a maximum payload (to low orbit) of 24,400 kg (54,000 lb).
Missions could last from 5 to 17 days and crews could be from 2 to 8 astronauts.On 20 missions (1983–98) the Space Shuttle carried Spacelab, designed in cooperation with the ESA.
Spacelab was not designed for independent orbital flight, but remained in the Shuttle's cargo bay as the astronauts entered and left it through an airlock.
Another famous series of missions were the launch and later successful repair of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and 1993, respectively.In 1995 Russian-American interaction resumed with the Shuttle-Mir missions (1995–1998).
Once more an American vehicle docked with a Russian craft, this time a full-fledged space station.
This cooperation has continued with Russia and the United States as the two of the biggest partners in the largest space station built: the International Space Station (ISS).
The strength of their cooperation on this project was even more evident when NASA began relying on Russian launch vehicles to service the ISS during the two-year grounding of the shuttle fleet following the 2003 Space Shuttle "Columbia" disaster.The Shuttle fleet lost two orbiters and 14 astronauts in two disasters: "Challenger" in 1986, and "Columbia" in 2003.
While the 1986 loss was mitigated by building the Space Shuttle "Endeavour" from replacement parts, NASA did not build another orbiter to replace the second loss.
NASA's Space Shuttle program had 135 missions when the program ended with the successful landing of the Space Shuttle "Atlantis" at the Kennedy Space Center on July 21, 2011.
The program spanned 30 years with over 300 astronauts sent into space.
Can RNA carry genetic Information?
 genomes.Like DNA, RNA can carry genetic information.
RNA viruses have genomes composed of RNA that encodes a number of proteins.
The viral genome is replicated by some of those proteins, while other proteins protect the genome as the virus particle moves to a new host cell.
Viroids are another group of pathogens, but they consist only of RNA, do not encode any protein and are replicated by a host plant cell's polymerase.
What year was the word Virus first used in English?
The word is from the Latin "virus" referring to poison and other noxious substances, first used in English in 1392.
"Virulent", from Latin "virulentus" (poisonous), dates to 1400.
A meaning of "agent that causes infectious disease" is first recorded in 1728, before the discovery of viruses by Dmitri Ivanovsky in 1892.
The English plural is "viruses", whereas the Latin word is a mass noun, which has no classically attested plural.
The adjective "viral" dates to 1948.
The term "virion" (plural "virions"), which dates from 1959, is also used to refer to a single, stable infective viral particle that is released from the cell and is fully capable of infecting other cells of the same type.
How many body lengths per second can swimming bacteria travel?
Many bacteria can move using a variety of mechanisms: flagella are used for swimming through fluids; bacterial gliding and twitching motility move bacteria across surfaces; and changes of buoyancy allow vertical motion.Swimming bacteria frequently move near 10 body lengths per second and a few as fast as 100.
This makes them at least as fast as fish, on a relative scale.In bacterial gliding and twitching motility, bacteria use their type IV pili as a grappling hook, repeatedly extending it, anchoring it and then retracting it with remarkable force (>80 pN).
Flagella are semi-rigid cylindrical structures that are rotated and function much like the propeller on a ship.
Objects as small as bacteria operate a low Reynolds number and cylindrical forms are more efficient than the flat, paddle-like, forms appropriate at human-size scale.Bacterial species differ in the number and arrangement of flagella on their surface; some have a single flagellum (monotrichous), a flagellum at each end (amphitrichous), clusters of flagella at the poles of the cell (lophotrichous), while others have flagella distributed over the entire surface of the cell (peritrichous).
The bacterial flagella is the best-understood motility structure in any organism and is made of about 20 proteins, with approximately another 30 proteins required for its regulation and assembly.
The flagellum is a rotating structure driven by a reversible motor at the base that uses the electrochemical gradient across the membrane for power.
This motor drives the motion of the filament, which acts as a propeller.Many bacteria (such as "E. coli") have two distinct modes of movement: forward movement (swimming) and tumbling.
The tumbling allows them to reorient and makes their movement a three-dimensional random walk.
(See external links below for link to videos.)
The flagella of a unique group of bacteria, the spirochaetes, are found between two membranes in the periplasmic space.
They have a distinctive helical body that twists about as it moves.Motile bacteria are attracted or repelled by certain stimuli in behaviors called taxes: these include chemotaxis, phototaxis, energy taxis, and magnetotaxis.
In one peculiar group, the myxobacteria, individual bacteria move together to form waves of cells that then differentiate to form fruiting bodies containing spores.
The myxobacteria move only when on solid surfaces, unlike "E. coli", which is motile in liquid or solid media.Several "Listeria" and "Shigella" species move inside host cells by usurping the cytoskeleton, which is normally used to move organelles inside the cell.
By promoting actin polymerization at one pole of their cells, they can form a kind of tail that pushes them through the host cell's cytoplasm.
What is year used to generate by aquarium hobbyists?
Yeast is often used by aquarium hobbyists to generate carbon dioxide (CO2) to nourish plants in planted aquaria.
A homemade setup is widely used as a cheap and simple alternative to pressurized CO2 systems.
While not as effective as these, the homemade setup is considerably cheaper for less-demanding hobbyists.Several recipes for homemade CO2 are available, but they are variations of the basic recipe: Baker's yeast, with sugar, baking soda, and water, are added to a plastic bottle.
A few drops of vegetable oil at the start reduces surface tension and speeds the release of CO2.
This will produce CO2 for about two or three weeks; the use of a bubble counter determines production.
The CO2 is injected in the aquarium through a narrow hose and released through a diffuser that helps dissolve the gas in the water.
The CO2 is used by plants in the photosynthesis process.
When was the first scanning tunneling microscope developed and by whom?
The 1980s saw the development of the first scanning probe microscopes.
The first was the scanning tunneling microscope in 1981, developed by Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer.
This was closely followed in 1986 with Gerd Binnig, Quate, and Gerber's invention of the atomic force microscope.
Why do telescopes such as TRACE and SOHO use special mirrors to reflect Extreme ultraviolet?
The name "telescope" covers a wide range of instruments.
Most detect electromagnetic radiation, but there are major differences in how astronomers must go about collecting light (electromagnetic radiation) in different frequency bands.Telescopes may be classified by the wavelengths of light they detect:
 X-ray telescopes, using shorter wavelengths than ultraviolet light
 Ultraviolet telescopes, using shorter wavelengths than visible light
 Optical telescopes, using visible light
 Infrared telescopes, using longer wavelengths than visible light
 Submillimetre telescopes, using longer wavelengths than infrared light
As wavelengths become longer, it becomes easier to use antenna technology to interact with electromagnetic radiation (although it is possible to make very tiny antenna).
The near-infrared can be handled much like visible light, however in the far-infrared and submillimetre range, telescopes can operate more like a radio telescope.
For example the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope observes from wavelengths from 3 μm (0.003 mm) to 2000 μm (2 mm), but uses a parabolic aluminum antenna.
On the other hand, the Spitzer Space Telescope, observing from about 3 μm (0.003 mm) to 180 μm (0.18 mm) uses a mirror (reflecting optics).
Also using reflecting optics, the Hubble Space Telescope with Wide Field Camera 3 can observe from about 0.2 μm (0.0002 mm) to 1.7 μm (0.0017 mm) (from ultra-violet to infrared light).
 Fresnel Imager, an optical lens technology
 X-ray optics, optics for certain X-ray wavelengths
Another threshold in telescope design, as photon energy increases (shorter wavelengths and higher frequency) is the use of fully reflecting optics rather than glancing-incident optics.
Telescopes such as TRACE and SOHO use special mirrors to reflect Extreme ultraviolet, producing higher resolution and brighter images then otherwise possible.
A larger aperture does not just mean more light is collected, it is collected at a higher diffraction limit.Telescopes may also be classified by location: ground telescope, space telescope, or flying telescope.
They may also be classified by whether they are operated by professional astronomers or amateur astronomers.
A vehicle or permanent campus containing one or more telescopes or other instruments is called an observatory.
What can escape from the inside of an event horizon of a black hole?
The defining feature of a black hole is the appearance of an event horizon—a boundary in spacetime through which matter and light can only pass inward towards the mass of the black hole.
Nothing, not even light, can escape from inside the event horizon.
The event horizon is referred to as such because if an event occurs within the boundary, information from that event cannot reach an outside observer, making it impossible to determine if such an event occurred.As predicted by general relativity, the presence of a mass deforms spacetime in such a way that the paths taken by particles bend towards the mass.
At the event horizon of a black hole, this deformation becomes so strong that there are no paths that lead away from the black hole.To a distant observer, clocks near a black hole appear to tick more slowly than those further away from the black hole.
Due to this effect, known as gravitational time dilation, an object falling into a black hole appears to slow down as it approaches the event horizon, taking an infinite time to reach it.
At the same time, all processes on this object slow down, for a fixed outside observer, causing emitted light to appear redder and dimmer, an effect known as gravitational redshift.
Eventually, at a point just before it reaches the event horizon, the falling object becomes so dim that it can no longer be seen.On the other hand, an indestructible observer falling into a black hole does not notice any of these effects as he crosses the event horizon.
According to his own clock, which appears to him to tick normally, he crosses the event horizon after a finite time without noting any singular behaviour.
In particular, he is unable to determine exactly when he crosses it, as it is impossible to determine the location of the event horizon from local observations.The shape of the event horizon of a black hole is always approximately spherical.
For non-rotating (static) black holes the geometry is precisely spherical, while for rotating black holes the sphere is somewhat oblate.
When is the Sun expected to spawn into a nebula?
Planetary nebulae form from the gaseous shells that are ejected from low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars when they transform into white dwarfs.
They are emission nebulae with spectra similar to those of emission nebulae found in star formation regions.
Technically they are HII regions, because most hydrogen will be ionized, but they are denser and more compact than the nebulae in star formation regions.
Planetary nebulae were given their name by the first astronomical observers who became able to distinguish them from planets, who tended to confuse them with planets, of more interest to them.
Our Sun is expected to spawn a planetary nebula about 12 billion years after its formation.
What is the spiral called that is caused by the rotation of the Sun?
Auroras are occasionally seen in temperate latitudes, when a magnetic storm temporarily enlarges the auroral oval.
Large magnetic storms are most common during the peak of the eleven-year sunspot cycle or during the three years after that peak.
Within the auroral zone the likelihood of an aurora occurring depends mostly on the slant of interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) lines (the slant is known as Bz), however, being greater with southward slants.Geomagnetic storms that ignite auroras actually happen more often during the months around the equinoxes.
It is not well understood why geomagnetic storms are tied to Earth's seasons while polar activity is not.
But it is known that during spring and autumn, the interplanetary magnetic field and that of Earth link up.
At the magnetopause, Earth's magnetic field points north.
When Bz becomes large and negative (i.e., the IMF tilts south), it can partially cancel Earth's magnetic field at the point of contact.
South-pointing Bzs open a door through which energy from the solar wind reaches Earth's inner magnetosphere.The peaking of Bz during this time is a result of geometry.
The IMF comes from the Sun and is carried outward with the solar wind.
The rotation of the Sun causes the IMF to have a spiral shape called the Parker spiral.
The southward (and northward) excursions of Bz are greatest during April and October, when Earth's magnetic dipole axis is most closely aligned with the Parker spiral.Bz is not the only influence on geomagnetic activity, however, the Sun's rotation axis is tilted 8 degrees with respect to the plane of Earth's orbit.
The solar wind blows more rapidly from the Sun's poles than from its equator, thus the average speed of particles buffeting Earth's magnetosphere waxes and wanes every six months.
The solar wind speed is greatest – by about 50 km/s, on average – around 5 September and 5 March when Earth lies at its highest heliographic latitude.Still, neither Bz nor the solar wind can fully explain the seasonal behavior of geomagnetic storms.
Those factors together contribute only about one-third of the observed semiannual variations.
What type of dish is a taco?
A taco () is a traditional Mexican dish composed of a corn or wheat tortilla folded or rolled around a filling.
A taco can be made with a variety of fillings, including beef, pork, chicken, seafood, vegetables and cheese, allowing for great versatility and variety.
A taco is generally eaten without utensils and is often accompanied by garnishes such as salsa, avocado or guacamole, cilantro, tomatoes, minced meat, onions and lettuce.
Is Tofu a common replacement for beef in burgers?
Burgers can also be made with patties made from ingredients other than beef.
For example, a "turkey burger" uses ground turkey meat, a "chicken burger" uses ground chicken meat.
A "buffalo burger" uses ground meat from a bison, and an "ostrich burger" is made from ground seasoned ostrich meat.
A deer burger uses ground venison from deer.A "veggie burger", "garden burger", or "tofu burger" uses a meat analogue, a meat substitute such as tofu, TVP, seitan (wheat gluten), quorn, beans, grains or an assortment of vegetables, ground up and mashed into patties.
How many variants of French Fries are there?
Variants of French fries include "thick-cut fries", "steak fries", "shoestring fries", "jojos", "crinkle fries", "curly fries", "hand-cut fries" and "tornado fries".
Fries cut into rough cubes instead of sticks are called "home fries".
Fries cut thickly with the skin left on are called "potato wedges", and fries without the skin are called "steak fries", essentially the American equivalent of the British "chip".
They can also be coated with breading, spices, or other ingredients, which include garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, paprika, and salt to create "seasoned fries", cheese to create "cheese fries", or chili to create "chili fries".
Sometimes, French fries are cooked in the oven as a final step in the preparation (having been coated with oil during preparation at the factory): these are often sold frozen and are called "oven fries" or "oven chips".
Some restaurants and groceries in North America offer French fries made from sweet potatoes instead of traditional white potatoes.In France, the thick-cut fries are called "Pommes Pont-Neuf" or simply "pommes frites", about 10 mm; thinner variants are "pommes allumettes" (matchstick potatoes), ±7 mm, and "pommes paille" (potato straws), 3–4 mm (roughly ⅜, ¼ and ⅛ inch respectively).
The two-bath technique is standard (Bocuse).
"Pommes gaufrettes" or "waffle fries" are not typical French fried potatoes, but actually crisps obtained by quarter-turning the potato before each next slide over a grater and deep-frying just once.
This results in large flat fries with two layers, each of which consists of parallel strips of potato.In an interview, Burger King president Donald Smith said that his chain's fries are sprayed with a sugar solution shortly before being packaged and shipped to individual outlets.
The sugar caramelizes in the cooking fat, producing the golden color customers expect.
McDonald's was assumed to fry their fries for a total time of about 15 to 20 minutes, and with fries fried at least twice.
What kind of meat is used to make Merguez?
Africa.North Africa.Merguez is a red, spicy sausage from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya, North Africa.
It is also popular in France, Israel and the German state of Saarland, where it is often grilled on a Schwenker.
Merguez is made with lamb, beef, or a mixture of both.
It can be flavored with a wide range of spices, such as sumac for tartness, and paprika, Cayenne pepper, or harissa, a hot chili paste that gives it a red color.
It is stuffed into a lamb casing, rather than a pork casing.
It is traditionally made fresh and eaten grilled or with couscous.
Sun-dried merguez is used to add flavor to tagines.
It is also eaten in sandwiches.
The Humane Society of the United States investigated which company that supplies Walmart with pig products?
Bacon has received mixed reviews from the public.On one hand, bacon has received a positive reception by the public.
"Bacon Today" states that bacon has a very valuable amount of protein that is "valuable to maintaining our energy levels and a fully functioning, healthy body, with a minimum of those nasty, waist, thigh and butt expanding, fat building carbohydrates."
"Everything Tastes Better with Bacon", a book by Sara Perry, is a cookbook that compliments bacon's many uses in cooking.On the other hand, as with most meat products, producers of bacon have received heavy criticism for how their pigs are treated.
Many petitions and protests have occurred trying to raise awareness and change how producers treat their pigs.
Many of these protests have turned out successful: for example, following NBC News's report of an undercover investigation of an abusive pig farm, Tyson Foods terminated their contract with the pig farm.
Similar to NBC's investigation, The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) investigated Seaboard Foods, one of the pig breeding facilities that supply Walmart.
According to HSUS, the pigs were treated poorly and abused.
Walmart spokesperson Diana Gee said, ""As soon as we were made aware of the allegations, we immediately reached out to Seaboard to begin investigating the issue ...
Pending our review, we will take any action necessary.""
Petitions also exist that oppose poor treatment of pigs, many of which state that the current treatment of pigs in factories is cruel and unethical.
What does shisk kebab mean in Turkish?
Shish kebab ("Şiş", pronounced , meaning "skewer" is a Turkish word.)
is a dish consisting of meat threaded on a skewer and grilled.
Any kind of meat may be used; cubes of fruit or vegetables are often threaded on the spit as well.
Typical vegetables include tomato, bell pepper, onions, and mushrooms.In the USA, the word "kebab" usually refers to shish kebab.
What was the first company to export instant ramen noodles?
Instant ramen noodles were exported from Japan by Nissin Foods starting in 1971, bearing the name "Oodles of Noodles".
One year later, it was re-branded "Nissin Cup Noodles," packaged in a foam food container, and subsequently saw a growth in international sales.
Over time, the term "ramen" became used in North America to refer to other instant noodles, even those not technically ramen.
What century did Kukai travel to china to study?
There are many stories explaining the origin of udon.One story says that in AD.1241, Enni, a Rinzai monk, introduced flour milling technology to Japan.
Floured crops were then made into noodles such as udon, soba, and pancakes which were eaten by locals.
Milling techniques were spread around the country.In the Edo period, the thicker wheat noodle was generally called udon, and served with a hot broth called nurumugi(温麦).
The chilled variety was called hiyamugi(冷麦).Another story states that in Nara period, a Japanese envoy was introduced to 14 kinds of confection whilst in Tang Dynasty China.
One of them was called sakubei(索餅).
Sakubei was listed as 'muginawa'(牟義縄) on Shin Senji Kyo(新撰字鏡), a dictionary which was published in Heian Era.
The muginawa is believed to be an origin for many kinds of Japanese noodles.
However, the muginawa listed on Shin Senji Kyo(新撰字鏡) was made with wheat and rice flour.Another historical story for udon claims that the original name of the noodle was 'konton', which was made with wheat flour and sweet fillings.Yet another story says that a Buddhist priest called Kukai introduced udon noodles to Shikoku during the Heian Era.In China, similar thick wheat flour noodles are called "cū miàn" (粗麵).
This noodle was 2 to 3 mm in diameter, a flat pancake-shaped "noodle" added to miso-based soup.
The Sino-Japanese characters for udon (饂飩) is similar to, but different from, the modern Chinese characters for wonton, which is called hún dùn in Mandarin (馄炖), a type of dumplings.In Chinese, udon noodles are called "wūdōngmiàn" (烏冬 "wūdōng" or 烏冬麵), and sometimes "wūlóngmiàn" (烏龍麵), which has the same characters as those used in "Oolong" tea ("wūlóngchá", 烏龍茶), though there is no semantic relation between the two usages.Kūkai, the Buddhist priest, traveled to China around the beginning of the 9th century to study.
Sanuki Province claimed to have been the first to adopt udon noodles from Kūkai.
Hakata claimed to have produced udon noodles based on Enni's recipe.
What has the United States set as a limit for arsenic in drinking water?
Rice and rice products contain arsenic, a known poison and Group 1 carcinogen.
There is no safe level of arsenic, but, as of 2012, a limit of 10 parts per billion has been established in the United States for drinking water, twice the level of 5 parts per billion originally proposed by the EPA.
Consumption of one serving of some varieties of rice gives more exposure to arsenic than consumption of 1 liter of water that contains 5 parts per billion arsenic; however, the amount of arsenic in rice varies widely with the greatest concentration in brown rice and rice grown on land formerly used to grow cotton; in the United States, Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Texas.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is studying this issue, but has not established a limit.
China has set a limit of 150 ppb for arsenic in rice.White rice grown in Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Texas, which account for 76 percent of American-produced rice had higher levels of arsenic than other regions of the world studied, possibly because of past use of arsenic-based pesticides to control cotton weevils.
Rice from Thailand and India contain the least arsenic among rice varieties in one study.
Why is the upper sirloin is generally more expensive than the lower sirloin?
The sirloin steak is a portion of the sirloin part of the cow which is near the cow's rear, the nearer the meat is from the rear, the tenderer it is likely to be, like the rump steak.
Although there are two parts of the sirloin: upper sirloin is generally more expensive than the lower sirloin because it is more tender.
Sirloin steaks are often served at steakhouses and are often accompanied with French fries and vegetables such as broccoli, carrot or peas.
They are usually cooked by grilling or frying.
What form of cheese is best for salad toppings?
Popular salad garnishes are nuts, croutons, anchovies, bacon bits (real or imitation), garden beet,bell peppers, shredded carrots, diced celery, watercress, sliced cucumber, parsley, sliced mushrooms, sliced red onion, radish, french fries, sunflower seeds (shelled), real or artificial crab meat (surimi) and cherry tomatoes.
Various cheeses, berries, seeds and other ingredients can also be added to green salads.
Cheeses, in the form of cubes, crumbles, or grated, are often used, including blue cheese, Parmesan cheese, and feta cheese.
Color considerations are sometimes addressed by using edible flowers, red radishes, carrots, various colors of peppers, and other colorful ingredients.
When air-popped without butter or salt, how much sugar and sodium does popcorn contain?
Air-popped popcorn is naturally high in dietary fiber and antioxidants, low in calories and fat, and free of sugar and sodium.
This can make it an attractive snack to people with dietary restrictions on the intake of calories, fat, and/or sodium.
For the sake of flavor, however, large amounts of fat, sugar, and sodium are often added to prepared popcorn, which can quickly convert it to a very poor choice for those on restricted diets.One particularly notorious example of this first came to public attention in the mid-1990s, when the Center for Science in the Public Interest produced a report about "Movie Popcorn", which became the subject of a widespread publicity campaign.
The movie theaters surveyed used coconut oil to pop the corn, and then topped it with butter or margarine.
"A medium-size buttered popcorn", the report said, "contains more fat than a breakfast of bacon and eggs, a Big Mac and fries, and a steak dinner combined."
The practice continues today.
For example, according to DietFacts.com, a small popcorn from Regal Cinema Group (the largest theater chain in the United States) still contains 29 g of saturated fat.
the equivalent of a full day-and-a-half's reference daily intake.
What do commercial bakeries do to lard to introduce air bubbles?
 decorating.A finished cake is often enhanced by covering it with icing, or frosting, and toppings such as sprinkles, which are also known as "jimmies" in certain parts of the United States and "hundreds and thousands" in the United Kingdom.
Frosting is usually made from powdered (icing) sugar, sometimes a fat of some sort, milk or cream, and often flavorings such as vanilla extract or cocoa powder.
Some decorators use a rolled fondant icing.
Commercial bakeries tend to use lard for the fat, and often whip the lard to introduce air bubbles.
This makes the icing light and spreadable.
Home bakers either use lard, butter, margarine or some combination thereof.
Sprinkles are small firm pieces of sugar and oils that are colored with food coloring.
In the late 20th century, new cake decorating products became available to the public.
These include several specialized sprinkles and even methods to print pictures and transfer the image onto a cake.Special tools are needed for more complex cake decorating, such as piping bags or syringes, and various piping tips.
To use a piping bag or syringe, a piping tip is attached to the bag or syringe using a coupler.
The bag or syringe is partially filled with icing which is sometimes colored.
Using different piping tips and various techniques, a cake decorator can make many different designs.
Basic decorating tips include open star, closed star, basketweave, round, drop flower, leaf, multi, petal, and specialty tips.Royal icing, marzipan (or a less sweet version, known as almond paste), fondant icing(also known as sugarpaste) and buttercream are used as covering icings and to create decorations.
Floral sugarcraft or wired sugar flowers are an important part of cake decoration.
Cakes for special occasions, such as wedding cakes, are traditionally rich fruit cakes or occasionally Madeira cakes, that are covered with marzipan and iced using royal icing or sugar-paste.
They are finished with piped borders (made with royal icing) and adorned with a piped message, wired sugar flowers, hand-formed fondant flowers, marzipan fruit, piped flowers, or crystallized fruits or flowers such as grapes or violets.

What does evidence suggest about the strength of roasted coffee's antioxidant effects?
According to Cancer Research UK, the results of the large-scale study published in 2012 clarified the evidence of the effect of coffee drinking on cancer, and that evidence beforehand had been conflicting.
They say the study showed that drinking coffee "had no effect on the risk of dying from cancer.
"Other studies suggest coffee consumption reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease, dementia, Parkinson's disease, heart disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, and gout.The fact that decaffeinated coffee also exhibits preventative effects against diseases such as prostate cancer and type 2 diabetes suggests that coffee's health benefits are not solely a product of its caffeine content.Specifically, the antidiabetic effect of caffeine has been attributed to caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid.The presence of antioxidants in coffee has been shown to prevent free radicals from causing cell damage.
Evidence suggests that roasted coffee has a stronger antioxidant effect than green coffee.Coffee is no longer thought to be a risk factor for coronary heart disease.
A 2012 meta-analysis concluded that people who drank moderate amounts of coffee had a lower rate of heart failure, with the biggest effect found for those who drank more than four cups a day.Moreover, habitual coffee consumption is associated with improved vascular function.In a ten year study among 50,739 US women (mean age, 63 years) free of depressive symptoms at baseline (in 1996), coffee consumption was negatively correlated with risk of developing depression.A review published in 2004 indicated a negative correlation between suicide rates and coffee consumption.It was suggested that the action of caffeine in blocking the inhibitory effects of adenosine on dopamine nerves in the brain reduced feelings of depression.Coffee consumption is also associated with improved endothelial function.
Coffee extracts have been shown to inhibit 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, enzyme which converts cortisone to cortisol and is a current pharmaceutical target for the treatment of diabetes type 2 and the metabolic syndrome.
Which vitamin is orange juice rich in?
Juices are often consumed for their perceived health benefits.
For example, orange juice is rich in vitamin C, folic acid, potassium, is an excellent source of bioavailable antioxidant phytochemicals and significantly improves blood lipid profiles in people affected with hypercholesterolemia.
Prune juice is associated with a digestive health benefit.
Cranberry juice has long been known to help prevent or even treat bladder infections, and it is now known that a substance in cranberries prevents bacteria from binding to the bladder.Many fruit juices have a higher sugar (fructose) content than sweetened soft drinks; e.g., typical grape juice has 50% more sugar than Coca-Cola.
While soft drinks (e.g.
Coca-Cola) cause oxidative stress when ingested and may even lead to insulin resistance in the long term, the same thing cannot be attributed to fruit juices.
On the contrary, fruit juices are actually known for their ability to raise serum antioxidant capacity and even offset the oxidative stress and inflammation normally caused by high-fat and high-sugar meals.Fruit juice consumption overall in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and the US has increased in recent years, probably due to public perception of juices as a healthy natural source of nutrients and increased public interest in health issues.
Indeed, fruit juice intake has been consistently associated with reduced risk of many cancer types, might be protective against stroke and delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease.The perception of commercial fruit juice as equal in health benefit to fresh fruit has been questioned, mainly because it lacks fiber and has often been highly processed.
High-fructose corn syrup, an ingredient of many juice cocktails, has been linked to the increased incidence of type II diabetes.
High consumption of juice is also linked to weight gain in some studies, but not in others.
In a controlled clinical study, regular consumption of grape juice for 12 weeks did not cause any weight gain in volunteers, but consumption of a soft drink did.
Fruit juice in moderate amounts can help children and adults meet daily recommendations for fruit consumption, nutrient intake and calories.The American Academy of Pediatrics says that fruit juice should not be given to infants before 6 months of age.
For children ages 1 to 6, intake of fruit juice should be limited to 4 to 6 ounces per day (about a half to three-quarters of a cup).
Giving children excessive juice can lead to poor nutrition, diarrhea, gas, abdominal pain, bloating, and tooth decay.

What date did the Beatles perform their Rooftop Concert at the Apple Building?
A week later the band agreed to Harrison's terms for returning to the group, which included abandoning the cold and cavernous soundstage at Twickenham.
Sessions resumed on 22 January when the Beatles moved to Apple Studios.
Multi-track recording began on that date and continued until 31 January.
Harrison brought in keyboardist Billy Preston to ease tensions and supplement the band for the live performances.
Preston worked with the Beatles throughout their stay at Apple Studios.The live concert idea culminated with the Beatles and Preston performing on 30 January on the rooftop of the Beatles' Apple Building at 3 Savile Row before a small audience of friends and employees.
The performance was cut short by the police after complaints about noise.
The complete concert has circulated among bootleg collectors for many years.

Much of the band's attention was focused on a broad range of covers, extended jams on 12-bar blues, and occasional new efforts such as Lennon's uncompleted "Madman".
These included classical pieces such as Samuel Barber's "Adagio for Strings", jazz standards such as "Ain't She Sweet", and an encyclopaedic array of songs from the early rock and roll era such as "Stand By Me", "Words of Love", "Lonely Sea", "Bésame Mucho" by Mexican composer Consuelo Velázquez (a song that was part of The Beatles' repertoire in the early days) and "Blue Suede Shoes".
Multiple Bob Dylan songs were also played, including "Positively 4th Street", "All Along the Watchtower" and "I Shall Be Released".

What were three previous titles of the show now known as  "Friends"?
Production.Conception.David Crane and Marta Kauffman began developing three new television pilots that would premiere in 1994 after their sitcom "Family Album" was cancelled by CBS in 1993.
Kauffman and Crane decided to pitch the series about "six people in their 20s making their way in Manhattan" to NBC, since they thought it would fit best there.
Crane and Kauffman presented the idea to their production partner Kevin Bright, who had served as executive producer on their HBO series "Dream On".
The idea for the series was conceived when Crane and Kauffman began thinking about the time when they had finished college and started living by themselves in New York; Kauffman believed they were looking at a time when the future was "more of a question mark."
They found the concept to be interesting, as they believed "everybody knows that feeling," and because it was also how they felt about their own lives at the time.
The team titled the series "Insomnia Cafe", and pitched the idea as a seven-page treatment to NBC in December 1993.At the same time, Warren Littlefield, the then-president of NBC Entertainment, was seeking a comedy involving young people living together and sharing expenses.
Littlefield wanted the group to share memorable periods of their lives with friends, who had become "new, surrogate family members".
However, Littlefield found difficulty in bringing the concept to life, and found the scripts developed by NBC to be terrible.
When Kauffman, Crane and Bright pitched "Insomnia Cafe", Littlefield was impressed that they knew who their characters were.
NBC bought the idea as a put pilot, meaning they risked financial penalties if the pilot was not filmed.
Kauffman and Crane began writing a pilot script for a show now titled "Friends Like Us", which took three days to write.
Littlefield wanted the series to represent Generation X and explore a new kind of tribal bonding, but the trio did not share his vision.
Crane argued that it was not a series for one generation, and wanted to produce a series that everyone would enjoy watching.
NBC liked the pilot script and ordered the series under another title, "Six of One", mainly due to the similar title it shared with the ABC sitcom "These Friends of Mine".

What is TARDIS?
Doctor Who is a British science-fiction television programme produced by the BBC.
The programme depicts the adventures of the Doctor, a Time Lord—a time-travelling humanoid alien.
He explores the universe in his TARDIS, a sentient time-travelling space ship.
Its exterior appears as a blue British police box, which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series first aired.
Along with a succession of companions, the Doctor faces a variety of foes while working to save civilisations, help ordinary people, and right wrongs.The show has received recognition as one of Britain's finest television programmes, winning the 2006 British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series and five consecutive (2005–2010) awards at the National Television Awards during Russell T Davies's tenure as executive producer.
In 2011, Matt Smith became the first Doctor to be nominated for a BAFTA Television Award for Best Actor.
In 2013, the Peabody Awards honoured "Doctor Who" with an Institutional Peabody "for evolving with technology and the times like nothing else in the known television universe."
The programme is listed in "Guinness World Records" as the longest-running science fiction television show in the world, the "most successful" science fiction series of all time—based on its over-all broadcast ratings, DVD and book sales, and iTunes traffic— and for the largest ever simulcast of a TV drama with its 50th anniversary special.
During its original run, it was recognised for its imaginative stories, creative low-budget special effects, and pioneering use of electronic music (originally produced by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop).The show is a significant part of British popular culture,</ref> and elsewhere it has become a cult television favourite.
The show has influenced generations of British television professionals, many of whom grew up watching the series.
The programme originally ran from 1963 to 1989.
After an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a backdoor pilot in the form of a television film, the programme was relaunched in 2005 by Russell T Davies who was showrunner and head writer for the first five years of its revival, produced in-house by BBC Wales in Cardiff.
The first series of the 21st century, featuring Christopher Eccleston in the title role, was produced by the BBC.
Series two and three had some development money contributed by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), which was credited as a co-producer.
"Doctor Who" also spawned spin-offs in multiple media, including "Torchwood" (2006–11) and "The Sarah Jane Adventures" (2007–11), both created by Russell T Davies; "K-9" (2009–10); and a single pilot episode of "K-9 and Company" (1981).
There also have been many spoofs and cultural references of the character in other media.Eleven actors have headlined the series as the Doctor.
The transition from one actor to another, and the differing approach to the role that they bring, is written into the plot of the show as regeneration into a new incarnation, a life process of Time Lords through which the character of the Doctor takes on a new body and, to some extent, new personality, which occurs after sustaining injury which would be fatal to most other species.
While each actor's portrayal differs, they are all intended to be aspects of the same character, and form part of the same storyline.
The time-travelling nature of the plot means that on occasion, story arcs have involved different Doctors meeting each other.
The Doctor is currently portrayed by Peter Capaldi, who took on the role after Matt Smith's final appearance in the 2013 Christmas special "The Time of the Doctor".

What kind of humor does Family Guy often use?
"Family Guy" uses the filmmaking technique of cutaways, which occur in the majority of "Family Guy" episodes.
Emphasis is often placed on gags which make reference to current events and/or modern cultural icons.Early episodes based much of their comedy on Stewie's "super villain" antics, such as his constant plans for total world domination, his evil experiments, plans and inventions to get rid of things he dislikes, and his constant attempts at matricide.
As the series progressed, the writers and MacFarlane agreed that his personality and the jokes were starting to feel dated, so they began writing him with a different personality.
"Family Guy" often includes self-referential humor.
The most common form is jokes about Fox Broadcasting, and occasions where the characters break the fourth wall by addressing the audience.
For example, in "North by North Quahog", the first episode that aired after the show's revival, included Peter telling the family that they had been cancelled because Fox had to make room in their schedule for shows like "Dark Angel", "Titus", "Undeclared", "Action", "That '80s Show", "Wonderfalls", "Fastlane", "Andy Richter Controls the Universe", "Skin", "Girls Club", "Cracking Up", "The Pitts", "Firefly", "Get Real", "Freakylinks", "Wanda at Large", "Costello", "The Lone Gunmen", "A Minute with Stan Hooper", "Normal, Ohio", "Pasadena", "Harsh Realm", "Keen Eddie", "The $treet", "The American Embassy", "Cedric the Entertainer Presents", "The Tick", "Luis", and "Greg the Bunny".
Lois asks whether there is any hope, to which Peter replies that if all these shows are canceled they might have a chance; the shows were indeed canceled during "Family Guy"s hiatus.The show uses catchphrases, and most of the primary and secondary characters have them.
Notable expressions include Quagmire's "Giggity giggity goo", Peter's "Freakin' sweet", and Joe's "Bring it on!"
The use of many of these catchphrases declined in later seasons.
The episode "Big Man on Hippocampus" mocks catchphrase-based humor: when Peter, who has forgotten everything about his life, is introduced to Meg, he exclaims "D'oh!
", to which Lois replies, "No, Peter, that's not your catchphrase."

In 1998, "South Park" was nominated for the Annie Award for Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Primetime or Late Night Television Program.
It was also nominated for the 1998 GLAAD Award for Outstanding TV – Individual Episode for "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride".
"South Park" has been nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program ten times (1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010 and 2013).
The show has won the award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming Less Than One Hour) four times, for the 2005 episode "Best Friends Forever", the 2006 episode "Make Love, Not Warcraft", the 2009 episode "Margaritaville", and the 2012 episode "Raising the Bar".
The Imaginationland trilogy of episodes won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming One Hour Or More) in 2008.
In what year did Stone Mountain Park provide venues for Olympic events in tennis, archery, and track cycling?
Human habitation of Stone Mountain and its surroundings date back into prehistory.
When the mountain was first encountered by European explorers, its summit was encircled by a rock wall, similar to that still to be found on Georgia's Fort Mountain.
The wall is believed to have been built by early Native American inhabitants of the area, although its purpose remains unclear.
By the beginning of the 20th century the wall had disappeared, the rocks having been taken away by early visitors as souvenirs, rolled down the rockface, or removed by the commercial quarrying operation.
The mountain was as well the eastern end of the Campbelton Trail, a Native American path that ran through what is now the Atlanta area.Europeans first learned of the mountain in 1597, when Spanish explorers were told of a mountain further inland which was "very high, shining when the sun set like a fire."
By this time, the Stone Mountain area was inhabited by the Creek and (to a lesser extent) Cherokee peoples.
In 1790 the mountain was the site of a meeting initiated by President George Washington in hopes of negotiating a peace treaty with the Creek.
Instead a series of wars ensued, and the Creek were forced to cede the land to the state of Georgia in 1821.In the early 19th century, the area was known as Rock Mountain.
After the founding of DeKalb County and the county seat of Decatur in 1822 Stone Mountain was a natural recreation area; it was common for young men to take their dates on horseback from Decatur to the mountain.Entrepreneur Aaron Cloud built a 165 foot (50 m) wooden observation tower at the summit of the mountain in 1838, but it was destroyed by a storm and replaced by a much smaller tower in 1851.
Visitors to the mountain would travel to the area by rail and road, and then walk up the 1.1 mile mountaintop trail to the top, where Cloud also had a restaurant and club.Granite quarrying started at Stone Mountain in the 1830s, but became a major industry following the completion of a railroad spur to the quarry site in 1847.
This line was rebuilt by the Georgia Railroad in 1869.
Over the years, Stone Mountain granite was used in many buildings and structures, including the locks of the Panama Canal, the steps to the East Wing of the United States Capitol and the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo.
In recent years, granite suppliers in Georgia sent stone samples cut from Stone Mountain to the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Foundation to be considered for use in a planned monument in King's honor; the Foundation later chose to use granite imported from China.
Unfortunately, quarrying during earlier periods also destroyed several spectacular geological features on Stone Mountain, such as the Devil's Crossroads, which was located on top of the mountain.In 1887 Stone Mountain was purchased for $45,000 by the Venable Brothers of Atlanta, who quarried the mountain for 24 more years, and descendents of the Venable family would retain ownership of the mountain until it was purchased by the State of Georgia in the 1950s.Martin Luther King, Jr. mentioned the monument in his 1963 "I Have a Dream" speech in Washington, D.C., when he said "let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia!"
During the 1996 Summer Olympics, Stone Mountain Park provided venues for Olympic events in tennis, archery and track cycling.
The venues for archery and cycling were temporary and are now part of the songbird and habitat trail.
What is the name of the garden on the Candadian side of Niagara Falls?
On the Canadian side, Queen Victoria Park features manicured gardens, platforms offering spectacular views of both the American and Horseshoe Falls, and underground walkways leading into observation rooms that yield the illusion of being within the falling waters.
The observation deck of the nearby Skylon Tower offers the highest overhead view of the falls, and in the opposite direction gives views as far as distant Toronto.
Along with the Minolta Tower (formerly the Seagrams Tower and the Konica Minolta Tower, now called the Tower Hotel), it is one of two towers in Canada with a view of the falls.Along the Niagara River, the Niagara River Recreational Trail runs the 35 miles (56 km) from Fort Erie to Fort George, and includes many historical sites from the War of 1812.The Whirlpool Aero Car, built in 1916 from a design by Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres y Quevedo, is a cable car that takes passengers over the Niagara Whirlpool on the Canadian side.
The "Journey Behind the Falls"—accessible by elevators from the street level entrance—consists of an observation platform and series of tunnels near the bottom of the Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side.There are two casinos on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls, the Niagara Fallsview Casino Resort and Casino Niagara.
The former is situated in the Fallsview Tourist Area, alongside many of the area's hotels, whilst the latter is adjacent to Clifton Hill, on Falls Avenue, a major tourist promenade.
How many degrees to the ground does The Leaning Tower of Wanaka in New Zealand lean?
Two German churches have challenged the tower's status as the world's most lop-sided building: the 15th-century square Leaning Tower of Suurhusen and the 14th-century bell tower in the town of Bad Frankenhausen.
"Guinness World Records" measured the Pisa and Suurhusen towers, finding the former's tilt to be 3.97 degrees.
In June 2010, "Guinness World Records" certified the Capital Gate building in Abu Dhabi, UAE as the "World's Furthest Leaning Man-made Tower".
The Capital Gate tower has an 18-degree slope, almost five times more than the Pisa Tower; however the Capital Gate tower has been deliberately engineered to slant.
The Leaning Tower of Wanaka in New Zealand, also deliberately built, leans at 53 degrees to the ground.
How many people ascended the Eiffel Tower in 2011?
The Eiffel Tower (, ) is an iron lattice tower located on the Champ de Mars in Paris.
It was named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.
Erected in 1889 as the entrance arch to the 1889 World's Fair, it was initially criticised by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but has become both a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world.
The tower is the tallest structure in Paris and the most-visited paid monument in the world; 6.98 million people ascended it in 2011.
The tower received its 250 millionth visitor in 2010.The tower is tall, about the same height as an 81- building.
During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to assume the title of the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years, until the Chrysler Building in New York City was built in 1930.
Because of the addition of the antenna atop the Eiffel Tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by .
Not including broadcast antennae, it is the second-tallest structure in France, after the Millau Viaduct.The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second.
The third level observatory's upper platform is above the ground, the highest accessible to the public in the European Union.
Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift (elevator) to the first and second levels.
The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the walk from the first to the second level.
Although there are stairs to the third and highest level, these are usually closed to the public and it is generally only accessible by lift.
On which side of Machu Picchu is Intimachay located?
Intimachay is a special cave designed to celebrate and observe the Royal Feast of the Sun.
This festival was only to be celebrated by nobility in the Incan month of Capac Raymi and was associated with the December solstice.
The festival would begin earlier in the month and would conclude on the solstice.
On this day, boys of nobility would be initiated into manhood by conducting an ear-piercing ritual as they watched the sun rise from within the cave.Architecturally, Intimachay is the most significant structure located at Machu Picchu.
Its entrances, walls, steps and windows are all comprised with some of the finest masonry found in Incan Empire.
The cave also includes a unique tunnel-like window which cannot be found in any other Incan structure.
This window was strategically constructed to only allow sunlight into the cave for a span of several days around the time of the December solstice.
For this reason, the cave was inaccessible for much of the year.
Intimachay is located on the eastern side of Machu Picchu, just north of the "Condor Stone."
Many of the caves surrounding this area were prehistorically used as tombs, yet there is no evidence to suggest that it too was a burial ground.
What year did construction begin at Disneyland?
Disneyland Park, originally Disneyland, is the first of two theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, opened on July 17, 1955.
It is the only theme park designed and built under the direct supervision of Walt Disney.
It was originally the only attraction on the property; its name was changed to Disneyland Park to distinguish it from the expanding complex in the 1990s.Walt Disney came up with the concept of Disneyland after visiting various amusement parks with his daughters in the 1930s and 1940s.
He initially envisioned building a tourist attraction adjacent to his studios in Burbank to entertain fans who wished to visit; however, he soon realized that the proposed site was too small.
After hiring a consultant to help him determine an appropriate site for his project, Walt bought a site near Anaheim in 1953.
Construction began in 1954 and the park was unveiled during a special televised press event on the ABC Television Network on July 17, 1955.Since its opening, Disneyland has undergone a number of expansions and renovations, including the addition of New Orleans Square in 1966, Bear Country (now Critter Country) in 1972, and Mickey's Toontown in 1993.
Disney California Adventure Park was built on the site of Disneyland's original parking lot and opened in 2001.Disneyland has a larger cumulative attendance than any other theme park in the world, with over 650 million guests since it opened.
In 2011, the park hosted approximately 16.14 million guests, making it the second most visited park in the world that calendar year.
According to a March 2005 report from the Disney Company, there are 65,700 jobs supported by the Disneyland Resort, which includes, at the Resort itself, 20,000 direct Disney employees and 3,800 third-party employees (that is, independent contractors or their employees).
What expedition did Ed Lu take part in?
A more controversial question is whether the Wall is visible from low Earth orbit (an altitude of as little as ).
NASA claims that it is barely visible, and only under nearly perfect conditions; it is no more conspicuous than many other man-made objects.
Other authors have argued that due to limitations of the optics of the eye and the spacing of photoreceptors on the retina, it is impossible to see the wall with the naked eye, even from low orbit, and would require visual acuity of 20/3 (7.7 times better than normal).Astronaut William Pogue thought he had seen it from Skylab but discovered he was actually looking at the Grand Canal of China near Beijing.
He spotted the Great Wall with binoculars, but said that "it wasn't visible to the unaided eye."
U.S.
Senator Jake Garn claimed to be able to see the Great Wall with the naked eye from a space shuttle orbit in the early 1980s, but his claim has been disputed by several U.S. astronauts.
Veteran U.S. astronaut Gene Cernan has stated: "At Earth orbit of to high, the Great Wall of China is, indeed, visible to the naked eye."
Ed Lu, Expedition 7 Science Officer aboard the International Space Station, adds that, "it's less visible than a lot of other objects.
And you have to know where to look.
"In 2001, Neil Armstrong stated about the view from Apollo 11: "I do not believe that, at least with my eyes, there would be any man-made object that I could see.
I have not yet found somebody who has told me they've seen the Wall of China from Earth orbit.
...I've asked various people, particularly Shuttle guys, that have been many orbits around China in the daytime, and the ones I've talked to didn't see it.
"In October 2003, Chinese astronaut Yang Liwei stated that he had not been able to see the Great Wall of China.
In response, the European Space Agency (ESA) issued a press release reporting that from an orbit between , the Great Wall is visible to the naked eye.
In an attempt to further clarify things, the ESA published a picture of a part of the “Great Wall” photographed from Space.
However, in a press release a week later (no longer available in the ESA’s website), they acknowledged that the "Great Wall" in the picture was actually a river.Leroy Chiao, a Chinese-American astronaut, took a photograph from the International Space Station that shows the wall.
It was so indistinct that the photographer was not certain he had actually captured it.
Based on the photograph, the "China Daily" later reported that the Great Wall can be seen from space with the naked eye, under favorable viewing conditions, if one knows exactly where to look.
However, the resolution of a camera can be much higher than the human visual system, and the optics much better, rendering photographic evidence irrelevant to the issue of whether it is visible to the naked eye.
What is the group called that patrols the main tourist areas and wears reflective yellow bibs?
Natural environment.National parks.The two national parks at the falls are relatively small—Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park is and Victoria Falls National Park is .
However, next to the latter on the southern bank is the Zambezi National Park, extending west along the river.
Animals can move between the two Zimbabwean parks and can also reach Matetsi Safari Area, Kazuma Pan National Park and Hwange National Park to the south.On the Zambian side, fences and the outskirts of Livingstone tend to confine most animals to the Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park.
In addition fences put up by lodges in response to crime restrict animal movement.In 2004 a separate group of police called the Tourism Police was started.
They are commonly seen around the main tourist areas, and can be identified by their uniforms with yellow reflective bibs.
What four geyers are located in the Upper Geyer Basic of Yellowstone National Park?
The most famous geyser in the park, and perhaps the world, is Old Faithful Geyser, located in Upper Geyser Basin.
Castle Geyser, Lion Geyser and Beehive Geyser are in the same basin.
The park contains the largest active geyser in the world—Steamboat Geyser in the Norris Geyser Basin.
A study that was completed in 2011 found that at least 1283 geysers have erupted in Yellowstone.
Of these, an average of 465 are active in a given year.
Yellowstone contains at least 10,000 geothermal features altogether.
Half the geothermal features and two-thirds of the world's geysers are concentrated in Yellowstone.In May 2001, the U.S. Geological Survey, Yellowstone National Park, and the University of Utah created the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory (YVO), a partnership for long-term monitoring of the geological processes of the Yellowstone Plateau volcanic field, for disseminating information concerning the potential hazards of this geologically active region.In 2003, changes at the Norris Geyser Basin resulted in the temporary closure of some trails in the basin.
New fumaroles were observed, and several geysers showed enhanced activity and increasing water temperatures.
Several geysers became so hot that they were transformed into purely steaming features; the water had become superheated and they could no longer erupt normally.
This coincided with the release of reports of a multiple year United States Geological Survey research project which mapped the bottom of Yellowstone Lake and identified a structural dome that had uplifted at some time in the past.
Research indicated that these uplifts posed no immediate threat of a volcanic eruption, since they may have developed long ago, and there had been no temperature increase found near the uplifts.
On March 10, 2004, a biologist discovered 5 dead bison which apparently had inhaled toxic geothermal gases trapped in the Norris Geyser Basin by a seasonal atmospheric inversion.
This was closely followed by an upsurge of earthquake activity in April 2004.
In 2006, it was reported that the Mallard Lake Dome and the Sour Creek Dome— areas that have long been known to show significant changes in their ground movement— had risen at a rate of per year from mid–2004 through 2006.
As of late 2007, the uplift has continued at a reduced rate.
These events inspired a great deal of media attention and speculation about the geologic future of the region.
Experts responded to the conjecture by informing the public that there was no increased risk of a volcanic eruption in the near future.
However, these changes demonstrate the dynamic nature of the Yellowstone hydrothermal system.
How many species of vertebrates can be found in Yosemite?
Biology.Habitats.With its scrubby sun-baked chaparral, stately groves of pine, fir, and sequoia, and expanses of alpine woodlands and meadows, Yosemite National Park preserves a Sierra Nevada landscape as it prevailed before Euro-American settlement.
In contrast to surrounding lands, which have been significantly altered by logging, the park still contains some of old-growth forest.
Taken together, the park's varied habitats support over 250 species of vertebrates, which include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.Along much of Yosemite's western boundary, habitats are dominated by mixed coniferous forests of Ponderosa Pine, Sugar Pine, Incense-cedar, White Fir, Douglas Fir, and a few stands of Giant Sequoia, interspersed by areas of Black Oak and Canyon Live Oak.
A relatively high diversity of wildlife species is supported by these habitats, because of relatively mild, lower-elevation climate and the mixture of habitat types and plant species.
Wildlife species typically found in these habitats include American black bear, Bobcat, Cougar, Gray fox, Mule deer, Mountain kingsnake, Gilbert's skink, White-headed Woodpecker, Brown Creeper, Spotted Owl, and a wide variety of bat species.
In the case of bats, large snags are important as roost sites.Going higher in elevation, the coniferous forests become purer stands of Red Fir, Western White Pine, Jeffrey Pine, Lodgepole Pine, and the occasional Foxtail pine.
Fewer wildlife species tend to be found in these habitats, because of their higher elevation and lower complexity.
Species likely to be found include Golden-mantled Ground Squirrel, Chickaree, Fisher, Steller's Jay, Hermit Thrush, and Northern Goshawk.
Reptiles are not common, but include Rubber Boa, western fence lizard, and Northern Alligator Lizard.As the landscape rises, trees become smaller and more sparse, with stands broken by areas of exposed granite.
These include Lodgepole Pine, Whitebark Pine, and Mountain Hemlock that, at highest elevations, give way to vast expanses of granite as treeline is reached.
The climate in these habitats is harsh and the growing season is short, but species such as Pika, Yellow-bellied Marmot, White-tailed Jackrabbit, Clark's Nutcracker, and Black Rosy Finch are adapted to these conditions.
Also, the treeless alpine habitats are the areas favored by Sierra Nevada Bighorn Sheep.
This species, however, is now found in the Yosemite area only around Tioga Pass, where a small, reintroduced population exists.At a variety of elevations, meadows provide important, productive habitat for wildlife.
Animals come to feed on the green grasses and use the flowing and standing water found in many meadows.
Predators, in turn, are attracted to these areas.
The interface between meadow and forest is also favored by many animal species because of the proximity of open areas for foraging and cover for protection.
Species that are highly dependent upon meadow habitat include Great Grey Owl, Willow Flycatcher, Yosemite Toad, and Mountain Beaver.
How many bird species breed live primarily in the desert uplands and cliffs of the inner canyon?
The Upper Sonoran Life Zone includes most of the inner canyon and South Rim at elevations from .
This zone is generally dominated by blackbrush, sagebrush, and pinyon-juniper woodlands.
Elevations of are in the Mojave Desert Scrub community of the Upper Sonoran.
This community is dominated by the four-winged saltbush and creosote bush; other important plants include Utah agave, narrowleaf mesquite, ratany, catclaw, and various cacti species.Approximately 30 bird species breed primarily in the desert uplands and cliffs of the inner canyon.
Virtually all bird species present breed in other suitable habitats throughout the Sonoran and Mohave deserts.
The abundance of bats, swifts, and riparian birds provides ample food for peregrines, and suitable eyrie sites are plentiful along the steep canyon walls.
Also, several critically endangered California Condors that were re-introduced to the Colorado Plateau on the Arizona Strip, have made the eastern part of the Park their home.The conifer forests provide habitat for 52 mammal species.
Porcupines, shrews, red squirrels, tassel eared Kaibab and Abert's squirrels, black bear, mule deer, and elk are found at the park's higher elevations on the Kaibab Plateau.Above the desert scrub and up to is a pinyon pine forest and one seed juniper woodland.
Within this woodland one can find big sagebrush, snakeweed, Mormon tea, Utah agave, banana and narrowleaf Yucca, winterfat, Indian ricegrass, dropseed, and needlegrass.
There are a variety of snakes and lizards here, but one species of reptile, the mountain short-horned Lizard, is a particularly abundant inhabitant of the piñon-juniper and ponderosa pine forests.Ponderosa pine forests grow at elevations between , on both North and South rims in the Transition life zone.
The South Rim includes species such as gray fox, mule deer, bighorn sheep, rock squirrels, pinyon pine and Utah juniper.
Additional species such as Gambel oak, New Mexico locust, mountain mahogany, elderberry, creeping mahonia, and fescue have been identified in these forests.
The Utah tiger salamander and the Great Basin spadefoot toad are two amphibians that are common in the rim forests.
Of the approximately 90 bird species that breed in the coniferous forests, 51 are summer residents and at least 15 of these are known to be neotropical migrants.
What agency oversees the conversation of Mount Rushmore?
The ongoing conservation of the site is overseen by the US National Park Service.
Physical efforts to conserve the monument have included replacement of the sealant applied originally by Gutzon Borglum, which had proved ineffective at providing water resistance (components include linseed oil, granite dust and white lead).
A modern silicone replacement was used, disguised with granite dust.In 1998, electronic monitoring devices were installed to track movement in the topology of the sculpture to an accuracy of 3 mm.
The site has been subsequently digitally recorded using a terrestrial laser scanning methodology in 2009 as part of the international Scottish Ten project, providing a record of unprecedented resolution and accuracy to inform the conservation of the site.
This data was made accessible online to be freely used by the wider community to aid further interpretation and public access.
Who introduced the hourglass profile of the tower?
The architecture of the Space Needle is the result of a compromise between the designs of two men, Edward E. Carlson and John Graham, Jr.
The two leading ideas for the World Fair involved businessman Edward Carlson's sketch of a giant balloon tethered to the ground (see the gently sloping base) and architect John Graham's concept of a flying saucer (see the halo that houses the restaurant and observation deck).
Victor Steinbrueck introduced the hourglass profile of the tower.
The Space Needle was built to withstand wind speeds of 200 mph, double the requirements in the building code of 1962.
An earthquake registering 6.8 on the Richter Scale jolted the Needle enough in 2001 for water to slosh out of the toilets in the restrooms.
The Space Needle can endure serious structural damage during earthquakes of magnitudes below 9.
Also made to withstand Category 5 hurricane-force winds, the Space Needle sways only 1 inch per 10 mph (16 mm per 10 km/h) of wind speed.For decades, the "hovering disk" of the Space Needle was home to two restaurants above the ground: the Space Needle Restaurant, which was originally named Eye of the Needle, and Emerald Suite.
These were closed in 2000 to make way for SkyCity, a larger restaurant that features Pacific Northwest cuisine.
It rotates 360 degrees in exactly forty-seven minutes.
In 1993, the elevators were replaced with new computerized versions.
The new elevators descend at a rate of .On December 31, 1999 (New Year's Eve), a powerful beam of light was unveiled for the first time.
Called the Legacy Light or Skybeam, it is powered by lamps that total 85 million candela shining skyward from the top of the Space Needle to honor national holidays and special occasions in Seattle.
The concept of this beam was derived from the official 1962 World's Fair poster, which depicted such a light source although none was incorporated into the original design.
It is somewhat controversial because of the light pollution it creates.
Originally planned to be turned on 75 nights per year, it has generally been used fewer than a dozen times per year.
It did remain lit for eleven days in a row from September 11, 2001, to September 22, 2001, in response to the September 11, 2001 attacks.The same 1962 World's Fair original poster showed a grand spiral entryway leading to the elevator, but this, too, was omitted from the final building plans.
This stairway was added as part of the Pavilion and Spacebase addition/remodel in June 2000.
The main stairwell (generally emergency access) has 848 steps in all from the basement to the top of the observation deck.At approximately , the Space Needle was the tallest building west of the Mississippi River at the time it was built by Howard S. Wright Construction Co., but is now dwarfed by other structures along the Seattle skyline, among them the Columbia Center, at .
Unlike many other similar structures, such as the CN Tower in Toronto, the Space Needle is not used for broadcasting purposes.
What year did the government cede the islands in New York?
Access and attributes.Location and visiting.The statue is situated in Upper New York Bay on Liberty Island, south of Ellis Island.
Both islands were ceded by New York to the federal government in 1800.
As agreed in an 1834 compact between New York and New Jersey that set the state border at the bay's midpoint, the original islands remain New York territory despite their location on the New Jersey side of the state line.
Land created by reclamation at Ellis is New Jersey territory.No charge is made for entrance to Statue of Liberty National Monument, but there is a cost for the ferry service that all visitors must use, as private boats may not dock at the island.
A concession was granted in 2007 to Statue Cruises to operate the transportation and ticketing facilities, replacing Circle Line, which had operated the service since 1953.The ferries, which depart from Liberty State Park in Jersey City and Battery Park in Lower Manhattan, also stop at Ellis Island when it is open to the public, making a combined trip possible.
All ferry riders are subject to security screening, similar to airport procedures, prior to boarding.
Visitors intending to enter the statue's base and pedestal must obtain a complimentary museum/pedestal ticket along with their ferry ticket.
Those wishing to climb the staircase within the statue to the crown purchase a special ticket, which may be reserved up to a year in advance.
A total of 240 people per day are permitted to ascend: ten per group, three groups per hour.
Climbers may bring only medication and cameras—lockers are provided for other items—and must undergo a second security screening.
In what year was Sea World opened?
SeaWorld was opened in 1964 by Milton C. Shedd, Ken Norris, David Demott, and George Millay.
The four graduates of UCLA originally set out to build an underwater restaurant and marine life show.
When the underwater restaurant concept was deemed unfeasible, they scrapped those plans and decided to build a park instead, and SeaWorld San Diego was opened on March 21, 1964.
With only a few dolphins, sea lions, 6 attractions and , the park proved to be a success and more than 400,000 guests visited in the first 12 months.After considering other locations in the midwest, including the Lake Milton/Newton Falls area west of Youngstown, Ohio, it was decided that Aurora, Ohio would be the new home of a SeaWorld.
The Aurora site was approximately northwest of the Lake Milton site, and southeast of Cleveland.
By this time the founders of the company had captured a few more species of animals, including a killer whale that was brought to the new facility.
The harsh winter climate permitted the park to be open only from mid-May until mid-September.The Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida opened near the end of the second operating season of SeaWorld of Ohio.
The success of Disney in Orlando provided a location that was already popular with tourists.
SeaWorld Orlando opened in 1973.Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc. (HBJ) purchased the company in 1976 and 12 years later they began a venture in Texas.
In 1988, SeaWorld San Antonio opened just a few miles outside of San Antonio.
Growth has pushed the city outwards, and now SeaWorld San Antonio lies in the Westover Hills community in West San Antonio.
The park was open year-round like its sister parks in California and Florida in 1988 and 1989, then went to a seasonal schedule.
The stress and financial resources it took to build and maintain a state-of-the-art marine mammal facility in the late '80s eventually took its toll on the company.
HBJ, whose primary focus was producing school books, needed to reduce its assets in order to avoid a bankruptcy.The Anheuser-Busch Company made an offer to purchase the SeaWorld parks.
However, HBJ also owned and operated two other parks, Cypress Gardens and Boardwalk and Baseball, and out of fear of not being able to find a buyer for the two other parks, HBJ refused to sell the parks individually.
Despite a long negotiation, Anheuser-Busch bought all six parks in 1989: SeaWorld in San Diego, Aurora, Orlando and San Antonio as well as Cypress Gardens in Winter Haven and Boardwalk and Baseball in Haines City.
Soon after the sale was final, Busch sold Cypress Gardens to the park's management and closed Boardwalk and Baseball.
Anheuser-Busch put millions of dollars back into the parks to revive and to prolong their longevity.
What is the name of the oldest operating coaster in the park?
This section was named after the oldest operating coaster in the park, Comet, and lies along Spring Creek.
This is one of the oldest areas part of Hersheypark; many rides have come and gone in this area.
The park's first water ride, the Mill Chute installed in 1929, was alongside the creek where Great Bear runs today.
The original location for the bumper cars, then called the Auto Skooters, is now the SooperDooperLooper Sandwich Stop.
There were giant slides on the hill where the Hersheypark Amphitheater is located.
A turnpike ride was located underneath the high bridge that crossed Spring Creek to Minetown.
The park's carousel, before being moved to Carrousel Circle in 1972, was located along the creek adjacent to the station of Comet.
Before SooperDooperLooper came to Comet Hollow in 1977, a Himalaya ride was in that location, and before that, twin Eli Bridge Ferris wheels.
A whip, and a station for the Electric Railroad were also located in Comet Hollow at one time.One of Hersheypark's most significant floods occurred in 1972 as a result of Hurricane Agnes.
A number of rides were heavily damaged or destroyed as a result.
These rides include the turnpike ride, the Mill Chute and the giant slides.
They were eventually replaced (the Coal Cracker (1973) and Twin Turnpike (1975) were put on higher ground in Minetown, and the Merry Derry Dip Fun Slide was put in Midway America twenty five years later in 1997).Today, Comet Hollow features three roller coasters, Comet (Hersheypark), Skyrush, and the first looping roller coaster on the East Coast, SooperDooperLooper.
It also houses the Wave Swinger.
Almost all of Great Bear's track courses through Comet Hollow.Beginning with the 2012 season and renovations being done to this area, the park changed the name of the once 'Comet Hollow' to the now present name of 'The Hollow'.
What year did construction of Six Flags Over Texas start?
History.Beginnings.The name refers to the flags of the six different nations that have governed Texas: Spain, France, Mexico, the Republic of Texas, the United States of America, and the Confederate States of America.
The original park was (and still is) split into separate regions, such as the "Spain and Mexico" section which featured Spanish-themed rides, attractions, and buildings.The Six Flags chain originated in 1959 with the creation of "The Great Southwest Corporation" by Angus G. Wynne and other investors.
Construction of "Six Flags Over Texas" started in 1960, and the park was opened the next year for a short (45-day) season.
The first park initially featured a Native American village, a gondola ride, a railroad, some Wild West shows, a stagecoach ride, and "Skull Island", a pirate-themed adventure attraction.
There was also an excursion, inspired by the historical La Salle Expeditions in the late 1600s, called "LaSalle's River Adventure", aboard French riverboats through a wilderness full of animated puppets.
Over time, all of those attractions, except for the railroad, would be replaced by others, such as roller coasters, swing rides, log flumes, and shoot-the-chute rides, as well as an observation tower.
Which phase saw rearrangement of the bluestones?
 3 IV (2280 BC to 1930 BC).This phase saw further rearrangement of the bluestones.
They were arranged in a circle between the two rings of sarsens and in an oval at the centre of the inner ring.
Some archaeologists argue that some of these bluestones were from a second group brought from Wales.
All the stones formed well-spaced uprights without any of the linking lintels inferred in Stonehenge 3 III.
The Altar Stone may have been moved within the oval at this time and re-erected vertically.
Although this would seem the most impressive phase of work, Stonehenge 3 IV was rather shabbily built compared to its immediate predecessors, as the newly re-installed bluestones were not well-founded and began to fall over.
However, only minor changes were made after this phase.
How many people could the Colosseum hold?
The Colosseum or Coliseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: "Amphitheatrum Flavium"; Italian: "Anfiteatro Flavio" or "Colosseo") is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy.
Built of concrete and stone, it was the largest amphitheatre of the Roman Empire, and is considered one of the greatest works of Roman architecture and engineering.
It is the largest amphitheatre in the world.The Colosseum is situated just east of the Roman Forum.
Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in 70 AD, and was completed in 80 AD under his successor and heir Titus.
Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (81–96).
These three emperors are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named in Latin for its association with their family name "(Flavius)".The Colosseum could hold, it is estimated, between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators, and was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as mock sea battles, animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology.
The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era.
It was later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.Although in the 21st century it stays partially ruined because of damage caused by devastating earthquakes and stone-robbers, the Colosseum is an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome.
It is one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions and has close connections with the Roman Catholic Church, as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit "Way of the Cross" procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum.The Colosseum, like all the Historic Centre of Rome, Properties of the Holy See in Italy and the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls, was listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1980.
In 2007 the complex was also included among the New7Wonders of the World, following a competition organized by New Open World Corporation (NOWC).The Colosseum is also depicted on the Italian version of the five-cent euro coin.
Who is the person that is portrayed in Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa?
The Mona Lisa (Monna Lisa or La Gioconda in Italian; La Joconde in French) is a half-length portrait of a woman by the Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci, which has been acclaimed as "the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world.
"The painting, thought to be a portrait of Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, is in oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel, and is believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506, although Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517.
It was acquired by King Francis I of France and is now the property of the French Republic, on permanent display at The Louvre museum in Paris since 1797.
The ambiguity of the subject's expression, which is frequently described as enigmatic, the monumentality of the composition, the subtle modeling of forms and the atmospheric illusionism were novel qualities that have contributed to the continuing fascination and study of the work.
Where is the "Sunset at Montmajour" currently displayed?
Legacy.Posthumous fame.Following his first exhibitions in the late 1880s, Van Gogh's fame grew steadily among colleagues, art critics, dealers and collectors.
After his death, memorial exhibitions were mounted in Brussels, Paris, The Hague and Antwerp.
In the early 20th century, there were retrospectives in Paris (1901 and 1905), and Amsterdam (1905), and important group exhibitions in Cologne (1912), New York (1913) and Berlin (1914).
These had a noticeable impact on later generations of artists.
By the mid 20th century Van Gogh was seen as one of the greatest and most recognizable painters in history.
In 2007 a group of Dutch historians compiled the "Canon of Dutch History" to be taught in schools and included Van Gogh as one of the fifty topics of the canon, alongside other national icons such as Rembrandt and De Stijl.Together with those of Pablo Picasso, Van Gogh's works are among the world's most expensive paintings ever sold, based on data from auctions and private sales.
Those sold for over US$100 million (today's equivalent) include Portrait of Dr. Gachet, Portrait of Joseph Roulin and Irises.
A Wheatfield with Cypresses was sold in 1993 for US$57 million, a spectacularly high price at the time, while his Self Portrait with Bandaged Ear was sold privately in the late 1990s for an estimated US$80/$90 million.A newly discovered painting by the Dutch artist was publicly unveiled on September 10, 2013, after it was retrieved from the attic of a Norwegian collector who misjudged the work as a fraud following its purchase in 1908.
"Sunset at Montmajour" is a large oil landscape painting and, as of September 24, 2013, is displayed at Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum.
Who wrote the book "Natural History"?
The Great Sphinx is one of the world's largest and oldest statues but basic facts about it, such as when it was built, and by whom, are still debated.
These questions have resulted in the popular idea of the "Riddle of the Sphinx," alluding to the original Greek legend of the Riddle of the Sphinx.
Pliny The Elder mentioned the Great Sphinx in his book, "Natural History", commenting that the Egyptians looked upon the statue as a "divinity" that has been passed over in silence and "that King Harmais was buried in it".
What village is shown in the center part of the painting under a swirling sky?
The center part shows the village of Saint-Rémy under a swirling sky, in a view from the asylum towards north.
The Alpilles far to the right fit to this view, but there is little rapport of the actual scene with the intermediary hills which seem to be derived from a different part of the surroundings, south of the asylum.
The cypress tree to the left was added into the composition.
Of note is the fact Van Gogh had already, during his time in Arles, repositioned Ursa Major from the north to the south in his painting "Starry Night Over the Rhone".In a letter to his brother Theo, Van Gogh wrote of it: 
How did Sotheby's auctioneer Tobias Meyer describe "The Scream"?
The 1895 pastel-on-board version of the painting, owned by Norwegian businessman Petter Olsen, sold at Sotheby's for a record US$120 million at auction on 2 May 2012.
The bidding started at $40 million and lasted for over 12 minutes when Leon Black by phone gave the final offer of US$119,922,500, including the buyer's premium.
Sotheby's said the painting was the most colorful and vibrant of the four versions painted by Munch and the only version whose frame was hand-painted by the artist to include his poem, detailing the work's inspiration.
After the sale, Sotheby's auctioneer Tobias Meyer said the painting was "worth every penny", adding: "It is one of the great icons of art in the world and whoever bought it should be congratulated.
"The previous record for the most expensive work of art sold at auction had been held by Picasso's "Nude, Green Leaves and Bust", which went for US$106.5 million at Christie's two years prior on 4 May 2010.
When accounting for inflation, the highest price paid for art at an auction is still held by Van Gogh's "Portrait of Dr. Gachet", which sold for $82.5 million in 1990, or about $ million 2012 dollars.
There have been reports that "The Card Players", by Cézanne, sold privately for $250m in 2011, which can not be verified for the establishment of a record price.
Which insect did Dali often use in his paintings, and what did they symbolize?
The well-known surrealist piece introduced the image of the soft melting pocket watch.
It epitomizes Dalí's theory of "softness" and "hardness", which was central to his thinking at the time.
As Dawn Ades wrote, "The soft watches are an unconscious symbol of the relativity of space and time, a Surrealist meditation on the collapse of our notions of a fixed cosmic order".
This interpretation suggests that Dalí was incorporating an understanding of the world introduced by Albert Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity.
Asked by Ilya Prigogine whether this was in fact the case, Dalí replied that the soft watches were not inspired by the theory of relativity, but by the surrealist perception of a Camembert cheese melting in the sun.Although fundamentally part of Dalí's Freudian phase, the imagery precedes his transition to his scientific phase by fourteen years, which occurred after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.It is possible to recognize a human figure in the middle of the composition, in the strange "monster" that Dalí used in several contemporary pieces to represent himself – the abstract form becoming something of a self-portrait, reappearing frequently in his work.
The orange clock at the bottom left of the painting is covered in ants.
Dalí often used ants in his paintings as a symbol of decay.The figure in the middle of the picture can be read as a "fading" creature, one that often appears in dreams where the dreamer cannot pinpoint the creature's exact form and composition.
One can observe that the creature has one closed eye with several eyelashes, suggesting that the creature is also in a dream state.
The iconography may refer to a dream that Dalí himself had experienced, and the clocks may symbolize the passing of time as one experiences it in sleep or the persistence of time in the eyes of the dreamer .
"The Persistence of Memory" employs "the exactitude of realist painting techniques" to depict imagery more likely to be found in dreams than in waking consciousness.
Where did the last supper take place?
According to later tradition, the Last Supper took place in what is called today The Room of the Last Supper on Mount Zion, just outside of the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem, and is traditionally known as "The Upper Room".
This is based on the account in the Synoptic Gospels that states that Jesus had instructed a pair of unnamed disciples to go to "the city" to meet "a man carrying a jar of water", who would lead them to a house, where they would find "a large upper room furnished and ready".
In this upper room they "prepare the Passover".No more specific indication of the location is given in the New Testament, and the "city" referred to may be a suburb of Jerusalem, such as Bethany, rather than Jerusalem itself.
The traditional location is in an area that, according to archaeology, had a large Essene community, a point made by scholars who suspect a link between Jesus and the group (Kilgallen 265).Saint Mark's Syrian Orthodox Church in Jerusalem is another possible site for the room in which the Last Supper was held, and contains a Christian stone inscription testifying to early reverence for that spot.
Certainly the room they have is older than that of the current coenaculum (crusader - 12th century) and as the room is now underground the relative altitude is correct (the streets of 1st century Jerusalem were at least twelve feet (3.6 metres) lower than those of today, so any true building of that time would have even its upper storey currently under the earth).
They also have a revered Icon of the Virgin Mary, reputedly painted from life by St Luke.Bargil Pixner claims the original site is located beneath the current structure of the Cenacle on Mount Zion.
Which museum owns "American Gothic"?
American Gothic is a painting by Grant Wood in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago.
Wood's inspiration came from what is now known as the American Gothic House, and his decision to paint the house along with "the kind of people I fancied should live in that house."
The painting shows a farmer standing beside his spinster daughter.
The figures were modeled by the artist's sister and their dentist.
The woman is dressed in a colonial print apron evoking 19th-century Americana, and the couple are in the traditional roles of men and women, the man's pitchfork symbolizing hard labor, and the flowers over the woman's right shoulder suggesting domesticity.It is one of the most familiar images in 20th-century American art, and has been widely parodied in American popular culture.
Who obtained the painting in the 1940s?
The canvas (50 ½ by 37 ½ inches / 128.3 cm by 95.3 cm) was one of many portraits of Dora Maar painted by Pablo Picasso over their nearly decade-long relationship.
Picasso fell in love with the 29-year old Maar at the age of 55 and soon began living with her.
This painting was done during the year 1941, when the Nazis were occupying France.
In the 1940s, the painting was obtained by Chicago collectors Leigh and Mary Block.
They sold the painting in 1963 After that, the painting was never shown until the 21st century.During 2005 and 2006, "Dora Maar au Chat", then owned by the Gidwitz family of Chicago, was shown worldwide as part of Sotheby's exhibitions in London, Hong Kong and New York.
It came up for sale in an auction of Impressionist/Modern works held at Sotheby's on May 3, 2006 in New York and making it the second-highest price ever paid for a painting at auction.
An anonymous Russian bidder present at the New York auction won the work with a final bid of US$95,216,000, well exceeding the pre-auction US$50 million estimates.
The identity of the bidder, who spent more than US$100 million in total, and purchased an 1883 Monet seascape and a 1978 Chagall in addition to the Picasso, was a topic of much speculation.
Apparently a novice bidder, though possibly acting as an agent for a more well-known collector, the anonymous buyer may have been unknown at the start of the auction even to Sotheby's officials.
As of mid-2007, the ownership of the "Dora Maar au Chat" is still unknown to the general public, although rumors have focused on the Georgian mining magnate and current Prime Minister of Georgia Bidzina (Boris) Ivanishvili, who sold his Moscow bank a week before the auction for $550 m.
In what 1986 comedy is the painting featured in?
The January 1974 "Playboy" magazine featured Nancy Cameron, its Playmate of the Month, on its cover superimposed on the painting in similar style.The painting was the basis for the 1984 Broadway musical "Sunday In The Park With George" by Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine.
Subsequently the painting is sometimes referred to by the misnomer ""Sunday in the Park"".The painting is prominently featured in the 1986 comedy film "Ferris Bueller's Day Off".At the Old Deaf School Park in Columbus, Ohio, sculptor James T. Mason recreated the painting in topiary form; the installation was completed in 1989.The painting was the inspiration for the commemorative poster printed for the 1993 Detroit Belle Isle Grand Prix, with racing cars and the Detroit skyline added.The painting was featured, among others, in a scene from "".
It also featured in an episode of Family Guy, when Stewie visits an art museum; both times a parody of the famous "Ferris Bueller" sequence.
What is synthetic cubism?
Analytic cubism (1909–1912) is a style of painting Picasso developed with Georges Braque using monochrome brownish and neutral colours.
Both artists took apart objects and "analyzed" them in terms of their shapes.
Picasso and Braque's paintings at this time share many similarities.
Synthetic cubism (1912–1919) was a further development of the genre, in which cut paper fragments – often wallpaper or portions of newspaper pages – were pasted into compositions, marking the first use of collage in fine art.In Paris, Picasso entertained a distinguished coterie of friends in the Montmartre and Montparnasse quarters, including André Breton, poet Guillaume Apollinaire, writer Alfred Jarry, and Gertrude Stein.
Apollinaire was arrested on suspicion of stealing the "Mona Lisa" from the Louvre in 1911.
Apollinaire pointed to his friend Picasso, who was also brought in for questioning, but both were later exonerated.
In what year did Michelangelo create "Taddeo Tondo"?
Works.Madonna and Child.The "Madonna of the Steps" is Michelangelo's earliest known work.
It is carved in shallow relief, a technique often employed by the master-sculptor of the early 15th-century, Donatello and others such as Desiderio da Settignano.
While the Madonna is in profile, the easiest aspect for a shallow relief, the child displays a twisting motion that was to become characteristic of Michelangelo's work.
The "Taddeo Tondo" of 1502, shows the Christ Child frightened by a Bullfinch, a symbol of the Crucifixion.
The lively form of the child was later adapted by Raphael in the "Bridgewater Madonna".
The "Bruges Madonna" was, at the time of its creation, unlike other such statues which show the Virgin proudly presenting her son.
Here, the Christ Child, restrained by his mother's clasping hand, is about to step off into the world.
The "Doni Tondo", depicting the Holy Family, has elements of all three previous works: the frieze of figures in the background has the appearance of a low-relief, while the circular shape and dynamic forms echo the Taddeo Tondo.
The twisting motion present in the Bruges Madonna is accentuated in the painting.
The painting heralds the forms, movement and colour that Michelangelo was to employ on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.
Where is da Vinci buried?
From September 1513 to 1516, under Pope Leo X, Leonardo spent much of his time living in the Belvedere in the Vatican in Rome, where Raphael and Michelangelo were both active at the time.
In October 1515, Francis I of France recaptured Milan.
On December 19, Leonardo was present at the meeting of Francis I and Pope Leo X, which took place in Bologna.
Leonardo was commissioned to make for Francis a mechanical lion which could walk forward, then open its chest to reveal a cluster of lilies.
In 1516, he entered François' service, being given the use of the manor house Clos Lucé near the king's residence at the royal Château d'Amboise.
It was here that he spent the last three years of his life, accompanied by his friend and apprentice, Count Francesco Melzi, and supported by a pension totalling 10,000 scudi.Leonardo died at Clos Lucé, on May 2, 1519.
Francis I had become a close friend.
Vasari records that the king held Leonardo's head in his arms as he died, although this story, beloved by the French and portrayed in romantic paintings by Ingres, Ménageot and other French artists, as well as by Angelica Kauffman, may be legend rather than fact.
Vasari states that in his last days, Leonardo sent for a priest to make his confession and to receive the Holy Sacrament.
In accordance with his will, sixty beggars followed his casket.
Melzi was the principal heir and executor, receiving as well as money, Leonardo's paintings, tools, library and personal effects.
Leonardo also remembered his other long-time pupil and companion, Salai and his servant Battista di Vilussis, who each received half of Leonardo's vineyards, his brothers who received land, and his serving woman who received a black cloak "of good stuff" with a fur edge.
Leonardo da Vinci was buried in the Chapel of Saint-Hubert in Château d'Amboise, in France.Some 20 years after Leonardo's death, Francis was reported by the goldsmith and sculptor Benevenuto Cellini as saying: "There had never been another man born in the world who knew as much as Leonardo, not so much about painting, sculpture and architecture, as that he was a very great philosopher."
In what year was "Saint George" completed?
In Florence, Donatello assisted Lorenzo Ghiberti with the statues of prophets for the north door of the Florence Baptistery, for which he received payment in November 1406 and early 1408.
In 1409–1411 he executed the colossal seated figure of "Saint John the Evangelist", which until 1588 occupied a niche of the old cathedral façade, and is now placed in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo.
This work marks a decisive step forward from late Gothic Mannerism in the search for naturalism and the rendering of human feelings.
The face, the shoulders and the bust are still idealized, while the hands and the fold of cloth over the legs are more realistic.In 1411–1413, Donatello worked on a statue of St. Mark for the guild church of Orsanmichele.
In 1417 he completed the "Saint George" for the Confraternity of the Cuirass-makers.
The elegant "St. George and the Dragon" relief on the statue's base, executed in schiacciato (a very low bas-relief) is one of the first examples of central-point perspective in sculpture.
From 1423 is the "Saint Louis of Toulouse" for the Orsanmichele, now in the Museum of the Basilica di Santa Croce.
Donatello had also sculpted the classical frame for this work, which remains, while the statue was moved in 1460 and replaced by "Incredulity of Saint Thomas" by Verrocchio.Between 1415 and 1426, Donatello created five statues for the campanile of Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence, also known as the Duomo.
These works are the "Beardless Prophet"; "Bearded Prophet" (both from 1415); the "Sacrifice of Isaac" (1421); "Habbakuk" (1423–1425); and "Jeremiah" (1423–1426); which follow the classical models for orators and are characterized by strong portrait details.
From the late teens is the "Pazzi Madonna" relief in Berlin.
In 1425, he executed the notable "Crucifix" for Santa Croce; this work portrays Christ in a moment of the agony, eyes and mouth partially opened, the body contracted in an ungraceful posture.From 1425–1427, Donatello collaborated with Michelozzo on the funerary monument of the Antipope John XXIII for the Battistero in Florence.
Donatello made the recumbent bronze figure of the deceased, under a shell.
In 1427, he completed in Pisa a marble relief for the funerary monument of Cardinal Rainaldo Brancacci at the church of Sant'Angelo a Nilo in Naples.
In the same period, he executed the relief of the "Feast of Herod" and the statues of "Faith" and "Hope" for the Baptistery of San Giovanni in Siena.
The relief is mostly in "stiacciato", with the foreground figures are done in bas-relief.
In what year was the first large-scale bronze casting initially presented to the public?
"The Thinker" has been cast in multiple versions and is found around the world; the history of the progression from models to castings is complicated and still not entirely clear.
About 28 monumental-sized bronze casts of the sculpture are in museums and public places.
In addition, there are sculptures of different study size scales and plaster versions (often painted bronze) in both monumental and study sizes.
Some newer castings have been produced posthumously and are not considered part of the original production.Rodin made the first small plaster version around 1880.
The first large-scale bronze casting was finished in 1902 but not presented to the public until 1904.
It became the property of the city of Paris — thanks to a subscription organized by Rodin admirers — and was put in front of the Panthéon in 1906.
In 1922, it was moved to the Hôtel Biron, which had been transformed into the Rodin Museum.The first cast sculpture can be found in front of Grawemeyer Hall on the University of Louisville Belknap Campus in Louisville, Kentucky.
Made in Paris, it was first displayed at the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904 and was then given to the city.
This sculpture was the only cast created by the lost-wax casting method.
In what year was Moore given a commission from the Church of St. Matthew, Northampton to carve a Madonna and Child?
At the outbreak of the Second World War the Chelsea School of Art was evacuated to Northampton and Moore resigned his teaching post.
During the war, Moore produced powerful drawings of Londoners sleeping in the London Underground while sheltering from the Blitz.
Kenneth Clark, the chairman of the War Artists' Advisory Committee,WAAC, had previously tried to recruit Moore as a full-time salaried war artist and now agreed to purchase some of the shelter drewings and issued contracts for further examples.
The shelter drawings WAAC acquired were completed between the autumn of 1940 and the spring of 1941 and are regarded as among the finest products of the WAAC scheme.
In August 1941 WAAC commissioned Moore to drew miners working underground at the Wheldale Colliery in Yorkshire, where his father had worked at the start of the century.
Whereas Moore drew the people in the shelters as passively waiting the all-clear he shows the miners aggressively working the coal-faces.
These drawings helped to boost Moore's international reputation, particularly in America where examples were included in the WAAC "Britain at War" exhibition which toured North America throughout the war.After their Hampstead home was hit by bomb shrapnel in September 1940, Moore and Irina moved out of London to live in a farmhouse called Hoglands in the hamlet of Perry Green near Much Hadham, Hertfordshire.
This was to become Moore's home and workshop for the rest of his life.
Despite acquiring significant wealth later in life, Moore never felt the need to move to larger premises and, apart from the addition of a number of outbuildings and studios, the house changed little over the years.
In 1943 he received a commission from the Church of St. Matthew, Northampton, to carve a Madonna and Child; this sculpture was the first in an important series of family-group sculptures.
What was the date and time of Warhol's death in New York City?
Warhol died in New York City at 6:32 am on February 22, 1987.
According to news reports, he had been making good recovery from a routine gallbladder surgery at New York Hospital before dying in his sleep from a sudden post-operative cardiac arrhythmia.
Prior to his diagnosis and operation, Warhol delayed having his recurring gallbladder problems checked, as he was afraid to enter hospitals and see doctors.
His family sued the hospital for inadequate care, saying that the arrhythmia was caused by improper care and water intoxication.
The malpractice case was quickly settled out of court; Warhol's family received an undisclosed sum of money.Warhol's body was taken back to Pittsburgh by his brothers for burial.
The wake was at Thomas P. Kunsak Funeral Home and was an open-coffin ceremony.
The coffin was a solid bronze casket with gold plated rails and white upholstery.
Warhol was dressed in a black cashmere suit, a paisley tie, a platinum wig, and sunglasses.
He was posed holding a small prayer book and a red rose.
The funeral liturgy was held at the Holy Ghost Byzantine Catholic Church on Pittsburgh's North Side.
The eulogy was given by Monsignor Peter Tay.
Yoko Ono and John Richardson were speakers.
The coffin was covered with white roses and asparagus ferns.
After the liturgy, the coffin was driven to St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cemetery in Bethel Park, a south suburb of Pittsburgh.At the grave, the priest said a brief prayer and sprinkled holy water on the casket.
Before the coffin was lowered, Paige Powell dropped a copy of "Interview" magazine, an "Interview" T-shirt, and a bottle of the Estee Lauder perfume "Beautiful" into the grave.
Warhol was buried next to his mother and father.
A memorial service was held in Manhattan for Warhol on April 1, 1987, at St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York.

What mental illness do historians hypotesize that Jackson Pollock may have had?
Pollock was born in Cody, Wyoming, in 1912, the youngest of five sons.
His parents, Stella May (née McClure) and LeRoy Pollock, were born and grew up in Tingley, Iowa and were educated at Tingley High School.
Pollock's mother is interred at Tingley Cemetery, Ringgold County, Iowa.
His father had been born with the surname McCoy but took the surname of his adoptive parents, neighbors who adopted him after his own parents had died within a year of each other.
Stella and LeRoy Pollock were Presbyterian; they were of Irish and Scots-Irish descent, respectively.
LeRoy Pollock was a farmer and later a land surveyor for the government, moving for different jobs.
Jackson grew up in Arizona and Chico, California.While living in Echo Park, California, he enrolled at Los Angeles' Manual Arts High School, from which he was expelled.
He already had been expelled in 1928 from another high school.
During his early life, Pollock explored Native American culture while on surveying trips with his father.In 1930, following his older brother Charles Pollock, he moved to New York City, where they both studied under Thomas Hart Benton at the Art Students League.
Benton's rural American subject matter had little influence on Pollock's work, but his rhythmic use of paint and his fierce independence were more lasting.
From 1938 to 1942, during the Great Depression, Pollock worked for the WPA Federal Art Project.Trying to deal with his established alcoholism, from 1938 through 1941 Pollock underwent Jungian psychotherapy with Dr. Joseph Henderson and later with Dr. Violet Staub de Laszlo in 1941-1942.
Henderson engaged him through his art, encouraging Pollock to make drawings.
Jungian concepts and archetypes were expressed in his paintings.
Recently historians have hypothesized that Pollock might have had bipolar disorder.

Where are the FIFA headquarters located?
The recognised international governing body of football (and associated games, such as futsal and beach soccer) is FIFA.
The FIFA headquarters are located in Zurich.
Six regional confederations are associated with FIFA; these are:
 Asia: Asian Football Confederation (AFC)
 Africa: Confederation of African Football (CAF)
 Europe: Union of European Football Associations (UEFA)
 North/Central America & Caribbean: Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF)
 Oceania: Oceania Football Confederation (OFC)
 South America: Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol/Confederação Sul-americana de Futebol (South American Football Confederation; CONMEBOL)
National associations oversee football within individual countries.
These are generally synonymous with sovereign states, (for example: the Fédération Camerounaise de Football in Cameroon) but also include a smaller number of associations responsible for sub-national entities or autonomous regions (for example the Scottish Football Association in Scotland).
208 national associations are affiliated both with FIFA and with their respective continental confederations.While FIFA is responsible for arranging competitions and most rules related to international competition, the actual Laws of the Game are set by the International Football Association Board, where each of the UK Associations has one vote, while FIFA collectively has four votes.
What is Auskick?
 Australian rules football — officially known as "Australian football", and informally as "football", "footy" or "Aussie rules".
In some areas it is referred to as "AFL", the name of the main organising body and competition
* Auskick — a version of Australian rules designed by the AFL for young children
* Metro footy (or Metro rules footy) — a modified version invented by the USAFL, for use on gridiron fields in North American cities (which often lack grounds large enough for conventional Australian rules matches)
* Kick-to-kick – informal versions of the game
* 9-a-side footy — a more open, running variety of Australian rules, requiring 18 players in total and a proportionally smaller playing area (includes contact and non-contact varieties)
* Rec footy — "Recreational Football", a modified non-contact variation of Australian rules, created by the AFL, which replaces tackles with tags
* Touch Aussie Rules — a non-contact variation of Australian Rules played only in the United Kingdom

What is the number of players on a MLB team's active roster?
Personnel.Player rosters.Roster, or squad, sizes differ between different leagues and different levels of organized play.
Major League Baseball teams maintain 25-player active rosters.
A typical 25-man roster in a league without the DH rule, such as MLB's National League, features:
eight position players—catcher, four infielders, three outfielders—who play on a regular basis
five starting pitchers who constitute the team's pitching rotation or starting rotation
six relief pitchers, including one specialist closer, who constitute the team's bullpen (named for the off-field area where pitchers warm up)
one backup, or substitute, catcher
two backup infielders
two backup outfielders
one specialist pinch hitter, or a second backup catcher, or a seventh reliever
What kind of violation is it if the feet hit the floor before the ball is released?
Shooting is the act of attempting to score points by throwing the ball through the basket, methods varying with players and situations.Typically, a player faces the basket with both feet facing the basket.
A player will rest the ball on the fingertips of the dominant hand (the shooting arm) slightly above the head, with the other hand supporting the side of the ball.
The ball is usually shot by jumping (though not always) and extending the shooting arm.
The shooting arm, fully extended with the wrist fully bent, is held stationary for a moment following the release of the ball, known as a "follow-through".
Players often try to put a steady backspin on the ball to absorb its impact with the rim.
The ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat controversial, but generally a proper arc is recommended.
Players may shoot directly into the basket or may use the backboard to redirect the ball into the basket.The two most common shots that use the above described setup are the "set-shot" and the "jump-shot".
The set-shot is taken from a standing position, with neither foot leaving the floor, typically used for free throws, and in other circumstances whilst the jump-shot is taken in mid-air, the ball released near the top of the jump.
This provides much greater power and range, and it also allows the player to elevate over the defender.
Failure to release the ball before the feet return to the floor is considered a traveling violation.Another common shot is called the "lay-up".
This shot requires the player to be in motion toward the basket, and to "lay" the ball "up" and into the basket, typically off the backboard (the backboard-free, underhand version is called a "finger roll").
The most crowd-pleasing and typically highest-percentage accuracy shot is the "slam dunk", in which the player jumps very high and throws the ball downward, through the basket whilst touching it.Another shot that is becoming common is the "circus shot".
The circus shot is a low-percentage shot that is flipped, heaved, scooped, or flung toward the hoop while the shooter is off-balance, airborne, falling down, and/or facing away from the basket.
A back-shot is a shot taken when the player is facing away from the basket, and may be shot with the dominant hand, or both; but there is a very low chance that the shot will be successful.A shot that misses both the rim and the backboard completely is referred to as an "air-ball".
A particularly bad shot, or one that only hits the backboard, is jocularly called a brick.
What are the only junior tennis tournaments that offer prize money?
In tennis, a junior is a player 18 and under who is still legally protected by a parent or guardian.
Players on the main adult tour who are under 18 must have documents signed by a parent or guardian.
These players, however, are still eligible to play in junior tournaments.The International Tennis Federation (ITF) conducts a junior tour that allows juniors to establish a world ranking and an Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) or Women's Tennis Association (WTA) ranking.
Most juniors who enter the international circuit do so by progressing through ITF, Satellite, Future, and Challenger tournaments before entering the main circuit.
The latter three circuits also have adults competing in them.
Some juniors, however, such as Australian Lleyton Hewitt and Frenchman Gaël Monfils, have catapulted directly from the junior tour to the ATP tour by dominating the junior scene or by taking advantage of opportunities given to them to participate in professional tournaments.In 2004, the ITF implemented a new rankings scheme to encourage greater participation in doubles, by combining two rankings (singles and doubles) into one combined tally.
Junior tournaments do not offer prize money except for the Grand Slam tournaments, which are the most prestigious junior events.
Juniors may earn income from tennis by participating in the Future, Satellite, or Challenger tours.
Tournaments are broken up into different tiers offering different amounts of ranking points, culminating with Grade A.Leading juniors are allowed to participate for their nation in the Junior Fed Cup and Davis Cup competitions.
To succeed in tennis often means having to begin playing at a young age.
To facilitate and nurture a junior's growth in tennis, almost all tennis playing nations have developed a junior development system.
Juniors develop their play through a range of tournaments on all surfaces, accommodating all different standards of play.
Talented juniors may also receive sponsorships from governing bodies or private institutions.
What is human swimming?
Human swimming is the self propulsion of a person through water or other liquid, for survival, recreation, sport, exercise or other reason.
Locomotion is achieved through coordinated movement of the limbs, the body, or both.
Humans are able to hold their breath underwater and undertake rudimentary locomotive swimming within weeks of birth, as an evolutionary response.Swimming is consistently found to be among the top recreational activities undertaken by the public, and in some countries, swimming lessons are a compulsory part of the educational curriculum.
As a formalized sport, swimming features in a range of local, national and international competitions, including featuring in every modern summer Olympics.
How is a error made?
When the ball contacts the floor within the court boundaries or an error is made, the team that did not make the error is awarded a point, whether they served the ball or not.
If the ball hits the line, the ball is counted as in.
The team that won the point serves for the next point.
If the team that won the point served in the previous point, the same player serves again.
If the team that won the point did not serve the previous point, the players of the team rotate their position on the court in a clockwise manner.
The game continues, with the first team to score 25 points by a two-point margin is awarded the set.
Matches are best-of-five sets and the fifth set, if necessary, is usually played to 15 points.
(Scoring differs between leagues, tournaments, and levels; high schools sometimes play best-of-three to 25; in the NCAA matches are played best-of-five to 25 as of the 2008 season.
)Before 1999, points could be scored only when a team had the serve ("side-out scoring") and all sets went up to only 15 points.
The FIVB changed the rules in 1999 (with the changes being compulsory in 2000) to use the current scoring system (formerly known as "rally point system"), primarily to make the length of the match more predictable and to make the game more spectator- and television-friendly.The final year of side-out scoring at the NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball Championship was 2000.
Rally point scoring debuted in 2001 and games were played to 30 points through 2007.
For the 2008 season, games were renamed "sets" and reduced to 25 points to win.
What is another name for a hole in one?
In every form of play, the goal is to play as few strokes per round as possible.
A golfer's score is usually expressed as the difference between the player's number of strokes and the par score.
A hole in one (or an "ace") occurs when a golfer sinks his ball into the cup with his first stroke from the tee.
Common scores for a hole also have specific terms.
What modern coaching resource is mentioned?
Badminton and tennis techniques differ substantially.
The lightness of the shuttlecock and of badminton rackets allow badminton players to make use of the wrist and fingers much more than tennis players; in tennis the wrist is normally held stable, and playing with a mobile wrist may lead to injury.
For the same reasons, badminton players can generate power from a short racket swing: for some strokes such as net kills, an elite player's swing may be less than .
For strokes that require more power, a longer swing will typically be used, but the badminton racket swing will rarely be as long as a typical tennis swing.It is often asserted that power in badminton strokes comes mainly from the wrist.
This is a misconception and may be criticised for two reasons.
First, it is strictly speaking a category error: the wrist is a joint, not a muscle; the forearm muscles control its movement.
Second, wrist movements are weak when compared to forearm or upper arm movements.
Badminton biomechanics have not been the subject of extensive scientific study, but some studies confirm the minor role of the wrist in power generation, and indicate that the major contributions to power come from internal and external rotations of the upper and lower arm.
Modern coaching resources such as the "Badminton England Technique DVD" reflect these ideas by emphasising forearm rotation rather than wrist movements.
What type of snow is usually found in big mountain snowboarding events?
A big mountain contest is one that takes place in open terrain, and challenges riders to find their way down the mountain with the most style and difficulty.
Big mountain events usually take place in powder snow conditions in closed off areas of resorts or in the backcountry.
There are a number of big mountain events in Europe, the United States and in New Zealand and this aspect of snowboarding competition is quickly rising in popularity.
Snowboarders consider Alaska the pinnacle of this style of riding, being featured in some of the most popular snowboarding videos and has given rise to one of the sport's most popular events, Tailgate Alaska, a yearly gathering of riders on Alaska's Thompson Pass.
What is fencing?
Fencing is the activity of fighting with swords.
The most common version of fencing today, also called olympic fencing or competitive fencing, is divided into three weapon categories: foil, sabre and épée.
Classical fencing uses the same three weapons, but approaches fencing as a martial art.Competitive fencing is one of five sports which has been featured at every one of the modern Olympic Games, the other four being Athletics, Cycling, Swimming, and Gymnastics.
What is Para-Archery?
Competitive archery involves shooting arrows at a target for accuracy from a set distance or distances.
This is the most popular form of competitive archery worldwide and is called target archery.
A form particularly popular in Europe and America is field archery, shot at targets generally set at various distances in a wooded setting.
Para-Archery is an adaptation of archery for athletes with a disability.
It is governed by the World Archery Federation (WA), and is one of the sports in the Summer Paralympic Games.
There are also several other lesser-known and historical forms of archery, as well as archery novelty games and flight archery, where the aim is to shoot the greatest distance.
What are some of the techniques utilized in wrestling?
Wrestling is a combat sport involving grappling type techniques such as clinch fighting, throws and takedowns, joint locks, pins and other grappling holds.
A wrestling bout is a physical competition, between two (occasionally more) competitors or sparring partners, who attempt to gain and maintain a superior position.
There are a wide range of styles with varying rules with both traditional historic and modern styles.
Wrestling techniques have been incorporated into other martial arts as well as military hand-to-hand combat systems.The term "wrestling" is attested in late Old English, as "wræstlunge" (glossing "palestram").
In what centuries were boxing bouts known to be motivated by money?
Throughout the 17th through 19th centuries, boxing bouts were motivated by money, as the fighters competed for prize money, promoters controlled the gate, and spectators bet on the result.
The modern Olympic movement revived interest in amateur sports, and amateur boxing became an Olympic sport in 1908.
In their current form, Olympic and other amateur bouts are typically limited to three or four rounds, scoring is computed by points based on the number of clean blows landed, regardless of impact, and fighters wear protective headgear, reducing the number of injuries, knockdowns, and knockouts.
Currently scoring blows in amateur boxing are subjectively counted by ringside judges, but the Australian Institute for Sport has demonstrated a prototype of an Automated Boxing Scoring System, which introduces scoring objectivity, improves safety, and arguably makes the sport more interesting to spectators.
Professional boxing remains by far the most popular form of the sport globally, though amateur boxing is dominant in Cuba and some former Soviet republics.
For most fighters, an amateur career, especially at the Olympics, serves to develop skills and gain experience in preparation for a professional career.
What is soaking the lower half of the body said to do?
Marathon participation may result in various medical, musculoskeletal, and dermatological complaints.
Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is a common condition affecting runners during the first week following a marathon.
Various types of mild exercise or massage have been recommended to alleviate pain secondary to DOMS.
Dermatological issues frequently include "jogger's nipple", "jogger's toe", and blisters.The immune system is reportedly suppressed for a short time.
Changes to the blood chemistry may lead physicians to mistakenly diagnose heart malfunction.After long training runs and the marathon itself, consuming carbohydrates to replace glycogen stores and protein to aid muscle recovery is commonly recommended.
In addition, soaking the lower half of the body for approximately 20 minutes in cold or ice water may force blood through the leg muscles to speed recovery.
What year was Taekwondo accepted as a Commonwealth Games sport?
American Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) competitions are very similar, except that different styles of pads and gear are allowed.Apart from WTF and ITF tournaments, major taekwondo competitions (all featuring WTF taekwondo only) include:
 Olympic Games
 Universiade
 Asian Games
 South East Asian Games
 South Asian Games
WTF taekwondo features in all multi-sport games except the Small Island Games.
It was accepted as a Commonwealth Games sport in June 2010.
What is a marksman?
Shooting is the act or process of firing firearms or other projectile weapons such as bows or crossbows.
Even the firing of artillery, rockets, and missiles can be called shooting.
A person who specializes in shooting is a marksman.
Shooting can take place in a shooting range or in the field in hunting, in shooting sports, or in combat.
What kind of techniques did Kano reject?
 versus Jujutsu.Central to Kano's vision for judo were the principles of and .
He illustrated the application of "seiryoku zen'yō" with the concept of :Kano realised that "seiryoku zen'yō", initially conceived as a Jujutsu concept, had a wider philosophical application.
Coupled with the Confucianist-influenced "jita kyōei", the wider application shaped the development of judo from a to a .
Kano rejected techniques that did not conform to these principles and emphasised the importance of efficiency in the execution of techniques.
He was convinced that practice of Jujutsu while conforming to these ideals was a route to self-improvement and the betterment of society in general.
He was, however, acutely conscious of the Japanese public's negative perception of Jujutsu:Kano believed that ""Jūjutsu"" was insufficient to describe his art: although means "art" or "means", it implies a method consisting of a collection of physical techniques.
Accordingly, he changed the second character to , meaning way, road or path, which implies a more philosophical context than "jutsu" and has a common origin with the Chinese concept of "tao".
Thus Kano renamed it .
What is the objective of the defensive chop?
A chop is the defensive, backspin counterpart to the offensive loop drive.
A chop is essentially a bigger, heavier push, taken well back from the table.
The racket face points primarily horizontally, perhaps a little bit upward, and the direction of the stroke is straight down.
The object of a defensive chop is to match the topspin of the opponent's shot with backspin.
A good chop will float nearly horizontally back to the table, in some cases having so much backspin that the ball actually "rises".
Such a chop can be "extremely" difficult to return due to its enormous amount of backspin.
Some defensive players can also impart no-spin or sidespin variations of the chop.
How many Olympic games have taken place in the US?
The market for professional sports in the United States is roughly $69 billion, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.
Baseball has been regarded as the national sport since the late 19th century, while American football is now by several measures the most popular spectator sport.
Basketball and ice hockey are the country's next two leading professional team sports.
These four major sports, when played professionally, each occupy a season at different, but overlapping, times of the year.
College football and basketball attract large audiences.
Boxing and horse racing were once the most watched individual sports, but they have been eclipsed by golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR.
In the 21st century, televised mixed martial arts has also gained a strong following of regular viewers.
While soccer is less popular in the United States than in many other nations, the men's national soccer team has been to the past six World Cups and the women are #1 in the women's world rankings.While most major U.S. sports have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, snowboarding, and cheerleading are American inventions, some of which have become popular in other countries.
Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate Western contact.
Eight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States.
The United States has won 2,400 medals at the Summer Olympic Games, more than any other country, and 281 in the Winter Olympic Games, the second most by 2014.
What percentage of ethnic minorities does China have?
China officially recognizes 56 distinct ethnic groups, the largest ofwhich are the Han Chinese, who constitute about 91.51% of the totalpopulation.
The Han Chinese – the world's largest single ethnic group – outnumber other ethnic groups in every provincial-level division except Tibet and Xinjiang.
Ethnic minorities account for about 8.49% of the population of China, according tothe 2010 census.
Compared with the 2000 population census, the Han population increased by 66,537,177 persons, or 5.74%, while the population of the 55 national minorities combined increased by 7,362,627 persons, or 6.92%.
The 2010 census recorded a total of 593,832 foreign citizens living in China.
The largest such groups were from South Korea (120,750), theUnited States (71,493) and Japan (66,159).
How many national parks are in Russia?
Russia is the largest country in the world; its total area is .
There are 23 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Russia, 40 UNESCO biosphere reserves, 41 national parks and 101 nature reserves.
It lies between latitudes 41° and 82° N, and longitudes 19° E and 169° W.Russia has a wide natural resource base, including major deposits of timber, petroleum, natural gas, coal, ores and other mineral resources.
What city is the largest financial center in Europe?
England's economy is one of the largest in the world, with an average GDP per capita of £22,907.
Usually regarded as a mixed market economy, it has adopted many free market principles, yet maintains an advanced social welfare infrastructure.
The official currency in England is the pound sterling, whose ISO 4217 code is GBP.
Taxation in England is quite competitive when compared to much of the rest of Europe—as of 2009 the basic rate of personal tax is 20% on taxable income up to £37,400, and 40% on any additional earnings above that amount.The economy of England is the largest part of the UK's economy, which has the 18th highest GDP PPP per capita in the world.
England is a leader in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors and in key technical industries, particularly aerospace, the arms industry, and the manufacturing side of the software industry.
London, home to the London Stock Exchange, the United Kingdom's main stock exchange and the largest in Europe, is England's financial centre—100 of Europe's 500 largest corporations are based in London.
London is the largest financial centre in Europe, and is also the largest in the world.The Bank of England, founded in 1694 by Scottish banker William Paterson, is the United Kingdom's central bank.
Originally established as private banker to the Government of England, since 1946 it has been a state-owned institution.
The Bank has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in England and Wales, although not in other parts of the United Kingdom.
The government has devolved responsibility to the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee for managing the monetary policy of the country and setting interest rates.England is highly industrialised, but since the 1970s there has been a decline in traditional heavy and manufacturing industries, and an increasing emphasis on a more service industry oriented economy.
Tourism has become a significant industry, attracting millions of visitors to England each year.
The export part of the economy is dominated by pharmaceuticals, cars—although many English marques are now foreign-owned, such as Rolls-Royce, Lotus, Jaguar and Bentley—crude oil and petroleum from the English parts of North Sea oil along with Wytch Farm, aircraft engines and alcoholic beverages.
Agriculture is intensive and highly mechanised, producing 60% of food needs with only 2% of the labour force.
Two thirds of production is devoted to livestock, the other to arable crops.
What percentage of french films account for the total film revenues of France
France has historical and strong links with cinema, with two Frenchmen, Auguste and Louis Lumière (known as the Lumière Brothers) having created cinema in 1895.
France remains a leader in filmmaking, as of 2006 producing more films than any other European country.
The nation also hosts the Cannes Festival, one of the most important and famous film festivals in the world.Although the French film market is dominated by Hollywood, France is the only nation in the world where American films make up the smallest share of total film revenues, at 50%, compared with 77% in Germany and 69% in Japan.
French films account for 35% of the total film revenues of France, which is the highest percentage of national film revenues in the developed world outside the United States, compared to 14% in Spain and 8% in the UK.Until recently, France had for centuries been the cultural center of the world, although its dominant position has been surpassed by the United States.
Subsequently, France takes steps in protecting and promoting its culture, becoming a leading advocate of the cultural exception.
The nation succeeded in convincing all EU members to refuse to include culture and audiovisuals in the list of liberalized sectors of the WTO in 1993.Moreover, this decision was confirmed in a voting in the UNESCO in 2005, and the principle of "cultural exception" won an overwhelming victory: 198 countries voted for it, only 2 countries, the U.S and Israel, voted against it.
What had little effort during South Korea's first 20 year of growth?
During the first 20 years of South Korea's growth surge, little effort was made to preserve the environment.
Unchecked industrialization and urban development have resulted in deforestation and the ongoing destruction of wetlands such as the Songdo Tidal Flat.
However, there have been recent efforts to balance these problems, including a government run five-year green growth project that aims to boost energy efficiency and green technology.The green-based economic strategy is a comprehensive overhaul of South Korea's economy, utilizing nearly two percent of the national GDP.
The greening initiative includes such efforts as a nationwide bike network, solar and wind energy, lowering oil dependent vehicles, backing daylight savings and extensive usage of environmentally friendly technologies such as LEDs in electronics and lighting.
The country – already the world's most wired – plans to build a nationwide next-generation network which will be 10 times faster than broadband facilities in order to reduce energy usage.The renewable portfolio standard program with renewable energy certificates runs from 2012 to 2022.
Quota systems favor large, vertically integrated generators and multinational electric utilities, if only because certificates are generally denominated in units of one megawatt-hour.
They are also more difficult to design and implement than an a Feed-in tariff.Lauber, V. (2004).

How many airports are in Japan?
, 46.1 percent of energy in Japan was produced from petroleum, 21.3 percent from coal, 21.4 percent from natural gas, 4.0 percent from nuclear power, and 3.3 percent from hydropower.
Nuclear power produced 9.2 percent of Japan's electricity, as of 2011, down from 24.9 percent the previous year.
However, as of May 5, 2012, all of the country's nuclear power plants had been taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, though government officials have been continuing to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some of Japan's 50 nuclear reactors to service.
Given its heavy dependence on imported energy, Japan has aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency.Japan's road spending has been extensive.
Its 1.2 million kilometers of paved road are the main means of transportation.
A single network of high-speed, divided, limited-access toll roads connects major cities and is operated by toll-collecting enterprises.
New and used cars are inexpensive; car ownership fees and fuel levies are used to promote energy efficiency.
However, at just 50 percent of all distance traveled, car usage is the lowest of all G8 countries.Dozens of Japanese railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation markets; major companies include seven JR enterprises, Kintetsu Corporation, Seibu Railway and Keio Corporation.
Some 250 high-speed Shinkansen trains connect major cities and Japanese trains are known for their safety and punctuality.
Proposals for a new Maglev route between Tokyo and Osaka are at an advanced stage.
There are 173 airports in Japan; the largest domestic airport, Haneda Airport, is Asia's second-busiest airport.
The largest international gateways are Narita International Airport, Kansai International Airport and Chūbu Centrair International Airport.
Nagoya Port is the country's largest and busiest port, accounting for 10 percent of Japan's trade value.
How many national holidays does India have which are observed in all states and union territories?
Traditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy.
The Indian caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found in the Indian subcontinent.
Social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as "jātis", or "castes".
India declared the caste system and untouchability to be illegal in 1947 and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives.
At the workplace in urban India and in international or leading Indian companies, the caste related identification has pretty much lost its importance.
Family values are important in the Indian tradition, and multi-generational patriarchal joint families have been the norm in India, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas.
An overwhelming majority of Indians, with their consent, have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family members.
Marriage is thought to be for life, and the divorce rate is extremely low.
Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women in India wed before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age.
Female infanticide in India and female foeticide in India have caused a discrepancy in the sex ratio, as of 2005 it was estimated that there were 50 million more males than females in the nation.
However the recent report from 2011 shown improvement among the gender ratio.
The payment of Dowry, although illegal, remains widespread across class lines.
Deaths resulting from dowry, mostly from bride burning, is on the rise.Many Indian festivals are religious in origin; among them are Chhath, Christmas, Diwali, Durga Puja, Bakr-Id, Eid ul-Fitr, Ganesh Chaturthi, Holi, Makar Sankranti or Uttarayan, Navratri, Thai Pongal, and Vaisakhi.
India has three national holidays which are observed in all states and union territories: Republic Day, Independence Day, and Gandhi Jayanti.
Other sets of holidays, varying between nine and twelve, are officially observed in individual states.Throughout India, many people practice customs and religious rituals, such as "samskara," which is a series of "personal sacraments and rites conducted at various stages throughout life."
How many personnel does the Army have?
In contrast to Sukarno's anti-imperialistic antipathy to western powers and tensions with Malaysia, Indonesia's foreign relations since the Suharto "New Order" have been based on economic and political cooperation with Western nations.
Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbors in Asia, and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit.
The nation restored relations with the People's Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era.
Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950, and was a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC, now the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation).
Indonesia is signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement, the Cairns Group, and the WTO, and has historically been a member of OPEC, although it withdrew in 2008 as it was no longer a net exporter of oil.
Indonesia has received humanitarian and development aid since 1966, in particular from the United States, western Europe, Australia, and Japan.The Indonesian Government has worked with other countries to apprehend and prosecute perpetrators of major bombings linked to militant Islamism and Al-Qaeda.
The deadliest bombing killed 202 people (including 164 international tourists) in the Bali resort town of Kuta in 2002.
The attacks, and subsequent travel warnings issued by other countries, severely damaged Indonesia's tourism industry and foreign investment prospects.Indonesia's armed forces (TNI) include the Army (TNI–AD), Navy (TNI–AL, which includes marines), and Air Force (TNI–AU).
The army has about 400,000 active-duty personnel.
Defense spending in the national budget was 4% of GDP in 2006, and is controversially supplemented by revenue from military commercial interests and foundations.
One of the reforms following the 1998 resignation of Suharto was the removal of formal TNI representation in parliament; nevertheless, its political influence remains extensive.Separatist movements in the provinces of Aceh and Papua have led to armed conflict, and subsequent allegations of human rights abuses and brutality from all sides.
Following a sporadic thirty-year guerrilla war between the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) and the Indonesian military, a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2005.
In Papua, there has been a significant, albeit imperfect, implementation of regional autonomy laws, and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses, since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.
Why did Brazil's population increase between 1940 and 1970?
The population of Brazil, as recorded by the 2008 PNAD, was approximately 190 million (), with a ratio of men to women of 0.95:1 and 83.75% of the population defined as urban.
The population is heavily concentrated in the Southeastern (79.8 million inhabitants) and Northeastern (53.5 million inhabitants) regions, while the two most extensive regions, the Center-West and the North, which together make up 64.12% of the Brazilian territory, have a total of only 29.1 million inhabitants.The first census in Brazil was carried out in 1872 and recorded a population of 9,930,478.
From 1880 to 1930, 4 million Europeans arrived.
Brazil's population increased significantly between 1940 and 1970, because of a decline in the mortality rate, even though the birth rate underwent a slight decline.
In the 1940s the annual population growth rate was 2.4%, rising to 3.0% in the 1950s and remaining at 2.9% in the 1960s, as life expectancy rose from 44 to 54 years and to 72.6 years in 2007.It has been steadily falling since the 1960s, from 3.04% per year between 1950 and 1960 to 1.05% in 2008 and is expected to fall to a negative value of –0.29% by 2050 thus completing the demographic transition.In 2008, the illiteracy rate was 11.48% and among the youth (ages 15–19) 1.74%.
It was highest (20.30%) in the Northeast, which had a large proportion of rural poor.
Illiteracy was high (24.18%) among the rural population and lower (9.05%) among the urban population.
In what year did Britain end it's ruling over India?
The gradual decline of the Mughal Empire in the early eighteenth century enabled Sikh rulers to control large areas until the British East India Company gained ascendancy over South Asia.
The Indian Rebellion of 1857, also known as the Sepoy Mutiny, was the region's major armed struggle against the British.The largely non-violent independence struggle led by the Indian National Congress engaged millions of protesters in mass campaigns of civil disobedience in the 1920s and 1930s.The All-India Muslim League rose to popularity in the late 1930s amid fears of under-representation and neglect of Muslims in politics.
In his presidential address of 29 December 1930, Muhammad Iqbal called for "the formation of a consolidated North-West Indian Muslim State" consisting of Punjab, North-West Frontier Province, Sind and Baluchistan.
Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, espoused the two-nation theory and led the Muslim League to adopt the Lahore Resolution of 1940, popularly known as the Pakistan Resolution.
In early 1947, Britain announced the decision to end its rule in India.
In June 1947, the nationalist leaders of British India—including Jawaharlal Nehru and Abul Kalam Azad representing the Congress, Jinnah representing the Muslim League, and Master Tara Singh representing the Sikhs—agreed to the proposed terms of transfer of power and independence.The modern state of Pakistan was established on 14 August 1947 (27 Ramadan 1366 in the Islamic Calendar) in the eastern and northwestern regions of British India, where there was a Muslim majority.
It comprised the provinces of Balochistan, East Bengal, the North-West Frontier Province, West Punjab and Sindh.
The partition of the Punjab and Bengal provinces led to communal riots across India and Pakistan; millions of Muslims moved to Pakistan and millions of Hindus and Sikhs moved to India.
Dispute over Jammu and Kashmir led to the First Kashmir War.
How long was Nigeria under military rule?
Democratization (1999-).Nigeria regained democracy in 1999 when it elected Olusegun Obasanjo, the former military head of state, as the new President of Nigeria ending almost 33 years of military rule (from 1966 until 1999) excluding the short-lived second republic (between 1979 and 1983) by military dictators who seized power in coups d'état and counter-coups during the Nigerian military juntas of 1966–1979 and 1983–1998.Although the elections which brought Obasanjo to power in 1999 and again in 2003 were condemned as unfree and unfair, Nigeria has shown marked improvements in attempts to tackle government corruption and to hasten development.Ethnic violence over the oil producing Niger Delta region and inadequate infrastructures are some of the issues in the country.
Umaru Yar'Adua of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) came into power in the general election of 2007 – an election that was witnessed and condemned by the international community as being severely flawed.Yar'Adua died on 5 May 2010.
Dr. Goodluck Jonathan was sworn in as Yar'Adua's replacement on 6 May 2010, becoming Nigeria's 14th Head of State, while his vice, a former Kaduna State governor, Namadi Sambo, an architect, was chosen on 18 May 2010, by the National Assembly following President Goodluck Jonathan's nomination for Sambo to be his Vice-President.Goodluck Jonathan served as Nigeria's president till 16 April 2011, when a new presidential election in Nigeria was conducted.
Goodluck Jonathan of the PDP was declared the winner on 19 April 2011, having won the election by a total of 22,495,187 of the 39,469,484 votes cast to stand ahead of Muhammadu Buhari from the main opposition party, the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), which won 12,214,853 of the total votes cast.The international media reported the elections as having run smoothly with relatively little violence or voter fraud in contrast to previous elections.
Who promoted the development of philosophy and the arts in Mexico?
[[File:Frida Kahlo Diego Rivera 1932.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Frida Kahlo with Diego Rivera in 1932, photography byCarl van Vechten.
]]Mexican culture reflects the complexity of the country's history through the blending of indigenous cultures and the culture of Spain, imparted during Spain's 300-year colonization of Mexico.
Exogenous cultural elements have been incorporated into Mexican culture as time have passed.The Porfirian era ("el Porfiriato"), in the last quarter of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century, was marked by economic progress and peace.
After four decades of civil unrest and war, Mexico saw the development of philosophy and the arts, promoted by President Díaz himself.
Since that time, as accentuated during the Mexican Revolution, cultural identity has had its foundation in the "mestizaje", of which the indigenous (i.e.
Amerindian) element is the core.
In light of the various ethnicities that formed the Mexican people, José Vasconcelos in his publication "La Raza Cósmica" (The Cosmic Race) (1925) defined Mexico to be the melting pot of all races (thus extending the definition of the "mestizo") not only biologically but culturally as well.
How many provinces is Vietnam divided into?
Vietnam is divided into 58 provinces (Vietnamese: "tỉnh", from the Chinese 省, "shěng").
There are also five municipalities ("thành phố trực thuộc trung ương"), which are administratively on the same level as provinces.The provinces are subdivided into provincial municipalities ("thành phố trực thuộc tỉnh"), townships ("thị xã") and counties ("huyện"), which are in turn subdivided into towns ("thị trấn") or communes ("xã").
The centrally controlled municipalities are subdivided into districts ("quận") and counties, which are further subdivided into wards ("phường").
Who was the last ruler of Egypt from the Ptolemaic line?
The Ptolemaic Kingdom was a powerful Hellenistic state, extending from southern Syria in the east, to Cyrene to the west, and south to the frontier with Nubia.
Alexandria became the capital city and a center of Greek culture and trade.
To gain recognition by the native Egyptian populace, they named themselves as the successors to the Pharaohs.
The later Ptolemies took on Egyptian traditions, had themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress, and participated in Egyptian religious life.The last ruler from the Ptolemaic line was Cleopatra VII, who committed suicide following the burial of her lover Mark Antony who had died in her arms (from a self-inflicted stab wound), after Octavian had captured Alexandria and her mercenary forces had fled.The Ptolemies faced rebellions of native Egyptians often caused by an unwanted regime and were involved in foreign and civil wars that led to the decline of the kingdom and its annexation by Rome.
Nevertheless Hellenistic culture continued to thrive in Egypt well after the Muslim conquest.Christianity was brought to Egypt by Saint Mark the Evangelist in the 1st century.
Diocletian's reign marked the transition from the Roman to the Byzantine era in Egypt, when a great number of Egyptian Christians were persecuted.
The New Testament had by then been translated into Egyptian.
After the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451, a distinct Egyptian Coptic Church was firmly established.
Who has the second largest standing armed force in NATO?
Turkey has the second largest standing armed force in NATO, after the US Armed Forces, with an estimated strength of 495,000 deployable forces, according to a 2011 NATO estimate.
Turkey is one of five NATO member states which are part of the nuclear sharing policy of the alliance, together with Belgium, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands.
A total of 90 B61 nuclear bombs are hosted at the Incirlik Air Base, 40 of which are allocated for use by the Turkish Air Force in case of a nuclear conflict, but their use requires the approval of NATO.The Turkish Armed Forces consists of the Land Forces, the Naval Forces and the Air Force.
The Gendarmerie and the Coast Guard operate as parts of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in peacetime, although they are subordinated to the Army and Navy Commands respectively in wartime, during which they have both internal law enforcement and military functions.The Chief of the General Staff is appointed by the President and is responsible to the Prime Minister.
The Council of Ministers is responsible to the Parliament for matters of national security and the adequate preparation of the armed forces to defend the country.
However, the authority to declare war and to deploy the Turkish Armed Forces to foreign countries or to allow foreign armed forces to be stationed in Turkey rests solely with the Parliament.
The actual Commander of the Armed Forces is the Chief of the General Staff General Necdet Özel since 4 August 2011.Every fit male Turkish citizen otherwise not barred is required to serve in the military for a period ranging from three weeks to a year, dependent on education and job location.
Turkey does not recognise conscientious objection and does not offer a civilian alternative to military service.
How many districts is Germany divided into?
Germany comprises sixteen states which are collectively referred to as "Länder".
</ref>Each state has its own state constitution and is largely autonomous in regard to its internal organisation.
Because of differences in size and population the subdivisions of these states vary, especially as between city states ("Stadtstaaten") and states with larger territories ("Flächenländer").
For regional administrative purposes five states, namely Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony, consist of a total of 22 Government Districts ("Regierungsbezirke").
Germany is divided into 403 districts ("Kreise") at a municipal level; these consist of 301 rural districts and 102 urban districts.
How many free wi-fi internet hotspots are in Bangkok?
In Bangkok, there are 23,000 free wi-fi internet hotspots provided to the public.
The Internet in Thailand also consists of 10Gbit/s high speed fiber-optic lines that can be leased and ISP's such as KIRZ that provide residential internet services.The internet is censored by the Thai government, making some sites unreachable.
Organisations involved are the Royal Thai Police, the Communications Authority of Thailand, and the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology (MICT).
In what year was Italy admitted into the United Nations?
Italy is a founding member of the European Community, now the European Union (EU), and of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Italy was admitted to the United Nations in 1955, and it is a member and strong supporter of a wide number of international organizations, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/World Trade Organization (GATT/WTO), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the Council of Europe, and the Central European Initiative.
Its recent turns in the rotating presidency of international organisations include the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), the forerunner of the OSCE, in 1994; G8; and the EU in 2009 and from July to December 2003.Italy strongly supports multilateral international politics, endorsing the United Nations and its international security activities.
As of 2013, Italy was deploying 5,296 troops abroad, engaged in 33 UN and NATO missions in 25 countries of the world.
Italy deployed troops in support of UN peacekeeping missions in Somalia, Mozambique, and East Timor and provides support for NATO and UN operations in Bosnia, Kosovo and Albania.
Italy deployed over 2,000 troops in Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) from February 2003.
Italy still supports international efforts to reconstruct and stabilize Iraq, but it had withdrawn its military contingent of some 3,200 troops by November 2006, maintaining only humanitarian operators and other civilian personnel.In August 2006 Italy deployed about 2,450 troops in Lebanon for the United Nations' peacekeeping mission UNIFIL.
Italy is one of the largest financiers of the Palestinian National Authority, contributing € 60 million in 2013 alone.
What is the most densely populated part of Canada?
Canada occupies a major northern portion of North America, sharing land borders with the contiguous United States to the south (the longest border between two countries in the world) and the US state of Alaska to the northwest.
Canada stretches from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west; to the north lies the Arctic Ocean.
Greenland is to the northeast, while Saint Pierre and Miquelon is south of Newfoundland.
By total area (including its waters), Canada is the second-largest country in the world, after Russia.
By land area alone, Canada ranks fourth.
The country lies between latitudes 41° and 84°N, and longitudes 52° and 141°W.Since 1925, Canada has claimed the portion of the Arctic between 60° and 141°W longitude, but this claim is not universally recognized.
Canada is home to the world's northernmost settlement, Canadian Forces Station Alert, on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island – latitude 82.5°N – which lies from the North Pole.
Much of the Canadian Arctic is covered by ice and permafrost.
Canada has the longest coastline in the world, with a total length of ; additionally, its border with the United States is the world's longest land border, stretching .Since the end of the last glacial period, Canada has consisted of eight distinct forest regions, including extensive boreal forest on the Canadian Shield.
Canada has around 31,700 large lakes, more than any other country, containing much of the world's fresh water.There are also fresh-water glaciers in the Canadian Rockies and the Coast Mountains.Canada is geologically active, having many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes, notably Mount Meager, Mount Garibaldi, Mount Cayley, and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.
The volcanic eruption of the Tseax Cone in 1775 was among Canada's worst natural disasters, killing 2,000 Nisga'a people and destroying their village in the Nass River valley of northern British Columbia.
The eruption produced a lava flow, and, according to Nisga'a legend, blocked the flow of the Nass River.Canada's population density, at , is among the lowest in the world.
The most densely populated part of the country is the Quebec City – Windsor Corridor, situated in Southern Quebec and Southern Ontario along the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River.Average winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary from region to region.
Winters can be harsh in many parts of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces, which experience a continental climate, where daily average temperatures are near −15 °C (5 °F), but can drop below with severe wind chills.
In noncoastal regions, snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while in parts of the north snow can persist year-round.
Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter.
On the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s °C (70s °F), while between the coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges from , with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding .
How many Jehovah's Witnesses are there?
Roman Catholicism has long been the main religion of Spain, and although it no longer has official status by law, in all public schools in Spain students have to choose either a religion or ethics class, and Catholicism is the only religion officially taught.
According to an April 2012 study by the Spanish Center of Sociological Research about 71% of Spaniards self-identify as Catholics, 2.7% other faith, and about 24% identify with no religion (9.4% of the total are atheists).
Most Spaniards do not participate regularly in religious services.
This same study shows that of the Spaniards who identify themselves as religious, 59% hardly ever or never go to church, 15% go to church some times a year, 8% some time per month and 14% every Sunday or multiple times per week.Altogether, about 22% of the entire Spanish population attends religious services at least once per month.
Though Spanish society has become considerably more secular in recent decades, the influx of Latin American immigrants, who tend to be strong Catholic practitioners, has helped the Catholic Church to recover.Protestant churches have about 1,200,000 members.
There are about 105,000 Jehovah's Witnesses.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has approximately 46,000 adherents in 133 congregations in all regions of the country and has a temple in the Moratalaz District of Madrid.A study made by "Unión de comunidades islámicas de España" demonstrated that there were about 1,700,000 inhabitants of Muslim background living in Spain as of 2012, accounting for 3-4% of the total population of Spain.
The vast majority was composed of immigrants and descendants originating from Morocco and other African countries.
More than 514,000 (30%) of them had Spanish nationality.The recent waves of immigration have also led to an increasing number of Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs and Muslims.After the Reconquista in 1492, Muslims did not live in Spain for centuries.
Late 19th-century colonial expansion in northwestern Africa gave a number of residents in Spanish Morocco and Western Sahara full citizenship.
Their ranks have since been bolstered by recent immigration, especially from Morocco and Algeria.Judaism was practically non-existent in Spain from the 1492 expulsion until the 19th century, when Jews were again permitted to enter the country.
Currently there are around 62,000 Jews in Spain, or 0.14% of the total population.
Most are arrivals in the past century, while some are descendants of earlier Spanish Jews.
Approximately 80,000 Jews are thought to have lived in Spain on the eve of the Spanish Inquisition.
What was The Shire based from?
The influence of the Welsh language, which Tolkien had learnt, is summarised in his essay English and Welsh: "If I may once more refer to my work.
The Lord of the Rings, in evidence: the names of persons and places in this story were mainly composed on patterns deliberately modelled on those of Welsh (closely similar but not identical).
This element in the tale has given perhaps more pleasure to more readers than anything else in it.
""The Lord of the Rings" developed as a personal exploration by Tolkien of his interests in philology, religion (particularly Roman Catholicism), fairy tales, Norse and general Germanic mythology, and also Celtic, Slavic, Persian, Greek, and Finnish mythology.
Tolkien acknowledged, and external critics have verified, the influences of George MacDonald and William Morris and the Anglo-Saxon poem "Beowulf".
The question of a direct influence of Wagner's "The Nibelung's Ring" on Tolkien's work is debated by critics.Tolkien included neither any explicit religion nor cult in his work.
Rather the themes, moral philosophy, and cosmology of the Lord of the Rings reflect his Catholic worldview.
In one of his letters Tolkien states, "The Lord of the Rings is of course a fundamentally religious and Catholic work; unconsciously so at first, but consciously in the revision.
That is why I have not put in, or have cut out, practically all references to anything like 'religion', to cults or practices, in the imaginary world.
For the religious element is absorbed into the story and the symbolism.
"Some locations and characters were inspired by Tolkien's childhood in Birmingham, where he first lived near Sarehole Mill, and later near Edgbaston Reservoir.
There are also hints of the Black Country, which is within easy reach of north west Edgbaston.
This shows in such names as "Underhill", and the description of Saruman's industrialisation of Isengard and The Shire.
It has also been suggested that The Shire and its surroundings were based on the countryside around Stonyhurst College in Lancashire where Tolkien frequently stayed during the 1940s.
The work was influenced by the effects of his military service during World War I, to the point that Frodo has been "diagnosed" as suffering from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, or "shell-shock," which was first diagnosed at the Battle of the Somme, at which Tolkien served.
What company originally released The Terminator soundtrack album?
Release.The soundtrack album was originally released through Enigma Records.
It was followed by a CD and cassette reissue on July 1, 1991 through DCC Compact Classics.
A remastered edition entitled "The Definitive Edition" was released on August 22, 1995 through Edel AG.
This edition contained a 73-minute running time and included a bonus track the "Judgement Day Remix" of "Theme from The Terminator."
The liner notes of the album contained extensive annotations for each track.
What was the worldwide gross for "Terminator Salvation"?
The film's first nationwide U.S. screenings were at 12 A.M. on Thursday, May 21, 2009, making $3 million from midnight screenings and earning $13.3 million in its first day and grossed an additional $42,558,390 on its 4-day Memorial Day opening weekend from 3,530 theaters.
It debuted at #2 behind "", giving it a lower first weekend take than its predecessor, becoming the first film in the series not to open at #1 and failing to meet Boxoffice Magazine predictions by 50%.
"Terminator Salvation" was more successful in its international release, opening at #1 in 66 of 70 territories through the first week of June, and continuing to be the highest-grossing film in the following week.
The film's total domestic gross was $125,322,469, along with $246,030,532 from overseas territories, for a worldwide gross of $371,353,001.
As of December 2009, the film ranks 14th for the year internationally and 23rd domestically (U.S. and Canada), which ranks it last in the series and puts it below initial expectations in terms of domestic gross and first weekend, as well as overall global take.
What company made Sherk?
"Shrek" is the third DreamWorks animated film (and the only film in the Shrek series) to have Harry Gregson-Williams team up with John Powell to composes the score (after "Antz" (1998) and "Chicken Run" (2000)).
"Shrek" introduced a new element to give the film a unique feel.
The film used pop music and other Oldies to make the story more forward.
Covers of songs like "On the Road Again" and "Try a Little Tenderness" were integrated in the film's score.
As the film was about to be completed, Katzenberg suggested to the filmmakers to redo the film's ending in order to "go out with a big laugh"; Instead of ending film with just a storybook closing over Shrek and Fiona as they ride off into the sunset, they decided to add a song "I'm a Believer" covered by Smash Mouth and show all the fairytale creatures in the film.Although Rufus Wainwright's version of the song "Hallelujah" appeared in the soundtrack album, it was John Cale's version that appeared in the film; in a radio interview, Rufus Wainwright suggested that his version of "Hallelujah" did not appear in the film due to the "glass ceiling" he was hitting because of his sexuality.
An alternate explanation posits that because Wainwright was an artist for DreamWorks and John Cale was not, thus licensing issues prohibited Cale's version from appearing in the soundtrack album, despite having the filmmakers wanting to have Cale's version appear in the film.
Who composed the music for Toy Story?
Disney was concerned with Lasseter's position on the use of music.
Unlike other Disney films of the time, Lasseter did not want the film to be a musical, saying it was a buddy film featuring "real toys."
Joss Whedon agreed saying, "It would have been a really bad musical, because it's a buddy movie.
It's about people who won't admit what they want, much less sing about it.
...
Buddy movies are about sublimating, punching an arm, 'I hate you.'
It's not about open emotion."
However, Disney favored the musical format, claiming "Musicals are our orientation.
Characters breaking into song is a great shorthand.
It takes some of the onus off what they're asking for."
Disney and Pixar reached a compromise: the characters in "Toy Story" would not break into song, but the film would use songs over the action, as in "The Graduate", to convey and amplify the emotions that Buzz and Woody were feeling.
Disney tapped Randy Newman to compose the film.
The edited "Toy Story" was due to Randy Newman and Gary Rydstrom in late September 1995 for their final work on the score and sound design, respectively.Lasseter claimed "His songs are touching, witty, and satirical, and he would deliver the emotional underpinning for every scene."
Newman developed the film's signature song "You've Got a Friend in Me" in one day.
Who voices the character of Po?
Two popular online games, "The Adversary" and "The Field of Fiery Danger", were created by Playniac to accompany the movie release.
"The Adversary" is based on the moment where the main character Po, voiced by Jack Black, attacks a punchbag and underestimates its response.
"The Field of Fiery Danger" is based on scenes where Po accidentally falls into the pit of fire spouting tubes and also the moment where the kung fu master Shifu realizes that the only way to get through to Po is with food.
Both games have 20 challenging levels and were featured as game of the week on the Nickelodeon web site.
What is the name of the movie that describes the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who spends 19 years in Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence?
The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.Adapted from the Stephen King novella "Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption", the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who spends 19 years in Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence.
During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation.Despite a lukewarm box office reception that barely recouped its budget, the film received multiple award nominations and favorable reviews from critics for its acting and realism.
It has since enjoyed a remarkable life on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray.
It was included in the American Film Institute's 100 Years...100 Movies 10th Anniversary Edition.
What was Salvator Gravano's nickname?
Since its release, "The Godfather" has received critical acclaim.
Rotten Tomatoes reports that all 77 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 9.1/10.
Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a perfect weighted average score of 100 (out of 100) based on 14 reviews from mainstream critics, considered to be "universal acclaim".Both "The Godfather" and "The Godfather Part II" were selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990 and 1993, respectively.
International critics routinely list these two among cinema's pinnacle achievements, sometimes considering them as one work.
In the decennial 2002 "Sight & Sound" poll of film directors, the pair was ranked as the second best film of all time.
The critics poll separately voted it fourth.
The American Film Institute has listed it second in U.S. film history behind "Citizen Kane".
Other polls and publications have it first, as well, among them "Entertainment Weekly", and "Empire" magazine (November 2008)The soundtrack's main theme by Nino Rota was also critically acclaimed; the main theme ("Speak Softly Love") is well-known and widely used (see Score Controversy for more information).Director Stanley Kubrick believed that "The Godfather" was possibly the greatest movie ever made, and had without question the best cast.Previous Mafia movies had looked at the gangs from the perspective of an outraged outsider.
In contrast, "The Godfather" presents the gangster's perspective of the Mafia as a response to corrupt society.
Although the Corleone family is presented as immensely rich and powerful, no scenes depict prostitution, gambling, loan sharking or other forms of racketeering.
Some critics argue that the setting of a criminal counterculture allows for unapologetic gender stereotyping, and is an important part of the film's appeal ("You can act like a man!
", Don Vito tells a weepy Johnny Fontane).Real-life gangsters responded enthusiastically to the film, with many of them feeling it was a portrayal of how they were supposed to act.
Salvatore "Sammy the Bull" Gravano, the former underboss in the Gambino crime family, stated: "I left the movie stunned ...
I mean I floated out of the theater.
Maybe it was fiction, but for me, then, that was our life.
It was incredible.
I remember talking to a multitude of guys, made guys, who felt exactly the same way. "
According to Anthony Fiato after seeing the film, Patriarca crime family members Paulie Intiso and Nicky Giso altered their speech patterns closer to that of Vito Corleone's.
Intiso would frequently swear and use poor grammar; but after the movie came out, he started to articulate and philosophize more.Remarking on the 40th anniversary of the film's release, film critic John Podhoretz praised "The Godfather" as "arguably "the" great American work of popular art" and "the summa of all great moviemaking before it".
Two years before, Roger Ebert wrote in his journal that it "comes closest to being a film everyone agrees... is unquestionably great."
Which actor thought his character was too one-dimensional?
Screenwriter Jim Uhls started working on an early draft of the adapted screenplay, which excluded a voice-over because the industry perceived at the time that the technique was "hackneyed and trite".
When Fincher joined the film, he thought that the film should have a voice-over, believing that the film's humor came from the narrator's voice.
The director described the film without a voice-over as seemingly "sad and pathetic".
Fincher and Uhls revised the script for six to seven months and by 1997 had a third draft that reordered the story and left out several major elements.
When Pitt was cast, he was concerned that his character, Tyler Durden, was too one-dimensional.
Fincher sought the advice of writer-director Cameron Crowe, who suggested giving the character more ambiguity.
Fincher also hired screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker for assistance.
The director invited Pitt and Norton to help revise the script, and the group drafted five revisions in the course of a year.Chuck Palahniuk praised the faithful film adaptation of his novel and applauded how the film's plot was more streamlined than the book's.
Palahniuk recalled how the writers debated if film audiences would believe the plot twist from the novel.
Fincher supported including the twist, arguing, "If they accept everything up to this point, they'll accept the plot twist.
If they're still in the theater, they'll stay with it."
Palahniuk's novel also contained homoerotic overtones, which the director included in the film to make audiences uncomfortable and accentuate the surprise of the film's twists.
The bathroom scene where Tyler Durden bathes next to the narrator is an example of the overtones; the line, "I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need," was meant to suggest personal responsibility rather than homosexuality.
Another example is the scene at the beginning of the film in which Tyler Durden puts a gun barrel down the narrator's mouth.The narrator finds redemption at the end of the film by rejecting Tyler Durden's dialectic, a path that diverged from the novel's ending in which the narrator is placed in a mental institution.
Norton drew parallels between redemption in the film and redemption in "The Graduate", indicating that the protagonists of both films find a middle ground between two divisions of self.
Fincher considered the novel too infatuated with Tyler Durden and changed the ending to move away from him: "I wanted people to love Tyler, but I also wanted them to be OK with his vanquishing."
Winston Groom was to receive what percentage of the film's net profit?
Winston Groom was paid $350,000 for the screenplay rights to his novel "Forrest Gump" and was contracted for a 3 percent share of the film's net profits.
However, Paramount and the film's producers did not pay him, using Hollywood accounting to posit that the blockbuster film lost money.
Tom Hanks, by contrast, contracted for the film's gross receipts instead of a salary, and he and director Zemeckis each received $40 million.
Additionally, Groom was not mentioned once in any of the film's six Oscar-winner speeches.The dispute was later resolved.
How many Academy Awards did the Matrix win?
The Matrix is a 1999 American–Australian science fiction action film written and directed by The Wachowski Brothers, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano.
It depicts a dystopian future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called "the Matrix", created by sentient machines to subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source.
Computer programmer "Neo" learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, which involves other people who have been freed from the "dream world".
"The Matrix" is known for popularizing a visual effect known as "bullet time", in which the heightened perception of certain characters is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow-motion while the camera's viewpoint appears to move through the scene at normal speed.
The film is an example of the cyberpunk science fiction genre.
It contains numerous references to philosophical and religious ideas, and prominently pays homage to works such as Plato's Allegory of the Cave, Jean Baudrillard's "Simulacra and Simulation" and Lewis Carroll's "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland".
The Wachowskis' approach to action scenes drew upon their admiration for Japanese animation and martial arts films, and the film's use of fight choreographers and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema was influential upon subsequent Hollywood action film productions.
"The Matrix" was first released in the United States on , 1999, and grossed over $460 million worldwide.
It was generally well-received by critics, and won four Academy Awards as well as other accolades including BAFTA Awards and Saturn Awards.
Reviewers praised "The Matrix" for its innovative visual effects, cinematography and its entertainment.
The film's premise was both criticized for being derivative of earlier science fiction works, and praised for being intriguing.
The action also polarized critics, some describing it as impressive, but others dismissing it as a trite distraction from an interesting premise.Despite this, the film has since appeared in lists of the greatest science fiction films,--> and in 2012, was added to the National Film Registry for preservation.
The success of the film led to the release of two feature film sequels, both written and directed by the Wachowski Brothers, "The Matrix Reloaded" and "The Matrix Revolutions".
The "Matrix" franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games, and animated short films in which the Wachowskis were heavily involved.
The title "The Usual Suspects" is derived from a line featured in which movie?
The Usual Suspects is a 1995 American crime-thriller film directed by Bryan Singer and written by Christopher McQuarrie.
It stars Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio del Toro, Chazz Palminteri, Kevin Pollak, Pete Postlethwaite, and Kevin Spacey.The film follows the interrogation of Roger "Verbal" Kint, a small-time con man who is one of only two survivors of a massacre and fire on a ship docked at the Port of Los Angeles.
He tells an interrogator a convoluted story about events that led him and four other criminals to the boat, and of a mysterious mob boss known as Keyser Söze who commissioned their work.
Using flashback and narration, Kint's story becomes increasingly complex.The film, shot on a $6 million budget, began as a title taken from a column in "Spy" magazine called "The Usual Suspects", after one of Claude Rains' most memorable lines in the classic film "Casablanca."
Singer thought it would make a good title for a film, the poster for which he and McQuarrie had developed as the first visual idea.
"The Usual Suspects" was shown out of competition at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival, and then initially released in a few theaters.
It received favorable reviews, and was eventually given a wider release.
McQuarrie won an Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) and Spacey won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance.

In 1994 what was the highest-grossing film in North America?
"The Lion King" had a limited release in North America on June 15, 1994, playing in only two theaters, El Capitan Theater in Los Angeles and Radio City Music Hall in New York City.
It still earned $1,586,753 across the weekend of June 17–19, standing at the tenth place of the box office ranking.
The average of $793,377 per theater stands as the largest ever achieved during a weekend.
The wide release followed on June 24, 1994, in 2,550 screens.
The digital surround sound of the film led many of those theater to implement Dolby Laboratories' newest sound systems.
"The Lion King" grossed $40.9 million – which at the time was the fourth biggest opening weekend earning ever and the highest sum for a Disney film – to top the weekend box office.
It also earned a rare "A+" rating from CinemaScore.
By the end of its theatrical run, in spring 1995, it had earned $312,855,561, being the second-highest-grossing 1994 film in North America behind "Forrest Gump".
Outside North America, it earned $455.8 million during its initial run, for a worldwide total of $768.6 million.
Who created a 3d model of Tom Hardy's face?
Design.Costume design.Costume designer Lindy Hemming explained that Bane uses a mask to inhale an analgesic gas, which, in director Christopher Nolan's words, "keeps his pain just below the threshold so he can function."
In designing Bane's costume, Hemming needed it to look "like an amalgam of all sorts of bits and pieces he cobbled together, as he passed through some very remote places.
We made parts of his vest, for example, from fragments of an old military tent.
His clothes are militaristic, but are not in any way a uniform."
Hemming also designed Bane's mask to look "animalistic".
Costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard created a three-dimensional model of actor Tom Hardy's face and skull to design the mask, allowing the mask to perfectly conform to the contours of Hardy's face.
Hemming personally designed Bane's coat, which she admitted took two years to complete.
Taking inspiration from a Swedish army jacket and a frock coat from the French Revolution, it was designed to make Bane look like equal parts dictatorial and revolutionary.
The design was difficult as Hemming struggled to find a tailor in Los Angeles who could work with shearling.The Batsuit consisted of 110 separate pieces, each of which had to be replicated dozens of times over the course of the production.
The base layer was made of a polyester mesh that is utilized by the military and high-tech sports manufacturers because of its breathability and moisture-wicking properties.
Molded pieces of flexible urethane were then attached to the mesh, to form the overall body armor plating.
Carbon fiber panels were placed inside the sections on the legs, chest and abdomen.
The cowl was sculpted from a cast of Bale's face and head to become a perfect fit for Christian Bale.
The suit remained unchanged for the film since "The Dark Knight".In creating Selina Kyle's catsuit, two layers of material were used, with the outer layer being polyurethane coated spandex, embossed with a hexagonal pattern.
The catsuit also consisted of elbow-length gloves, a utility belt, and thigh-high boots with spike heels.

What band is Dan Messe a founder and member of?
On 23 August 2013 composer Dan Messe, one of the founders and members of the band Hem, confirmed speculation that he would be writing the score for a musical adaptation of Amelie to premiere on Broadway.
He will be collaborating with Craig Lucas and Nathan Tysen.
Messe also confirmed he would be composing all original music for the show and not using the Yann Tiersen score.Jeunet distanced himself from the musical, saying he only sold the rights to raise funds for children's charity "Mecenat Chirurgie Cardiaque" (Cardiac Surgery Patronage).
What year was Toy Story 3 nominated for a Kids' Choice Award?
On January 25, 2011, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced that "Toy Story 3" was not only nominated for Best Animated Feature, but also for Best Picture.
This makes "Toy Story 3" not only the first animated sequel in history to be nominated for Best Picture, but also the third animated film to be nominated for Best Picture (following "Beauty and the Beast" and "Up"), with "Toy Story 3" becoming the second Pixar film to be nominated for both awards.
"Toy Story 3" also became the first ever Pixar film - and the first animated feature film since "Shrek" - to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, though six of Pixar's previous films were nominated for the Best Original Screenplay: "Toy Story", "Finding Nemo", "The Incredibles", "Ratatouille", "WALL-E", and "Up".
In 2011, it was nominated for a Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Animated Movie, but lost to "Despicable Me".
When did the film cross the $200 million mark?
Released on July 9, 2010, in the United States, "Despicable Me" opened at the number one spot at the box office and pulled in $56.3 million, making it the third biggest opening grossing for an animated film in 2010 behind "Toy Story 3" and "Shrek Forever After".
In its second weekend, the film dipped 42% to second place behind "Inception" with $32.8 million earned.
The film then had another drop of 27% in its third weekend and finished in third place with $23.8 million.
On August 5, 2010, the film crossed the $200 million mark, becoming the first Universal film to reach the milestone since 2007's "The Bourne Ultimatum".On the weekend lasting from September 3–5, 2010, it surpassed "Shrek Forever After" to become the second highest-grossing animated film of 2010 in the United States and Canada, behind "Toy Story 3".
It was also the highest-grossing non-DreamWorks/non-Disney·Pixar animated film of all time in these territories, since overtaken by its sequel.
The film has made $251,513,985 in the United States and Canada as well as an estimated $291,600,000 internationally for a worldwide total of $543,010,705, against its $69 million budget.
This film is also Universal's sixth highest-grossing film (unadjusted for inflation) and the tenth-highest-grossing animated feature of all-time in North America.
In worldwide earnings, it is the sixth biggest film of Universal Studios, the fourth highest-grossing animated film of 2010 trailing "Toy Story 3", "Shrek Forever After", and "Tangled", the 25th highest-grossing animated film of all time and the 9th highest-grossing film of 2010.
In "Batman Begins", what problem was caused by making the foam for the cape black?
The filmmakers intended to create a very mobile Batsuit that would allow the wearer to move easily to fight and crouch.
Previous film incarnations of the Batsuit had been stiff and especially restricted full head movement.
Costume designer Lindy Hemming and her crew worked on the Batsuit at an FX workshop codenamed "Cape Town", a secured compound located at Shepperton Studios in London.
The Batsuit's basic design was a neoprene undersuit, which was shaped by attaching molded cream latex sections.
Christian Bale was molded and sculpted prior to his physical training so the team could work on a full body cast.
To avoid imperfections picked up by sculpting with clay, plastiline was used to smooth the surface.
In addition, the team brewed different mixtures of foam to find the mixture that would be the most flexible, light, durable, and black.
The latter presented a problem, since the process to make the foam black reduced the foam's durability.For the cape, director Christopher Nolan wanted to have a "flowing cloak... that blows and flows as in so many great graphic novels".
Hemming's team created the cape out of their own version of parachute nylon that had electrostatic flocking, a process shared with the team by the British Ministry of Defence.
The process was used by the London police force to minimize night vision detection.
The cape was topped by a cowl, which was designed by Nolan, Hemming, and costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard.
The cowl was created to be thin enough to allow motion but thick enough to avoid wrinkling when Bale turned his head in the Batsuit.
Churchyard explained the cowl had been designed to show "a man who has angst", so his character would be revealed through the mask.
On which date did the Germans use chlorine gas for the first time on the Western Front?
Western Front.Trench warfare begins.Military tactics before World War I had failed to keep pace with advances in technology.
These advances allowed for impressive defence systems, which out-of-date military tactics could not break through for most of the war.
Barbed wire was a significant hindrance to massed infantry advances.
Artillery, vastly more lethal than in the 1870s, coupled with machine guns, made crossing open ground extremely difficult.
Commanders on both sides failed to develop tactics for breaching entrenched positions without heavy casualties.
In time, however, technology began to produce new offensive weapons, such as gas warfare and the tank.Just after the First Battle of the Marne (5–12 September 1914), both Entente and German forces each continually sought to outflank the other by manoeuvering to the north: this series of manoeuvres became known as the "Race to the Sea".
When these outflanking efforts failed, Britain and France soon found themselves facing an uninterrupted line of entrenched German forces from Lorraine to Belgium's coast.
Britain and France sought to take the offensive, while Germany defended the occupied territories.
Consequently, German trenches were much better constructed than those of their enemy; Anglo-French trenches were only intended to be "temporary" before their forces broke through German defences.Both sides tried to break the stalemate using scientific and technological advances.
On 22 April 1915, at the Second Battle of Ypres, the Germans (violating the Hague Convention) used chlorine gas for the first time on the Western Front.
Several types of gas soon became widely used by both sides, and though it never proved a decisive, battle-winning weapon, poison gas became one of the most-feared and best-remembered horrors of the war.
Tanks were first used in combat by the British during the Battle of Flers-Courcelette (part of the wider Somme offensive) on 15 September 1916, with only partial success.
However, their effectiveness would grow as the war progressed; the Germans employed only very small numbers of their own design, supplemented by captured Allied tanks.
On what day did Germany invide both Yugoslavia and Greece during World War II?
Mediterranean (1940–41).Italy began operations in the Mediterranean, initiating a siege of Malta in June, conquering British Somaliland in August, and making an incursion into British-held Egypt in September 1940.
In October 1940, Italy started the Greco-Italian War due to Mussolini's jealousy of Hitler's success but within days was repulsed and pushed back into Albania, where a stalemate soon occurred.
The United Kingdom responded to Greek requests for assistance by sending troops to Crete and providing air support to Greece.
Hitler decided to take action against Greece when the weather improved to assist the Italians and prevent the British from gaining a foothold in the Balkans, to strike against the British naval dominance of the Mediterranean, and to secure his hold on Romanian oil.In December 1940, British Commonwealth forces began counter-offensives against Italian forces in Egypt and Italian East Africa.
The offensive in North Africa was highly successful and by early February 1941 Italy had lost control of eastern Libya and large numbers of Italian troops had been taken prisoner.
The Italian Navy also suffered significant defeats, with the Royal Navy putting three Italian battleships out of commission by a carrier attack at Taranto, and neutralising several more warships at the Battle of Cape Matapan.The Germans soon intervened to assist Italy.
Hitler sent German forces to Libya in February, and by the end of March they had launched an offensive which drove back the Commonwealth forces who had been weakened to support Greece.
In under a month, Commonwealth forces were pushed back into Egypt with the exception of the besieged port of Tobruk.
The Commonwealth attempted to dislodge Axis forces in May and again in June, but failed on both occasions.By late March 1941, following Bulgaria's signing of the Tripartite Pact, the Germans were in position to intervene in Greece.
Plans were changed, however, due to developments in neighbouring Yugoslavia.
The Yugoslav government had signed the Tripartite Pact on 25 March, only to be overthrown two days later by a British-encouraged coup.
Hitler viewed the new regime as hostile and immediately decided to eliminate it.
On 6 April Germany simultaneously invaded both Yugoslavia and Greece, making rapid progress and forcing both nations to surrender within the month.
The British were driven from the Balkans after Germany conquered the Greek island of Crete by the end of May.
Although the Axis victory was swift, bitter partisan warfare subsequently broke out against the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia, which continued until the end of the war.The Allies did have some successes during this time.
In the Middle East, Commonwealth forces first quashed an uprising in Iraq which had been supported by German aircraft from bases within Vichy-controlled Syria, then, with the assistance of the Free French, invaded Syria and Lebanon to prevent further such occurrences.
What hotel did Atzerodt go to?
Booth had assigned George Atzerodt to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson, who was staying at the Kirkwood House in Washington.
Atzerodt was to go to the Vice President's room at 10:15 p.m. and shoot him.
On April 14, Atzerodt rented room 126 at the Kirkwood, directly above the room where Johnson was staying.
He arrived at the Kirkwood at the appointed time and went to the bar downstairs, carrying on his person a gun and a knife.
Atzerodt asked the bartender, Michael Henry, about the Vice President's character and behavior.
After spending some time at the hotel saloon, Atzerodt got drunk and wandered away through the streets of Washington.
Nervous, he tossed his knife away in the street.
He made his way to the Pennsylvania House Hotel by 2 a.m., where he checked into a room and went to sleep.Earlier that day, Booth stopped by the Kirkwood House and left a note for Johnson that read, "I don't wish to disturb you.
Are you at home?
J. Wilkes Booth."
The card was picked up that night by Johnson's personal secretary, William Browning.
This message has been interpreted in many different ways throughout the years.
One theory is that Booth, being afraid that Atzerodt would not succeed in killing Johnson, or worried that Atzerodt would not have the courage to carry out the assassination, tried to use the message to implicate Johnson in the conspiracy.
Another theory is that Booth was actually trying to contact Browning in order to find out whether or not Johnson was expected to be at the Kirkwood that night.
Which Supreme Court case focuses on the Louisiana Purchase?
The historian James Loewen is among those who assert that the United States purchased only France's claim to the Louisiana Territory, as the land belonged to the tribes who inhabited the area.
In his view, the US acquired the lands slowly throughout the nineteenth century by purchases from individual Native American tribes and by wars against them.
The question is discussed at length in the article on Aboriginal title in the United States, as well as in articles on the American Indian Wars and the U.S. Supreme Court case "Johnson v. M'Intosh".
What year was the centrifuge process abandoned?
The centrifuge process was regarded as the only promising separation method in April 1942.
Jesse Beams had developed such a process at the University of Virginia during the 1930s, but had encountered technical difficulties.
The process required high rotational speeds, but at certain speeds harmonic vibrations developed that threatened to tear the machinery apart.
It was therefore necessary to accelerate quickly through these speeds.
In 1941 he began working with uranium hexafluoride, the only known gaseous compound of uranium, and was able to separate uranium-235.
At Columbia, Urey had Cohen investigate the process, and he produced a body of mathematical theory making it possible to design a centrifugal separation unit, which Westinghouse undertook to construct.Scaling this up to a production plant presented a formidable technical challenge.
Urey and Cohen estimated that producing a kilogram (2.2 lb) of uranium-235 per day would require up to 50,000 centrifuges with rotors, or 10,000 centrifuges with rotors, assuming that 4-meter rotors could be built.
The prospect of keeping so many rotors operating continuously at high speed appeared daunting, and when Beams ran his experimental apparatus, he obtained only 60% of the predicted yield, indicating that more centrifuges would be required.
Beams, Urey and Cohen then began work on a series of improvements which promised to increase the efficiency of the process.
However, frequent failures of motors, shafts and bearings at high speeds delayed work on the pilot plant.
In November 1942 the centrifuge process was abandoned by the Military Policy Committee following a recommendation by Conant, Nichols and August C. Klein of Stone & Webster.
What film, starring John Wayne, was one of the first major films based on the Vietnam War?
The Vietnam War has been featured extensively in television, film, video games, and literature in the participant countries.
In American popular culture, the "Crazy Vietnam Veteran", driven mad or otherwise disturbed by his experiences in Vietnam, became a common stock character after the war.One of the first major films based on the Vietnam War was John Wayne's pro-war film, "The Green Berets" (1968).
Further cinematic representations were released during the 1970s and 1980s, including Michael Cimino's "The Deer Hunter" (1978), Francis Ford Coppola's "Apocalypse Now" (1979), Oliver Stone's "Platoon" (1986) — based on his service in the U.S. Military during the Vietnam War, Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket" (1987), "Hamburger Hill" (1987), and "Casualties of War" (1989).
Later films would include "We Were Soldiers" (2002) and "Rescue Dawn" (2007).The war also influenced a generation of musicians and songwriters in Vietnam and the United States, both anti-war and pro/anti-communist.
The band Country Joe and the Fish recorded "I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-To-Die Rag" / The "Fish" Cheer in 1965, and it became one of the most influential anti-Vietnam protest anthems.Trinh Cong Son was a South Vietnamese songwriter famous for his anti-war songs.
How many astronauts won the Congressional Gold Medal?
On July 15, 2009, Life.com released a photo gallery of previously unpublished photos of the astronauts taken by "Life" photographer Ralph Morse prior to the Apollo 11 launch.From July 16–24, 2009, NASA streamed the original mission audio on its website in real time 40 years to the minute after the events occurred.In addition, it is in the process of restoring the video footage and has released a preview of key moments.On July 20, 2009, the crew of Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins met with U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House.
"We expect that there is, as we speak, another generation of kids out there who are looking up at the sky and are going to be the next Armstrong, Collins and Aldrin," Obama said.
"We want to make sure that NASA is going to be there for them when they want to take their journey.
"The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum set up a Flash website that rebroadcasts the transmissions of Apollo 11 from launch to landing on the Moon.A group of British scientists interviewed as part of the anniversary events reflected on the significance of the Moon landing:It was carried out in a technically brilliant way with risks taken ... that would be inconceivable in the risk-averse world of today ...
The Apollo programme is arguably the greatest technical achievement of mankind to date ... nothing since Apollo has come close the excitement that was generated by those astronauts - Armstrong, Aldrin and the 10 others who followed them.On August 7, 2009, an act of Congress awarded the three astronauts a Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award in the United States.
The bill was sponsored by Florida Sen. Bill Nelson and Florida Rep. Alan Grayson.In July 2010, air to ground voice recordings and film footage shot in Mission Control during the Apollo 11 powered descent and landing was re-synchronised and released for the first time.
What treaty resolved boundary and debit issues after the Treaty of Paris?
The peace treaty with Britain, known as the Treaty of Paris, gave the U.S. all land east of the Mississippi River and south of the Great Lakes, though not including Florida (On September 3, 1783, Britain entered into a separate agreement with Spain under which Britain ceded Florida back to Spain.)
The British abandoned the Indian allies living in this region; they were not a party to this treaty and did not recognize it until they were defeated militarily by the United States.
Issues regarding boundaries and debts were not resolved until the Jay Treaty of 1795.
Since the blockade was lifted and the old imperial restrictions were gone, American merchants were free to trade with any nation anywhere in the world, and their businesses flourished.
What was the Pilgrims' stance on Christmas?
The success of the Counter-Reformation on the Continent and the growth of a Puritan party dedicated to further Protestant reform polarised the Elizabethan Age, although it was not until the '40s that England underwent religious strife comparable to what its neighbours had suffered some generations before.The early "Puritan movement" (late 16th–17th centuries) was Reformed or Calvinist and was a movement for reform in the Church of England.
Its origins lay in the discontent with the Elizabethan Religious Settlement.
The desire was for the Church of England to resemble more closely the Protestant churches of Europe, especially Geneva.
The Puritans objected to ornaments and ritual in the churches as idolatrous (vestments, surplices, organs, genuflection), which they castigated as "popish pomp and rags".
(See Vestments controversy.)
They also objected to ecclesiastical courts.
They refused to endorse completely all of the ritual directions and formulas of the "Book of Common Prayer"; the imposition of its liturgical order by legal force and inspection sharpened Puritanism into a definite opposition movement.The later Puritan movement were often referred to as dissenters and nonconformists and eventually led to the formation of various reformed denominations.The most famous and well-known emigration to America was the migration of the Puritan separatists from the Anglican Church of England, who fled first to Holland, and then later to America, to establish the English colony of Massachusetts in New England, which later became one of the original United States.These Puritan separatists were also known as "the Pilgrims".
After establishing a colony at Plymouth (which became part of the colony of Massachusetts) in 1620, the Puritan pilgrims received a charter from the King of England that legitimised their colony, allowing them to do trade and commerce with merchants in England, in accordance with the principles of mercantilism.
This successful, though initially quite difficult, colony marked the beginning of the Protestant presence in America (the earlier French, Spanish and Portuguese settlements had been Roman Catholic), and became a kind of oasis of spiritual and economic freedom, to which persecuted Protestants and other minorities from the British Isles and Europe (and later, from all over the world) fled to for peace, freedom and opportunity.
The Pilgrims of New England disapproved of Christmas and celebration was outlawed in Boston from 1659 to 1681.
The ban was revoked in 1681 by Sir Edmund Andros, who also revoked a Puritan ban against festivities on Saturday night.
Despite the removal of the ban, it wouldn't be until the middle of the 19th century that Christmas would become a popular holiday in the Boston region.The original intent of the colonists was to establish spiritual Puritanism, which had been denied to them in England and the rest of Europe, to engage in peaceful commerce with England and the native American Indians, and to Christianize the peoples of the Americas.
What were colonists who objected to the new tax program called?
Controversy between Great Britain and the colonies arose in the 1760s when Parliament sought, for the first time, to impose a direct tax on the colonies for the purpose of raising revenue.
Some colonists, known in the colonies as Whigs, objected to the new tax program, arguing that it was a violation of the British Constitution.
Britons and British Americans agreed that, according to the constitution, British subjects could not be taxed without the consent of their elected representatives.
In Great Britain, this meant that taxes could only be levied by Parliament.
Colonists, however, did not elect members of Parliament, and so American Whigs argued that the colonies could not be taxed by that body.
According to Whigs, colonists could only be taxed by their own colonial assemblies.
Colonial protests resulted in the repeal of the Stamp Act in 1765, but in the 1766 Declaratory Act, Parliament continued to insist that it had the right to legislate for the colonies "in all cases whatsoever".When new taxes were levied in the Townshend Revenue Act of 1767, Whig colonists again responded with protests and boycotts.
Merchants organized a non-importation agreement, and many colonists pledged to abstain from drinking British tea, with activists in New England promoting alternatives, such as domestic Labrador tea.
Smuggling continued apace, especially in New York and Philadelphia, where tea smuggling had always been more extensive than in Boston.
Dutied British tea continued to be imported into Boston, however, especially by Richard Clarke and the sons of Massachusetts Governor Thomas Hutchinson, until pressure from Massachusetts Whigs compelled them to abide by the non-importation agreement.Parliament finally responded to the protests by repealing the Townshend taxes in 1770, except for the tea duty, which Prime Minister Lord North kept to assert "the right of taxing the Americans".
This partial repeal of the taxes was enough to bring an end to the non-importation movement by October 1770.
From 1771 to 1773, British tea was once again imported into the colonies in significant amounts, with merchants paying the Townshend duty of three pence per pound.
Boston was the largest colonial importer of legal tea; smugglers still dominated the market in New York and Philadelphia.
What is the Malthusian trap?
Chronic hunger and malnutrition were the norm for the majority of the population of the world including Britain and France, until the latter part of the 19th century.
Until about 1750, in large part due to malnutrition, life expectancy in France was about 35 years, and only slightly higher in Britain.
The U.S. population of the time was adequately fed, were much taller and had life expectancy of 45–50 years.In Britain and the Netherlands food supply had been increasing and prices falling before the Industrial Revolution due to better agricultural practices; however, population was increasing as well, as noted by Thomas Malthus.
Prior to the Industrial Revolution, advances in agriculture or technology soon led to an increase in population, which again strained food and other resources, limiting increases in per capita income.
This condition is called the Malthusian trap, and it was finally overcome by industrialization.Transportation improvements, such as canals and improved roads, also lowered food costs.
Railroads were introduced near the end of the Industrial Revolution.
What is a key reason that scholars and economists want to identify causes of the Great Depression?
There were multiple causes for the first downturn in 1929.
These include the structural weaknesses and specific events that turned it into a major depression and the manner in which the downturn spread from country to country.
In relation to the 1929 downturn, historians emphasize structural factors like major bank failures and the stock market crash.
In contrast, monetarist economists (such as Barry Eichengreen, Milton Friedman and Peter Temin) point to monetary factors such as actions by the US Federal Reserve that contracted the money supply, as well as Britain's decision to return to the gold standard at pre–World War I parities (US$4.86:£1).Recessions and business cycles are thought to be a normal part of living in a world of inexact balances between supply and demand.
What turns a normal recession or 'ordinary' business cycle into a depression is a subject of much debate and concern.
Scholars have not agreed on the exact causes and their relative importance.
The search for causes is closely connected to the issue of avoiding future depressions.
A related question is whether the Great Depression was primarily a failure on the part of free markets or a failure of government efforts to regulate interest rates, curtail widespread bank failures, and control the money supply.Current theories may be broadly classified into two main points of view and several heterodox points of view.
There are demand-driven theories, most importantly Keynesian economics, but also including those who point to the breakdown of international trade, and Institutional economists who point to underconsumption and over-investment (causing an economic bubble), malfeasance by bankers and industrialists, or incompetence by government officials.
The consensus among demand-driven theories is that a large-scale loss of confidence led to a sudden reduction in consumption and investment spending.
Once panic and deflation set in, many people believed they could avoid further losses by keeping clear of the markets.
Holding money became profitable as prices dropped lower and a given amount of money bought ever more goods, exacerbating the drop in demand.There are the monetarists, who believe that the Great Depression started as an ordinary recession, but that significant policy mistakes by monetary authorities (especially the Federal Reserve), caused a shrinking of the money supply which greatly exacerbated the economic situation, causing a recession to descend into the Great Depression.
Related to this explanation are those who point to debt deflation causing those who borrow to owe ever more in real terms.There are also various heterodox theories that downplay or reject the explanations of the Keynesians and monetarists.
For example, some new classical macroeconomists have argued that various labor market policies imposed at the start caused the length and severity of the Great Depression.
The Austrian school of economics focuses on the macroeconomic effects of money supply, and how central banking decisions can lead to over-investment (economic bubble).
In 1989, the Communist governments from what countries became the first to negotiate the organizing of competitive elections?
By 1989, the Soviet alliance system was on the brink of collapse, and, deprived of Soviet military support, the Communist leaders of the Warsaw Pact states were losing power.
Grassroots organizations, such as Poland's Solidarity movement, rapidly gained ground with strong popular bases.
In 1989, the Communist governments in Poland and Hungary became the first to negotiate the organizing of competitive elections.
In Czechoslovakia and East Germany, mass protests unseated entrenched Communist leaders.
The Communist regimes in Bulgaria and Romania also crumbled, in the latter case as the result of a violent uprising.
Attitudes had changed enough that US Secretary of State James Baker suggested that the American government would not be opposed to Soviet intervention in Romania, on behalf of the opposition, to prevent bloodshed.
The tidal wave of change culminated with the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, which symbolized the collapse of European Communist governments and graphically ended the Iron Curtain divide of Europe.
The 1989 revolutionary wave swept across Central and Eastern Europe peacefully overthrew all the Soviet-style communist states: East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, Romania was the only Eastern-bloc country to topple its communist regime violently and execute its head of state.
How many homosexuals were sent to concentration camps?
Between 5,000 and 15,000 homosexuals of German nationality are estimated to have been sent to concentration camps.
James D. Steakley writes that what mattered in Germany was criminal intent or character, rather than criminal acts, and the ""gesundes Volksempfinden"" ("healthy sensibility of the people") became the leading normative legal principle.
In 1936, Himmler created the Reich Central Office for the Combating of Homosexuality and Abortion.
Homosexuality was declared contrary to "wholesome popular sentiment," and homosexuals were consequently regarded as "defilers of German blood."
The Gestapo raided gay bars, tracked individuals using the address books of those they arrested, used the subscription lists of gay magazines to find others, and encouraged people to report suspected homosexual behavior and to scrutinize the behavior of their neighbors.Tens of thousands were convicted between 1933 and 1944 and sent to camps for "rehabilitation", where they were identified by yellow armbands and later pink triangles worn on the left side of the jacket and the right trouser leg, which singled them out for sexual abuse.
Hundreds were castrated by court order.
They were humiliated, tortured, used in hormone experiments conducted by SS doctors, and killed.
Steakley writes that the full extent of gay suffering was slow to emerge after the war.
Many victims kept their stories to themselves because homosexuality remained criminalized in postwar Germany.
Around two percent of German homosexuals were persecuted by Nazis.
What is the name of the treaty that called for an immediate evacuation of German troops from Belgium, France, and Luxembourg within fifteen days and established that Allied forces would occupy the Rhineland?
The terms of the armistice called for an immediate evacuation of German troops from Belgium, France, and Luxembourg within fifteen days.
In addition, it established that Allied forces would occupy the Rhineland.
In late 1918, Allied troops entered Germany and began the occupation.
The Kiev water supply was switched to the Desna River how many months after the Chernobyl disaster?
Residual radioactivity in the environment.Rivers, lakes and reservoirs.The Chernobyl nuclear power plant is located next to the Pripyat River, which feeds into the Dnieper reservoir system, one of the largest surface water systems in Europe, which at the time supplied water to Kiev's 2.4 million residents, and was still in spring flood when the accident occurred.
The radioactive contamination of aquatic systems therefore became a major problem in the immediate aftermath of the accident.
In the most affected areas of Ukraine, levels of radioactivity (particularly from radionuclides 131I, 137Cs and 90Sr) in drinking water caused concern during the weeks and months after the accident, though officially it was stated that all contaminants had settled to the bottom "in an insoluble phase" and would not dissolve for 800–1,000 years.
Guidelines for levels of radioiodine in drinking water were temporarily raised to 3,700 Bq/L, allowing most water to be reported as safe, and a year after the accident it was announced that even the water of the Chernobyl plant's cooling pond was within acceptable norms.
Despite this, two months after the disaster the Kiev water supply was abruptly switched from the Dnieper to the Desna River.
Meanwhile, massive silt traps were constructed, along with an enormous 30m-deep underground barrier to prevent groundwater from the destroyed reactor entering the Pripyat River.Bio-accumulation of radioactivity in fish resulted in concentrations (both in western Europe and in the former Soviet Union) that in many cases were significantly above guideline maximum levels for consumption.
Guideline maximum levels for radiocaesium in fish vary from country to country but are approximately 1,000 Bq/kg in the European Union.
In the Kiev Reservoir in Ukraine, concentrations in fish were several thousand Bq/kg during the years after the accident.In small "closed" lakes in Belarus and the Bryansk region of Russia, concentrations in a number of fish species varied from 100 to 60,000 Bq/kg during the period 1990–92.
The contamination of fish caused short-term concern in parts of the UK and Germany and in the long term (years rather than months) in the affected areas of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia as well as in parts of Scandinavia.
Why did the Korean War feature few naval battles?
Because neither Korea had a large navy, the Korean War featured few naval battles; mostly the combatant navies served as naval artillery for their in-country armies.
A skirmish between North Korea and the UN Command occurred on 2 July 1950; the US Navy cruiser USS "Juneau", the Royal Navy cruiser HMS "Jamaica", and the frigate HMS "Black Swan" fought four North Korean torpedo boats and two mortar gunboats, and sank them.During most of the war, the UN navies patrolled the west and east coasts of North Korea and sank supply and ammunition ships to deny the sea to North Korea.
Aside from very occasional gunfire from North Korean shore batteries, the main threat to US and UN navy ships was from magnetic mines the North Koreans employed for defensive purposes.
During the war, five U.S. Navy ships were lost (two minesweepers, two minesweeper escorts, and one ocean tug) all of them to mines, while 87 other warships suffered from slight to moderate damage from North Korean coastal artillery.The USS "Juneau" sank ammunition ships that had been present in her previous battle.
The last sea battle of the Korean War occurred at Inchon, days before the Battle of Incheon; the ROK ship "PC 703" sank a North Korean mine layer in the Battle of Haeju Island, near Inchon.
Three other supply ships were sunk by "PC-703" two days later in the Yellow Sea.
When was the project 'Gemini' first introduced?
Focused by the commitment to a moon landing, in January 1962 the US introduced Project Gemini, a two-crew-member spacecraft that would support Apollo by developing the key spaceflight technologies of space rendezvous and docking of two craft, flight durations of sufficient length to simulate going to the Moon and back, Extra-vehicular Activity for extended periods, and accomplishing useful work rather than just "walking in space."
Although Gemini took a year longer than planned to accomplish its first flight, Gemini took advantage of the USSR's two-year hiatus after Voskhod, which enabled the US to catch up and surpass the previous Soviet lead in piloted spaceflight.
Gemini achieved several significant firsts during the course of ten piloted missions:
 On Gemini 3 (March 1965), astronauts Virgil "Gus" Grissom and John W. Young became the first to demonstrate their ability to change their craft's orbit.
 On Gemini 5 (August 1965), astronauts L. Gordon Cooper and Charles "Pete" Conrad set a record of almost eight days in space, long enough for a piloted lunar mission.
 On Gemini 6A (December 1965), Command Pilot Wally Schirra achieved the first space rendezvous with Gemini 7, accurately matching his orbit to that of the other craft, station-keeping for three consecutive orbits at distances as close as .
 Gemini 7 also set a human spaceflight endurance record of fourteen days for Frank Borman and James A. Lovell, which stood until both nations started launching space laboratories in the early 1970s.
 On Gemini 8 (March 1966), Command Pilot Neil Armstrong achieved the first docking between two spacecraft, his Gemini craft and an Agena target vehicle.
 Gemini 11 (September 1966), commanded by Conrad, achieved the first direct-ascent rendezvous with its Agena target on the first orbit, and used the Agena's rocket to achieve an apogee of .
 On Gemini 12 (November 1966), Edwin E. "Buzz" Aldrin spent over five hours working comfortably during three (EVA) sessions, finally proving that humans could perform productive tasks outside their spacecraft.
(This proved to be the most difficult goal to achieve.
)
Most of the novice pilots on the early missions would command the later missions.
In this way, Project Gemini built up spaceflight experience for the pool of astronauts who would be chosen to fly the Apollo lunar missions.
What is recombinant DNA?
Uses in technology.Genetic engineering.Methods have been developed to purify DNA from organisms, such as phenol-chloroform extraction, and to manipulate it in the laboratory, such as restriction digests and the polymerase chain reaction.
Modern biology and biochemistry make intensive use of these techniques in recombinant DNA technology.
Recombinant DNA is a man-made DNA sequence that has been assembled from other DNA sequences.
They can be transformed into organisms in the form of plasmids or in the appropriate format, by using a viral vector.
The genetically modified organisms produced can be used to produce products such as recombinant proteins, used in medical research, or be grown in agriculture.
How did scientists measure sea levels prior to instrumental measurements?
Global sea level change for much of the last century has generally been estimated using tide gauge measurements collated over long periods of time to give a long-term average.
More recently, altimeter measurements — in combination with accurately determined satellite orbits — have provided an improved measurement of global sea level change.
To measure sea levels prior to instrumental measurements, scientists have dated coral reefs that grow near the surface of the ocean, coastal sediments, marine terraces, ooids in limestones, and nearshore archaeological remains.
The predominant dating methods used are uranium series and radiocarbon, with cosmogenic radionuclides being sometimes used to date terraces that have experienced relative sea level fall.
In the early Pliocene, global temperatures were 1–2˚C warmer than the present temperature, yet sea level was 15–25 meters higher than today.
What kind of organisms have stem cells?
Stem cells are undifferentiated biological cells that can differentiate into specialized cells and can divide (through mitosis) to produce more stem cells.
They are found in multicellular organisms.
In mammals, there are two broad types of stem cells: embryonic stem cells, which are isolated from the inner cell mass of blastocysts, and adult stem cells, which are found in various tissues.
In adult organisms, stem cells and progenitor cells act as a repair system for the body, replenishing adult tissues.
In a developing embryo, stem cells can differentiate into all the specialized cells—ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm (see induced pluripotent stem cells)—but also maintain the normal turnover of regenerative organs, such as blood, skin, or intestinal tissues.There are three accessible sources of autologous adult stem cells in humans:
 Bone marrow, which requires extraction by "harvesting", that is, drilling into bone (typically the femur or iliac crest),
 Adipose tissue (lipid cells), which requires extraction by liposuction, and
 Blood, which requires extraction through apheresis, wherein blood is drawn from the donor (similar to a blood donation), and passed through a machine that extracts the stem cells and returns other portions of the blood to the donor.
Stem cells can also be taken from umbilical cord blood just after birth.
Of all stem cell types, autologous harvesting involves the least risk.
By definition, autologous cells are obtained from one's own body, just as one may bank his or her own blood for elective surgical procedures.Adult stem cells are frequently used in medical therapies, for example in bone marrow transplantation.
Stem cells can now be artificially grown and transformed (differentiated) into specialized cell types with characteristics consistent with cells of various tissues such as muscles or nerves.
Embryonic cell lines and autologous embryonic stem cells generated through therapeutic cloning have also been proposed as promising candidates for future therapies.
Research into stem cells grew out of findings by Ernest A. McCulloch and James E. Till at the University of Toronto in the 1960s.
What else is cloning known as?
Organism cloning (also called reproductive cloning) refers to the procedure of creating a new multicellular organism, genetically identical to another.
In essence this form of cloning is an asexual method of reproduction, where fertilization or inter-gamete contact does not take place.
Asexual reproduction is a naturally occurring phenomenon in many species, including most plants (see vegetative reproduction) and some insects.
Scientists have made some major achievements with cloning, including the asexual reproduction of sheep and cows.
There is a lot of ethical debate over whether or not cloning should be used.
However, cloning, or asexual propagation, has been common practice in the horticultural world for hundreds of years.
By what year is the population expected to double?
Under present trends, by 2030, maize production in Southern Africa could decrease by up to 30%, while rice, millet and maize in South Asia could decrease by up to 10%.
By 2080, yields in developing countries could decrease by 10% to 25% on average while India could see a drop of 30% to 40%.
By 2100, while the population of three billion is expected to double, rice and maize yields in the tropics are expected to decrease by 20–40% because of higher temperatures without accounting for the decrease in yields as a result of soil moisture and water supplies stressed by rising temperatures.Future warming of around (by 2100, relative to 1990–2000) could result in increased crop yields in mid- and high-latitude areas, but in low-latitude areas, yields could decline, increasing the risk of malnutrition.
A similar regional pattern of net benefits and costs could occur for economic (market-sector) effects.
Warming above could result in crop yields falling in temperate regions, leading to a reduction in global food production.
What are the different regions of the periodic table referred to?
The different regions of the periodic table are sometimes referred to as "blocks" in recognition of the sequence in which the electron shells of the elements are filled.
Each block is named according to the subshell in which the "last" electron notionally resides.
The s-block comprises the first two groups (alkali metals and alkaline earth metals) as well as hydrogen and helium.
The p-block comprises the last six groups which are groups 13 to 18 in IUPAC (3A to 8A in American) and contains, among other elements, all of the metalloids.
The d-block comprises groups 3 to 12 in IUPAC (or 3B to 2B in American group numbering) and contains all of the transition metals.
The f-block, usually offset below the rest of the periodic table, comprises the lanthanides and actinides.
What areas of interdisciplinary areas of research does physics intersect with?
Physics (from , from "phúsis" "nature") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force.
More broadly, it is the general analysis of nature, conducted in order to understand how the universe behaves.Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines, perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of astronomy.
Over the last two millennia, physics was a part of natural philosophy along with chemistry, certain branches of mathematics, and biology, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century, the natural sciences emerged as unique research programs in their own right.
Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry, and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined.
New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms of other sciences while opening new avenues of research in areas such as mathematics and philosophy.Physics also makes significant contributions through advances in new technologies that arise from theoretical breakthroughs.
For example, advances in the understanding of electromagnetism or nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products which have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.
What does Ecology study?
Ecology studies the distribution and abundance of living organisms, and the interactions between organisms and their environment.
The habitat of an organism can be described as the local abiotic factors such as climate and ecology, in addition to the other organisms and biotic factors that share its environment.
One reason that biological systems can be difficult to study is that so many different interactions with other organisms and the environment are possible, even on small scales.
A microscopic bacterium in a local sugar gradient is responding to its environment as much as a lion searching for food in the African savanna.
For any species, behaviors can be co-operative, competitive, parasitic, or symbiotic.
Matters become more complex when two or more species interact in an ecosystem.Ecological systems are studied at several different levels, from individuals and populations to ecosystems and the biosphere.
The term population biology is often used interchangeably with population ecology, although "population biology" is more frequently used when studying diseases, viruses, and microbes, while population ecology is more commonly used when studying plants and animals.
Ecology draws on many subdisciplines.Ethology studies animal behavior (particularly that of social animals such as primates and canids), and is sometimes considered a branch of zoology.
Ethologists have been particularly concerned with the evolution of behavior and the understanding of behavior in terms of the theory of natural selection.
In one sense, the first modern ethologist was Charles Darwin, whose book, "The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals," influenced many ethologists to come.Biogeography studies the spatial distribution of organisms on the Earth, focusing on topics like plate tectonics, climate change, dispersal and migration, and cladistics.
What types of mutation are usually selected against?
In addition to being a major source of variation, mutation may also function as a mechanism of evolution when there are different probabilities at the molecular level for different mutations to occur, a process known as mutation bias.
If two genotypes, for example one with the nucleotide G and another with the nucleotide A in the same position, have the same fitness, but mutation from G to A happens more often than mutation from A to G, then genotypes with A will tend to evolve.
Different insertion vs. deletion mutation biases in different taxa can lead to the evolution of different genome sizes.
Developmental or mutational biases have also been observed in morphological evolution.
For example, according to the phenotype-first theory of evolution, mutations can eventually cause the genetic assimilation of traits that were previously induced by the environment.Mutation bias effects are superimposed on other processes.
If selection would favor either one out of two mutations, but there is no extra advantage to having both, then the mutation that occurs the most frequently is the one that is most likely to become fixed in a population.
Mutations leading to the loss of function of a gene are much more common than mutations that produce a new, fully functional gene.
Most loss of function mutations are selected against.
But when selection is weak, mutation bias towards loss of function can affect evolution.
For example, pigments are no longer useful when animals live in the darkness of caves, and tend to be lost.
This kind of loss of function can occur because of mutation bias, and/or because the function had a cost, and once the benefit of the function disappeared, natural selection leads to the loss.
Loss of sporulation ability in a bacterium during laboratory evolution appears to have been caused by mutation bias, rather than natural selection against the cost of maintaining sporulation ability.
When there is no selection for loss of function, the speed at which loss evolves depends more on the mutation rate than it does on the effective population size, indicating that it is driven more by mutation bias than by genetic drift.
Where do birds have scales?
Birds are tetrapods but though their hind limbs are used for walking or hopping, their front limbs are wings covered with feathers and adapted for flight.
Birds are endothermic, have a high metabolic rate, a light skeletal system and powerful muscles.
The long bones are thin, hollow and very light.
Air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones.
The sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused.
There are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horn-covered beak.
The eyes are relatively large, particularly in nocturnal species such as owls.
They face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks.The feathers are outgrowths of the epidermis and are found in localized bands from where they fan out over the skin.
Large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail, contour feathers cover the bird's surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds.
The only cutaneous gland is the single uropygial gland near the base of the tail.
This produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird preens.
There are scales on the legs and feet and claws on the tips of the toes.
How did John Gower define the limits of astrology?
In the seventh century, Isidore of Seville argued in his "Etymologiae" that astronomy described the movements of the heavens, while astrology had two parts: one was scientific, describing the movements of the sun, the moon and the stars, while the other, making predictions, was theologically erroneous.
In contrast, John Gower in the fourteenth century defined astrology as essentially limited to the making of predictions.
The influence of the stars was in turn divided into natural astrology, with for example effects on tides and the growth of plants, and judicial astrology, with supposedly predictable effects on people.
The fourteenth century skeptic Nicole Oresme however included astronomy as a part of astrology in his "Livre de divinacions".
Oresme argued that current approaches to prediction of events such as plagues, wars, and weather were inappropriate, but that such prediction was a valid field of inquiry.
However, he attacked the use of astrology to choose the timing of actions (so-called interrogation and election) as wholly false, and rejected the determination of human action by the stars on grounds of free will.
The friar Laurens Pignon (c. 1368–1449) similarly rejected all forms of divination and determinism, including by the stars, in his 1411 "Contre les Devineurs".
This was in opposition to the tradition carried by the Arab astronomer Albumasar (787-886) whose "Introductorium in Astronomiam" and "De Magnis Coniunctionibus" argued the view that both individual actions and larger scale history are determined by the stars.
Does venus have any natural satellites?
 Venus (0.7 AU from the Sun) is close in size to Earth (0.815 Earth masses) and, like Earth, has a thick silicate mantle around an iron core, a substantial atmosphere, and evidence of internal geological activity.
It is much drier than Earth, and its atmosphere is ninety times as dense.
Venus has no natural satellites.
It is the hottest planet, with surface temperatures over 400 °C (752°F), most likely due to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
No definitive evidence of current geological activity has been detected on Venus, but it has no magnetic field that would prevent depletion of its substantial atmosphere, which suggests that its atmosphere is frequently replenished by volcanic eruptions.
During the six Apollo spaceflights, how many men walked on the Moon?
Project Apollo (1961–72).The U.S public's perception of the Soviet lead in putting the first man in space, motivated President John F. Kennedy to ask the Congress on May 25, 1961 to commit the federal government to a program to land a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s, which effectively launched the Apollo program.Apollo was one of the most expensive American scientific programs ever.
It is estimated to have cost $ in present-day US dollars.
(In comparison, the Manhattan Project cost roughly $, accounting for inflation.
)It used the Saturn rockets as launch vehicles, which were far bigger than the rockets built for previous projects.
The spacecraft was also bigger; it had two main parts, the combined command and service module (CSM) and the lunar landing module (LM).
The LM was to be left on the Moon and only the command module (CM) containing the three astronauts would eventually return to Earth.The second manned mission, Apollo 8, brought astronauts for the first time in a flight around the Moon in December 1968.
Shortly before, the Soviets had sent an unmanned spacecraft around the Moon.
On the next two missions docking maneuvers that were needed for the Moon landing were practiced and then finally the Moon landing was made on the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969.The first person to stand on the Moon was Neil Armstrong, who was followed by Buzz Aldrin, while Michael Collins orbited above.
Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon, the last in December 1972.
Throughout these six Apollo spaceflights, twelve men walked on the Moon.
These missions returned a wealth of scientific data and of lunar samples.
Topics covered by experiments performed included soil mechanics, meteoroids, seismology, heat flow, lunar ranging, magnetic fields, and solar wind.
The Moon landing marked the end of the space race and as a gesture, Armstrong mentioned mankind when he stepped down on the Moon.Apollo set major milestones in human spaceflight.
It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low Earth orbit, and landing humans on another celestial body.
Apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while Apollo 17 marked the last moonwalk and the last manned mission beyond low Earth orbit.
The program spurred advances in many areas of technology peripheral to rocketry and manned spaceflight, including avionics, telecommunications, and computers.
Apollo sparked interest in many fields of engineering and left many physical facilities and machines developed for the program as landmarks.
Many objects and artifacts from the program are on display at various locations throughout the world, notably at the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museums.
How many strands are in double-stranded RNA?
Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is RNA with two complementary strands, similar to the DNA found in all cells.
dsRNA forms the genetic material of some viruses (double-stranded RNA viruses).
Double-stranded RNA such as viral RNA or siRNA can trigger RNA interference in eukaryotes, as well as interferon response in vertebrates.
What is the function of the enzymes called "restriction endonucleases"?
Bacteriophages are a common and diverse group of viruses and are the most abundant form of biological entity in aquatic environments – there are up to ten times more of these viruses in the oceans than there are bacteria, reaching levels of 250,000,000 bacteriophages per millilitre of seawater.
These viruses infect specific bacteria by binding to surface receptor molecules and then entering the cell.
Within a short amount of time, in some cases just minutes, bacterial polymerase starts translating viral mRNA into protein.
These proteins go on to become either new virions within the cell, helper proteins, which help assembly of new virions, or proteins involved in cell lysis.
Viral enzymes aid in the breakdown of the cell membrane, and, in the case of the T4 phage, in just over twenty minutes after injection over three hundred phages could be released.The major way bacteria defend themselves from bacteriophages is by producing enzymes that destroy foreign DNA.
These enzymes, called restriction endonucleases, cut up the viral DNA that bacteriophages inject into bacterial cells.
Bacteria also contain a system that uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of viruses that the bacteria have come into contact with in the past, which allows them to block the virus's replication through a form of RNA interference.
This genetic system provides bacteria with acquired immunity to infection.
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance?
Some bacteria also transfer genetic material between cells.
This can occur in three main ways.
First, bacteria can take up exogenous DNA from their environment, in a process called transformation.
Genes can also be transferred by the process of transduction, when the integration of a bacteriophage introduces foreign DNA into the chromosome.
The third method of gene transfer is conjugation, whereby DNA is transferred through direct cell contact.Transduction of bacterial genes by bacteriophage appears to be a consequence of infrequent errors during intracellular assembly of virus particles, rather than a bacterial adaptation.
Conjugation, in the much-studied E. coli system is determined by plasmid genes, and is an adaptation for transferring copies of the plasmid from one bacterial host to another.
It is seldom that a conjugative plasmid integrates into the host bacterial chromosome, and subsequently transfers part of the host bacterial DNA to another bacterium.
Plasmid-mediated transfer of host bacterial DNA also appears to be an accidental process rather than a bacterial adaptation.Transformation, unlike transduction or conjugation, depends on numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact to perform this complex process, and thus transformation is clearly a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer.
In order for a bacterium to bind, take up and recombine donor DNA into its own chromosome, it must first enter a special physiological state termed competence (see Natural competence).
In "Bacillus subtilis" about 40 genes are required for the development of competence.
The length of DNA transferred during "B. subtilis" transformation can be between a third of a chromosome up to the whole chromosome.
Transformation appears to be common among bacterial species, and thus far at least 60 species are known to have the natural ability to become competent for transformation.
The development of competence in nature is usually associated with stressful environmental conditions, and seems to be an adaptation for facilitating repair of DNA damage in recipient cells.In ordinary circumstances, transduction, conjugation, and transformation involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria of the same species, but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences, such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance.
In such cases, gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called horizontal gene transfer and may be common under natural conditions.
Gene transfer is particularly important in antibiotic resistance as it allows the rapid transfer of resistance genes between different pathogens.
About what percentage of people are sensitive to biogenic amines, such as histamines?
Yeast is used in winemaking, where it converts the sugars present in grape juice (must) into ethanol.
Yeast is normally already present on grape skins.
Fermentation can be done with this endogenous "wild yeast," but this procedure gives unpredictable results, which depend upon the exact types of yeast species present.
For this reason, a pure yeast culture is usually added to the must; this yeast quickly dominates the fermentation.
The wild yeasts are repressed, which ensures a reliable and predictable fermentation.Most added wine yeasts are strains of "S. cerevisiae", though not all strains of the species are suitable.
Different "S. cerevisiae" yeast strains have differing physiological and fermentative properties, therefore the actual strain of yeast selected can have a direct impact on the finished wine.
Significant research has been undertaken into the development of novel wine yeast strains that produce atypical flavour profiles or increased complexity in wines.The growth of some yeasts, such as "Zygosaccharomyces" and "Brettanomyces", in wine can result in wine faults and subsequent spoilage.
"Brettanomyces" produces an array of metabolites when growing in wine, some of which are volatile phenolic compounds.
Together, these compounds are often referred to as ""Brettanomyces" character", and are often described as "antiseptic" or "barnyard" type aromas.
"Brettanomyces" is a significant contributor to wine faults within the wine industry.Researchers from University of British Columbia, Canada, have found a new strain of yeast that has reduced amines.
The amines in red wine and Chardonnay produce off-flavors and cause headaches and hypertension in some people.
About 30% of people are sensitive to biogenic amines, such as histamines.
What year did Van Leeuwenhoek discover micro-organisms?
The first detailed account of the interior construction of living tissue based on the use of a microscope did not appear until 1644, in Giambattista Odierna's "L'occhio della mosca", or "The Fly's Eye".It was not until the 1660s and 1670s that the microscope was used extensively for research in Italy, The Netherlands and England.
Marcelo Malpighi in Italy began the analysis of biological structures beginning with the lungs.
Robert Hooke's "Micrographia" had a huge impact, largely because of its impressive illustrations.
The greatest contribution came from Antonie van Leeuwenhoek who discovered red blood cells and spermatozoa and helped popularise microscopy as a technique.
On 9 October 1676, Van Leeuwenhoek reported the discovery of micro-organisms.In 1893 August Köhler developed a key technique for sample illumination, Köhler illumination, which is central to modern light microscopy.
This method of sample illumination gives rise to extremely even lighting and overcomes many limitations of older techniques of sample illumination.
Further developments in sample illumination came from Frits Zernike in 1953 for inventing Phase Contrast, and Georges Nomarski 1955 for his development of differential interference contrast illumination; both of which allow imaging of unstained, transparent samples.
What does a telescope mount do?
A telescope mount is a mechanical structure which supports a telescope.
Telescope mounts are designed to support the mass of the telescope and allow for accurate pointing of the instrument.
Many sorts of mounts have been developed over the years, with the majority of effort being put into systems that can track the motion of the stars as the Earth rotates.
The two main types of tracking mount are:
 Altazimuth mount
 Equatorial mount
What are X-ray binaries?
X-ray binaries are binary star systems that are luminous in the X-ray part of the spectrum.
These X-ray emissions are generally thought to be caused by one of the component stars being a compact object accreting matter from the other (regular) star.
The presence of an ordinary star in such a system provides a unique opportunity for studying the central object and determining if it might be a black hole.If such a system emits signals that can be directly traced back to the compact object, it cannot be a black hole.
The absence of such a signal does, however, not exclude the possibility that the compact object is a neutron star.
By studying the companion star it is often possible to obtain the orbital parameters of the system and obtain an estimate for the mass of the compact object.
If this is much larger than the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit (that is, the maximum mass a neutron star can have before collapsing) then the object cannot be a neutron star and is generally expected to be a black hole.The first strong candidate for a black hole, Cygnus X-1, was discovered in this way by Charles Thomas Bolton, Louise Webster and Paul Murdin in 1972.
Some doubt, however, remained due to the uncertainties resultant from the companion star being much heavier than the candidate black hole.
Currently, better candidates for black holes are found in a class of X-ray binaries called soft X-ray transients.
In this class of system the companion star is relatively low mass allowing for more accurate estimates in the black hole mass.
Moreover, these systems are only active in X-ray for several months once every 10–50 years.
During the period of low X-ray emission (called quiescence), the accretion disc is extremely faint allowing for detailed observation of the companion star during this period.
One of the best such candidates is V404 Cyg.
What does nebula mean in Latin?
A nebula (from Latin: "cloud"; pl.
"nebulae" or "nebulæ", with ligature, or "nebulas") is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases.
Originally, "nebula" was a name for any diffuse astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way.
The Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, was referred to as the "Andromeda Nebula" (and spiral galaxies in general as "spiral nebulae") before the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the early 20th century by Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble and others.
Nebulae are often star-forming regions, such as in the Eagle Nebula.
This nebula is depicted in one of NASA's most famous images, the "Pillars of Creation".
In these regions the formations of gas, dust, and other materials "clump" together to form larger masses, which attract further matter, and eventually will become massive enough to form stars.
The remaining materials are then believed to form planets, and other planetary system objects.
How far away is the "auroral zone" from the magnetic pole?
Typically the aurora appears either as a diffuse glow or as "curtains" that approximately extend in the east-west direction.
At some times, they form "quiet arcs"; at others ("active aurora"), they evolve and change constantly.
Each curtain consists of many parallel rays, each lined up with the local direction of the magnetic field lines, suggesting that auroras are shaped by Earth's magnetic field.
Indeed, satellites show that electrons are guided by magnetic field lines, spiraling around them while moving toward Earth.The similarity to curtains is often enhanced by folds called "striations".
When the field line guiding a bright auroral patch leads to a point directly above the observer, the aurora may appear as a "corona" of diverging rays, an effect of perspective.Although it was first mentioned by Ancient Greek explorer/geographer Pytheas, Hiorter and Celsius first described in 1741 evidence for magnetic control, namely, large magnetic fluctuations occurred whenever the aurora was observed overhead.
This indicates (it was later realized) that large electric currents were associated with the aurora, flowing in the region where auroral light originated.
Kristian Birkeland (1908) deduced that the currents flowed in the east-west directions along the auroral arc, and such currents, flowing from the dayside toward (approximately) midnight were later named "auroral electrojets" (see also Birkeland currents).Still more evidence for a magnetic connection are the statistics of auroral observations.
Elias Loomis (1860) and later in more detail Hermann Fritz (1881) and S. Tromholt (1882) established that the aurora appeared mainly in the "auroral zone", a ring-shaped region with a radius of approximately 2500 km around Earth's magnetic pole.
It was hardly ever seen near the geographic pole, which is about 2000 km away from the magnetic pole.
The instantaneous distribution of auroras ("auroral oval") is slightly different, centered about 3–5 degrees nightward of the magnetic pole, so that auroral arcs reach furthest toward the equator about an hour before midnight.
The aurora can be seen best at this time, called magnetic midnight, which occurs when an observer, the magnetic pole in question and the Sun are in alignment.In the 1970s, astrophysicist Joan Feynman deduced that auroras are a product of the interaction between the Earth's magnetosphere and the magnetic field of the solar wind.
Her work resulted from data collected by the Explorer 33 spacecraft.On 26 February 2008, THEMIS probes were able to determine, for the first time, the triggering event for the onset of magnetospheric substorms.
Two of the five probes, positioned approximately one third the distance to the moon, measured events suggesting a magnetic reconnection event 96 seconds prior to auroral intensification.
Dr. Vassilis Angelopoulos of the University of California, Los Angeles, the principal investigator for the THEMIS mission, claimed, "Our data show clearly and for the first time that magnetic reconnection is the trigger."
What type of cheese is typically used in a taco?
A mostly California variation where the (sometimes over-sized) corn tortilla is fried or deep-fried in oil (originally, lard).
The meat can be anything, such as ground beef, steak, shredded beef, chicken or pork (carnitas).
Ground beef is generally diluted with refried bean paste and/or potato, and heavily seasoned.
Steak will usually be heavily chili-marinated, diced beef tip ("asada").
The meat is generally topped with jack and/or cheddar cheese, lettuce and tomato (and sometimes avocado and/or sour cream), with salsa on top.
What was the burger restaurant Wimpy's rebranded as in 1989-1990?
Hamburgers in the UK and Ireland are very similar to their US cousins, and the High Street is dominated by the same big two chains as in the U.S. — McDonald's and Burger King.
The menus offered to both countries are virtually identical, although portion sizes tend to be smaller in the UK.
In Ireland the food outlet Supermacs is widespread throughout the country serving burgers as part of its menu.
In Ireland, Abrakebabra (started out selling kebabs) and Eddie Rocket's are also major chains.An original and indigenous rival to the big two U.S. giants was the quintessentially British fast-food chain Wimpy, originally known as Wimpy Bar (opened 1954 at the Lyon’s Corner House in Coventry Street London), which served its hamburgers on a plate with British-style chips, accompanied by cutlery and delivered to the customer's table.
In the late 1970s, to compete with McDonald's, Wimpy began to open American-style counter-service restaurants and the brand disappeared from many UK high streets when those restaurants were re-branded as Burger Kings between 1989–90 by the then-owner of both brands, Grand Metropolitan.
A management buyout in 1990 split the brands again and now Wimpy table-service restaurants can still be found in many town centers whilst new counter-service Wimpys are now often found at motorway service stations.Hamburgers are also available from mobile kiosks, particularly at outdoor events such as football matches.
Burgers from this type of outlet are usually served without any form of salad — only fried onions and a choice of tomato ketchup, mustard or brown sauce.Chip shops, particularly in the West Midlands, North-East, Scotland and Ireland, serve battered hamburgers called batter burgers.
This is where the burger patty, by itself, is deep-fat-fried in batter and is usually served with chips.Hamburgers and veggie burgers served with chips and salad, are standard pub grub menu items.
Many pubs specialize in "gourmet" burgers.
These are usually high quality minced steak patties, topped with items such as blue cheese, brie, avocado et cetera.
Some British pubs serve burger patties made from more exotic meats including venison burgers (sometimes nicknamed Bambi Burgers), bison burgers, ostrich burgers and in some Australian themed pubs even kangaroo burgers can be purchased.
These burgers are served in a similar way to the traditional hamburger but are sometimes served with a different sauce including redcurrant sauce, mint sauce and plum sauce.In the early 21st century "premium" hamburger chain and independent restaurants have arisen, selling burgers produced from meat stated to be of high quality and often organic, usually served to eat on the premises rather than to take away.
Chains include Gourmet Burger Kitchen, Ultimate Burger, Hamburger Union and Byron Hamburgers in London.
Independent restaurants such as Meatmarket and Dirty Burger developed a style of rich, juicy burger in 2012 which is known as a "dirty burger" or "third-wave burger".In recent years Rustlers has sold pre-cooked hamburgers re-heat able in a microwave oven in the United Kingdom.In the UK, as in North America and Japan, the term "burger" can refer simply to the patty, be it beef, some other kind of meat, or vegetarian.
Who is the the world's leading producer of frozen fries?
Spreading popularity.Frozen fries.The J. R. Simplot Company is credited with successfully commercializing French fries in frozen form during the 1940s.
Subsequently, in 1967, Ray Kroc of McDonald's contracted the Simplot company to supply them with frozen fries, replacing fresh-cut potatoes.In 2004, 29% of the United States' potato crop were used to make frozen fries – 90% consumed by the food services sector and 10% by retail.
It is estimated that 80% of households in the UK buy frozen fries each year.Canada's McCain Foods is the world's leading producer of frozen fries.
What does hong chang mean in Chinese?
Asia.China.A European-like-style smoked savory "hóng cháng" (红肠 "red sausage") is produced in Harbin, China's northernmost major city.
It is another notable product similar to Lithuanian and Polish sausages including kiełbasa and "podhalańska", in that they tend to be of a much more European flavours than other Chinese sausages.
This kind of sausage was first produced in a Russian-capitalized factory named Churin sausage factory in 1909, Since then Harbin style sausage become popular in China, especially in northern regions.Lap cheong (also lap chong, lap chung, lop chong) are dried pork sausages that look and feel like pepperoni, but are much sweeter.
In southwestern China, sausages are flavored with salt, red pepper and wild pepper.
People often cure sausages by smoking and air drying.
How many mg of sodium can four pieces of bacon contain?
One rasher of cooked streaky bacon contains of fat, and of protein.
Four pieces of bacon can also contain up to 800 mg of sodium, which is roughly equivalent to 1.92 grams of salt.
The fat and protein content varies depending on the cut and cooking method.68% of bacon's calories come from fat, almost half of which are saturated.
Each ounce of bacon contains 30 milligrams of cholesterol.
What is the traditional meat for a kebab?
Kebab (also kebap or kabab) is a Middle Eastern dish of pieces of meat, fish, or vegetables roasted or grilled on a skewer or spit originating in the Middle East, whereas in Europe it refers to doner kebab, sliced meat served in a pita.
In the Middle East, however, kebab refers to meat that is cooked over or next to flames; large or small cuts of meat, or even ground meat; it may be served on plates, in sandwiches, or in bowls.
The traditional meat for kebab is lamb, but depending on local tastes and religious prohibitions, other meats may include beef, goat, chicken, pork or fish.
Like other ethnic foods brought by travellers, the kebab has remained a part of everyday cuisine in most of the Eastern Mediterranean and South Asia.
It is also popular among Western youth as a snack after a night-out.
What are two flavors of Ramen?
In Akihabara, vending machines distribute warm ramen in a steel can, known as .
It is produced by a popular ramen restaurant and contains noodles, soup, menma, and pork.
It is intended as a quick snack, and includes a small folded plastic fork.
There are few kinds of flavor such as "tonkotsu" and curry.
Are uddon noodles a summer or winter dish?
Like many Japanese noodles, udon noodles are served chilled in the summer and hot in the winter.
Toppings are chosen to reflect the seasons.
Most toppings are added without much cooking, although some are deep-fried.
Many of these dishes may also be prepared with soba.
Who introduced rice to the Americas?
Rice is not native to the Americas but was introduced to Latin America and the Caribbean by European colonizers at an early date with Spanish colonizers introducing Asian rice to Mexico in the 1520s at Veracruz and the Portuguese and their African slaves introducing it at about the same time to Colonial Brazil.
Recent scholarship suggests that enslaved Africans played an active role in the establishment of rice in the New World and that African rice was an important crop from an early period.
Varieties of rice and bean dishes that were a staple dish along the peoples of West Africa remained a staple among their descendants subjected to slavery in the Spanish New World colonies, Brazil and elsewhere in the Americas.The Native Americans of what is now the Eastern United States may have practiced extensive agriculture with forms of wild rice.
What part of an animal is rib steak from?
A rib steak is a beef steak sliced from the rib primal of a beef animal, with rib bone attached.
In the United States, the term rib eye steak is used for a rib steak with the bone removed; however in some areas, and outside the U.S., the terms are often used interchangeably.
The rib eye or "ribeye" was originally, as the name implies, the center best portion of the rib steak, without the bone.
In 1699, who attempted to encourage his countrymen to eat salads?
The Romans and ancient Greeks ate mixed greens with dressing.
In his 1699 book, "Acetaria: A Discourse on Sallets", John Evelyn attempted with little success to encourage his fellow Britons to eat fresh salad greens.
Mary, Queen of Scots, ate boiled celery root over greens covered with creamy mustard dressing, truffles, chervil, and slices of hard-boiled eggs.The United States popularized mixed greens salads in the late 19th century; other regions of the world adopted them throughout the second half of the 20th century.
From Europe and the Americas to China, Japan, and Australia, salads are sold in supermarkets, at restaurants and at fast food chains.
In the US market, restaurants will often have a "Salad Bar" laid out with salad-making ingredients, which the customers will use to put together their salad.
What does every cornel of popcorn contain?
Each kernel of popcorn contains a certain amount of moisture and oil.
Unlike most other grains, the outer hull of the popcorn kernel is both strong and impervious to moisture and the starch inside consists almost entirely of a hard, dense type.As the oil and the water around the kernel are heated, they turn the moisture in the kernel, which has a moisture-proof hull, into a superheated pressurized steam.
Under these conditions, the starch inside the kernel gelatinizes, softens, and becomes pliable.
The pressure continues to increase until the breaking point of the hull is reached: a pressure of about and a temperature of .
The hull ruptures rapidly, causing a sudden drop in pressure inside the kernel and a corresponding rapid expansion of the steam, which expands the starch and proteins of the endosperm into airy foam.
As the foam rapidly cools, the starch and protein polymers set into the familiar crispy puff.
Special varieties are grown to give improved popping yield.
Some wild types will pop, but the cultivated strain is "Zea mays everta", which is a special kind of flint corn.
Is Cake Flour tends to make cakes with Less Or Higher dense textures?
 flour.Special cake flour with a high starch-to-gluten ratio is made from fine-textured, soft, low-protein wheat.
It is strongly bleached, and compared to all-purpose flour, cake flour tends to result in cakes with a lighter, less dense texture.
Therefore, it is frequently specified or preferred in cakes meant to be soft, light, and or bright white, such as angel food cake.
However, if cake flour is called for, a substitute can be made by replacing a small percentage of all-purpose flour with cornstarch or removing two tablespoons from each cup of all-purpose flour.
Some recipes explicitly specify or permit all-purpose flour, notably where a firmer or denser cake texture is desired.
What was Agnes Marshall's profession when she helped popularize ice cream?
 cone.
"Mrs Marshall's Cookery Book," published in 1888, endorsed serving ice cream in cones, but the idea definitely predated that.
Agnes Marshall was a celebrated cookery writer of her day and helped to popularise ice cream.
She patented and manufactured an ice cream maker and was the first person to suggest using liquefied gases to freeze ice cream after seeing a demonstration at the Royal Institution.Reliable evidence proves that ice cream cones were served in the 19th century, and their popularity increased greatly during the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904.
According to legend, at the World's Fair an ice cream seller had run out of the cardboard dishes used to put ice cream scoops in, so they could not sell any more produce.
Next door to the ice cream booth was a Syrian waffle booth, unsuccessful due to intense heat; the waffle maker offered to make cones by rolling up his waffles and the new product sold well, and was widely copied by other vendors.

What components of cheese helps prevent tooth decy?
Some studies claim that cheddar, mozzarella, Swiss and American cheeses can help to prevent tooth decay.
Several mechanisms for this protection have been proposed:
 The calcium, protein, and phosphorus in cheese may act to protect tooth enamel.
 Cheese increases saliva flow, washing away acids and sugars.
What did historian Mark Pendergrast describe coffee as?
Coffee is bought and sold by roasters, investors, and price speculators as a tradable commodity in commodity markets and exchange-traded funds.
Coffee futures contracts for Grade 3 washed arabicas are traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange under ticker symbol KC, with contract deliveries occurring every year in March, May, July, September, and December.
Coffee is an example of a product that has been susceptible to significant commodity futures price variations.Higher and lower grade arabica coffees are sold through other channels.
Futures contracts for robusta coffee are traded on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange and, since 2007, on the New York IntercontinentalExchange.
Coffee has been described by many, including historian Mark Pendergrast, as the world's "second most legally traded commodity."
However, this claim has been recently refuted by Pendergrast among others after further research.
What are three ingredients that are sometimes used as "boosters" for beverages at a juice bar?
 bars.A juice bar is an establishment that primarily serves prepared juice beverages such as freshly squeezed or extracted fruit juices, juice blends, fruit smoothies (a thick fruit drink, often iced), or other juices such as fresh wheatgrass juice.
Sometimes other solid ingredients or nutritional supplements may be added as boosters, such as fresh bananas, eggs, nuts or nut butter, bodybuilding supplements, soy protein powder or others such as whey or hemp protein powders, wheat germ, or Spirulina (dietary supplement) or Chlorella.
Also if less juice is used with these same ingredients drinks called health shakes may be produced.Juice bars share some of the characteristics of a coffeehouse, a soda fountain, a café, and a snack bar.Juice bars may be stand alone businesses in cities, or located at gyms, along commuter areas, near lunch time areas, at beaches, and at tourist attractions.In Mexico, juice bars have become more popular in recent times.
Mexican juice bars will often sell healthy beverages and snacks that are popular in Mexico.

When did the Beatles give up touring?
History.Concept.By late 1968, more than two years after the Beatles gave up touring, Paul McCartney was eager for the group to perform live again.
The sessions for that year's "The Beatles" (commonly known as the "White Album") had seen a number of serious arguments and strained relations among the group.
McCartney felt that the group's cohesiveness had been lost through years without playing live, and from using the studio not to record ensemble performances but to make increasingly complex recordings made up of parts played individually by each Beatle as overdubs rather than as a group.
He believed that the best way to improve band relations and revive enthusiasm was to get the group back into rehearsal as quickly as possible (the "White Album" sessions having only been concluded in October 1968) and begin work on a new album that made little or no use of studio artifice or multiple overdubbing.
This would allow the group to return to their roots by playing as a true ensemble, perhaps recording some or all of the new album during a one-off live concert or full concert tour.
This idea mirrored the "back to basics" attitude of a number of rock musicians at this time in reaction against the psychedelic and progressive music dominant in the previous two years.
McCartney believed that a return to live performance would reinstill the same sort of ensemble spirit and sense of unity that they had in their early years together.McCartney also decided to invite producer/engineer Glyn Johns to contribute to the recording.
His proposed role was apparently not clearly defined, as McCartney also wished to retain the services of George Martin.
As a result, Johns was not entirely sure whether he was supposed to be producing (or co-producing) the album or merely engineering it, with Martin having no clear idea of where he stood either.The other three Beatles were less enthusiastic about McCartney's proposals.
They had just completed five months' work on their previous album and were skeptical about the prospects of returning to live performance.
George Harrison in particular was very opposed to the idea of touring, having taken the strongest dislike out of any in the group due to the grueling tours of the Beatlemania era.
However he had recently enjoyed a series of jam sessions with Bob Dylan and the Band in the US, rediscovering his liking for straightforward ensemble playing, and he was attracted to the idea of the "back to basics" approach.
The same approach greatly appealed to John Lennon, who had grown increasingly wary of what he regarded as the excessive technical artifice used on their recordings since "Revolver" and had also made a recent return to no-frills ensemble playing in the shape of an appearance on "The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus".
In addition, all the group members had greatly enjoyed the recording of Lennon's song "Happiness is a Warm Gun" during the recent "White Album" sessions which, due to its multiple sections and myriad time signature changes, had required the Beatles to focus sharply and revive their ensemble playing skills to lay down a coherent basic rhythm track before any overdubbing could be applied.
In the end, the group agreed to convene for rehearsals immediately following New Year's Day 1969 to begin work, even though no suitable conclusion or even firm direction for the new project had been agreed upon.
Who wrote Macarthur Park?
"Hey Jude" was released on 26 August 1968 in the United States and 30 August in the United Kingdom, backed with "Revolution" on the B-side of a 7" single.
The single was the debut release of the Beatles' record label Apple Records; in the US, it was also the first Beatles' single to be issued in a company sleeve rather than a picture sleeve.
Even though "Hey Jude" was recorded during the sessions for the album "The Beatles", also known as the White Album, it was always intended as a single and not an album track, although it would eventually make its LP debut two years later as the title cut on the compilation album originally titled "The Beatles Again".
Lennon wanted "Revolution" to be the A-side of the single, but the other Beatles did not agree.
In his 1970 interview with "Rolling Stone", he said "Hey Jude" was worthy of an A-side, "but we could have had both."
Ten years later in 1980, he told "Playboy" he still disagreed with the decision.
"Hey Jude" began its sixteen-week run on the British charts on 7 September 1968, claiming the top spot a week later.
It only lasted two weeks on top before being knocked off by another single from Apple, Mary Hopkin's "Those Were the Days" (a song which, incidentally, if not penned was actually produced by McCartney).
The single was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on 13 September; that same week "NME" reported that two million copies of the single had been sold.
The song entered the US charts on 14 September 1968, where it stayed for nineteen weeks.
Two weeks later, "Hey Jude" was number one in the charts and held that position for nine weeks, the longest time spent by a Beatles' single at number one, as well as being the longest-playing single to reach number one.
The song was the 16th number one hit for the band in the US, tying Elvis Presley's record at the time for most number one songs there.
"Hey Jude" clocked in at 7:11.
The only other chart-topping song worldwide in the 1960s that ran over seven minutes was Richard Harris' "MacArthur Park".
In the UK, where "MacArthur Park" did not top the chart, "Hey Jude" remained the longest number-one hit for nearly a quarter of a century, until it was surpassed in 1993 by Meat Loaf's "I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)", which ran 7:58 as a single.On 30 November 1968, "NME" reported that sales had reached nearly six million copies worldwide.
"Hey Jude" became the biggest-selling debut release for a record label ever, selling an estimated eight million copies worldwide and topping the charts in eleven countries.
"Hey Jude" was the top Billboard Hot 100 single for 1968, according to year-end charts.
Less than three weeks after its release, the record was certified gold for sales of one million copies.
In 1999, it was certified 4x platinum, representing four million units shipped.
Beatallica is a parody of the Beatles and what other band?
 Neil Innes' The Rutles also pastiched the song as "Hold My Hand" in 1978.
 For the 2006 album "Love", George Martin and his son, Giles, melded the original studio recording with a live performance at the Hollywood Bowl, complete with screaming hordes of teenage girls.
 Beatallica, a parody of both the Beatles and Metallica, recorded a parody titled "I Want To Choke Your Band".
 In Disneyland's original "Star Tours" attraction, a maintenance droid listens to a song called "I Want to Weld Your Hand.

AOL Radio considered the song the best of 2010 hip hop music, regarding Eminem as imaginative and passionate.
It ranked ninth on MTV News' top-twenty-five list.
Its editor James Montgomery attributed the song's success to its theme and relation to the artists' past abusive relationships.
He concluded, "You cannot write a song any better than that, because that's how this kind of thing happens in real life."
"The New York Post" placed the song at second place on their "top 210 songs from 2010" list and regarded it as a "comeback club anthem."
In April 2011, Gabriel Alvarez of "Complex" magazine ranked it at number 100 on their "100 Best Eminem Songs" list, calling it a love song and praising Rihanna's vocals as beautiful.
"Love the Way You Lie" and its accompanying music video were nominated for five Grammy Awards at the 2011 ceremony, including "Record of the Year", "Song of the Year" and "Best Short Form Music Video".
It won the People's Choice Awards for "Favorite Music Video" and "Favorite Song".
Who originally performed 'All I want for Christmas is You?'
"All I Want for Christmas Is You" is a song originally performed by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey.
It was released by Columbia Records in 1994 as the lead single from her fourth studio album, "Merry Christmas".
Carey co-wrote and co-produced the song with Walter Afanasieff.
An uptempo love song, the instrumentation includes bell chimes and heavy back-up vocals, as well as use of synthesizers.
The song's lyrics declare that the protagonist does not care about Christmas presents or lights; all she wants for Christmas is to be united with her lover for the holidays.Two music videos were commissioned for the song, both being filmed during the month of December 1993.
The song's primary music video features grainy home footage of Carey, her dogs and family during the holiday season, as well as Carey dressed in a Santa suit frolicking on a snowy mountainside.
Then husband Tommy Mottola makes a cameo appearance as Santa Claus, bringing Carey a gift and leaving on a red sleigh.
The second video was filmed in black and white format, and features Carey dressed in 1960s style, while paying homage to The Ronettes, alongside back up singers and male dancers.Carey performed "All I Want for Christmas is You" during a slew of live television appearances and tours throughout her career.
She first sang it live during the Japanese leg of her Daydream World Tour (1996), Butterfly World Tour (1998) and (2003–04), as well as the Walt Disney World Christmas Day Parade in 2004 and 2010.
Both live appearances were aired on ABC.So So Def released a remix version in 2000, and a dance mix in 2009.
In 2010, Carey re-recorded the song for her second holiday album, "Merry Christmas II You", titled "All I Want for Christmas Is You (Extra Festive)".
In 2011, Carey re-recorded the song as duet with Justin Bieber, titled "All I Want for Christmas for You (SuperFestive!)".
The song has also been covered by many artists over the years, including Demi Lovato, Shania Twain, Michael Bublé, The Cheetah Girls, Cee Lo Green with Big Time Rush, Lady Antebellum, Nota, Miley Cyrus, The Electrical Fire, Atomic Tom, John Mayer and "Glee"'s Amber Riley.Critically, "All I Want for Christmas Is You" has been lauded, with "The New Yorker" calling it "one of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon".
The song was commercially successful, reaching the No.
2 position on the singles charts of Australia, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom, and the top 10 in several other countries.
It became the nineteenth-best-selling digital single of the 20th century, the highest-charting entry by a female or holiday song on the list.
"The Daily Telegraph" hailed "All I Want for Christmas Is You" as the most popular and most played Christmas song of the decade in the United Kingdom.
"Rolling Stone" ranked it fourth on its Greatest Rock and Roll Christmas Songs list, calling it a "holiday standard."
With global sales of over 14 million copies, the song remains Carey's biggest international hit and one of the best-selling singles of all time.
What version of 'Jingle Bell rock' is the most known in the world?
"Jingle Bell Rock" has been performed by many, but Helms' version is the most known in the world.
Its title and some of its lyrics are takeoffs on the old Christmas standard, "Jingle Bells."
It makes brief references to other popular songs of the 1950s, such as "Rock Around the Clock," and mentions going to a "Jingle hop."
An electric guitar played by Hank Garland can be heard playing the first notes to the chorus from "Jingle Bells.
"Despite being titled a Jingle Bell "Rock", Helms' version of the song was performed in the crossover style known as rockabilly.Bobby Helms' original version on Decca 9-30513 from 1957, was re-recorded by him on Kapp K-719 in 1965 and yet again in 1967 on Little Darlin' LD-0038.
In 1970, Helms recorded an entire album titled "Jingle Bell Rock" on Certron C-7013, releasing from the album the title track on Certron C-10021 with a picture sleeve.
In yet another re-recording, Helms released a version on Ashley AS-4200 (year unknown).
In 1983, Bobby Helms released his last recording of "Jingle Bell Rock" on Black Rose 82713.
What line did Frank Sinatra ask Martin to revise to make it more jolly?
Some of the original lyrics that were penned by Martin were rejected before the show began.
They were: "Have yourself a merry little Christmas / It may be your last/ Next year we may all be living in the past / Have yourself a merry little Christmas / Pop that champagne cork / Next year we may all be living in New York."
When presented with the original draft lyric, Garland, her co-star Tom Drake and director Vincente Minnelli criticized the song as depressing, and asked Martin to change the lyrics.Though he initially resisted, Martin made several changes to make the song more upbeat.
For example, the lines "It may be your last / Next year we may all be living in the past" became "Let your heart be light / Next year all our troubles will be out of sight".
Garland's version of the song, which was also released as a single by Decca Records, became popular among United States troops serving in World War II; her performance at the Hollywood Canteen brought many soldiers to tears.In 1957, Frank Sinatra asked Martin to revise the line "Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow."
He told Martin, "The name of my album is "A Jolly Christmas".
Do you think you could jolly up that line for me?"
Martin's new line was "Hang a shining star upon the highest bough."
Martin made several other alterations, changing the song's focus to a celebration of present happiness, rather than anticipation of a better future.
On "The Judy Garland Show Christmas Special", Garland sings the song to her children Joey and Lorna Luft with Sinatra's alternate lyrics.The lyrics Garland sang in "Meet Me in St. Louis" have been recorded with only slight variations by a number of artists, including Sinatra himself (in 1950 and 1963 single recordings), Doris Day (in "The Doris Day Christmas Album"), Ella Fitzgerald (in "Ella Wishes You a Swinging Christmas"), James Taylor (in "October Road"), The Pretenders in the first "A Very Special Christmas" compilation released in 1987 (which benefits Special Olympics), and Luther Vandross (in "This Is Christmas").In 2001 the 86-year-old composer Hugh Martin, occasionally active as a pianist with religious ministries since the 1980s, wrote an entirely new set of lyrics to the song with John Fricke, "Have Yourself a Blessed Little Christmas," a religious version of the secular Christmas standard.
The song was recorded by gospel female vocalist Del Delker with Martin accompanying her on piano.In 2002, NewSong lead singer Michael O'Brien noted the line "through the years, we all will be together if the Lord allows," which was part of the original song, was purged and replaced with "if the fates allow" to remove religious reference when the song was released.
He noted while a pastor in a California church in 1990, he had met Martin, who played piano at the church where O'Brien was serving for an evening, and the pastor was told, "That's the original way I wrote it, so I want you to sing it this way."
In addition to NewSong, Rachael Lampa, Twila Paris, Kathy Troccoli, Phil Wickham, BarlowGirl, Sidewalk Prophets, and Don Moen have recorded the song with the original lyrics.
Who filed a lawsuit against Fox Broadcasting Company on 10/24/2006?
On October 24, 2006, the Associated Press reported that Donald and Robert Hughes filed a lawsuit against Fox Broadcasting Company and the show's executive producer and creator, Paul Scheuring, for copyright infringement, seeking unspecified damages and other costs.
They claimed that in 2001, they had sent Fox their manuscript which was based on their own experiences of a prison break at a juvenile facility.
In the 1960s, Donald Hughes planned and successfully executed a prison escape for his brother, Robert Hughes, who was wrongfully incarcerated.

Who voiced Howard's never seen mother?
In scenes set at Howard's home in which he interacts with his never-seen mother (voiced by Carol Ann Susi), he always does so via shouting conversations between the rooms in his house, and she similarly interacts with other characters in this manner, though she did appear momentarily in the overhead photo of Howard and Bernadette's wedding and from the side in "The Spoiler Alert Segmentation" episode, though her face was not shown.
She reflects the Jewish mother stereotype in some ways, such as being overly controlling of Howard's adult life and sometimes trying to make him feel guilty about causing her trouble.
She is dependent on Howard, as she requires him to help her with her wig and makeup in the morning.
Howard in turn is attached to his mother to the point where she still cuts his meat for him, takes him to the dentist, does his laundry and "grounds" him when he returns home after briefly moving out.
Until Howard's marriage to Bernadette in the fifth season finale, Howard's former living situation led Leonard's psychiatrist mother to speculate that he may suffer from some type of pathology, and Sheldon to refer to their relationship as Oedipal.
Her tendency to communicate with Howard by shouting between rooms has led Bernadette and Raj to do impressions of her, and Bernadette to attempt to communicate with her in one episode by imitating her style of shouting.
Who stared in the 1985 comedy "Teen Wolf"?
Teen Wolf is a 1985 American fantasy comedy film released by Atlantic Releasing Corporation starring Michael J.
Fox as Scott Howard, a high school student who discovers that his family has an unusual pedigree when he finds himself transforming into a werewolf.
The film was directed by Rod Daniel based on a script co-written by Joseph Loeb III, Matthew Weisman, and Tim Hayes.
how many scenes were put under scrutiny?
Donna Nelson, a professor of organic chemistry at the University of Oklahoma, checked scripts and provided dialogue.
She also drew chemical structures and wrote chemical equations which were used as props.
According to creator Vince Gilligan, "Dr. Donna Nelson from the University of Oklahoma approached us several seasons back and said, 'I really like this show, and if you ever need help with the chemistry, I'd love to lend a hand.'
She's been a wonderful advisor.
We get help wherever we need it, whether it's chemistry, electrical engineering, or physics.
We try to get everything correct.
There's no full-time on set, but we run certain scenes by these experts first."
"[Because Walter White was talking to his students, I was able to dumb down certain moments of description and dialogue in the early episodes which held me until we had some help from some honest-to-God chemists," says Gilligan.
According to Gilligan, Nelson "vets our scripts to make sure our chemistry dialogue is accurate and up to date.
We also have a chemist with the Drug Enforcement Administration based out of Dallas who has just been hugely helpful to us."
Nelson spoke of Gilligan's interest in having the science right: " said it made a difference to him.
"In 2013, two scenes from the first season of "Breaking Bad" were put under scrutiny in a "Mythbusters" "Breaking Bad" Special.
Despite several modifications to what was seen in the show, both myths were busted.Jason Wallach of Vice magazine commended the accuracy of the cooking methods presented in the series.
In early episodes, a once common clandestine route, the Nagai red phosphorus/iodine method, is depicted, which uses pseudoephedrine as a precursor to d-(+)-methamphetamine.
By the seventh episode of season 1 "A No Rough-Stuff-Type Deal" Walt chooses to use a different synthetic route based on the difficulty of acquiring enough pseudoephedrine to produce on the larger scale required.
The new method Walt chooses is a reductive amination reaction, relying on phenyl-2-propanone and methylamine.
On the show the phenyl-2-propane, otherwise known as phenylacetone or P2P is produced from phenylacetic acid and acetic acid using a tube furnace and thorium dioxide or ThO2 as a catalyst as mentioned in episodes "A No Rough-Stuff-Type Deal" and "Más".
P2P and methylamine form an imine intermediate, reduction of this P2P-methylamine imine intermediate is performed using mercury aluminum amalgam as shown in several episodes including "Hazard Pay".
When was the series premire?
The series premiere on September 10, 2009 gave The CW its biggest series premiere scoring 4.91 million viewers.
Adding in DVR numbers, the ratings for the premiere swelled to an official 5.7 million viewers.The following is a table for the seasonal rankings, based on average total estimated viewers per episode of "The Vampire Diaries".
"Rank" refers to how "The Vampire Diaries" rated compared to the other television series which aired during prime time hours.
Who campaigned against the show "Dr.Who" due to content?
It has been suggested that the transmission of the first episode was delayed by ten minutes due to extended news coverage of the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy the previous day; whereas in fact, it went out just eighty seconds late.
Because it was believed that the coverage of the events of the assassination as well as a series of power blackouts across the country may have caused too many viewers to miss this introduction to a new series, the BBC broadcast it again on 30 November 1963, just before the broadcast of episode two.The programme soon became a national institution in the United Kingdom, with a large following among the general viewing audience.
Many renowned actors asked for, or were offered and accepted, guest-starring roles in various stories.With popularity came controversy over the show's suitability for children.
Morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse repeatedly complained to the BBC in the 1970s over what she saw as the show's frightening and gory content.
John Nathan-Turner, who produced the series during the 1980s, was heard to say that he looked forward to Whitehouse's comments, as the show's ratings would increase soon after she had made them.The phrase "Hiding behind (or 'watching from behind') the sofa" became coined and entered British pop culture, signifying in humour the stereotypical early-series behaviour of children who wanted to avoid seeing frightening parts of a television programme while remaining in the room to watch the remainder of it.
The phrase retains this association with Doctor Who, to the point that in 1991 the Museum of the Moving Image in London named their exhibition celebrating the programme "Behind the Sofa".
The electronic theme music too was perceived as eerie, novel, and frightening, at the time.
A 2012 article placed this childhood juxtapose of fear and thrill "at the center of many people's relationship with the show", and a 2011 online vote at Digital Spy deemed the series the "scariest TV show of all time".During Jon Pertwee's second series as the Doctor, in the serial "Terror of the Autons" (1971), images of murderous plastic dolls, daffodils killing unsuspecting victims, and blank-featured policemen marked the apex of the show's ability to frighten children.
Other notable moments in that decade include a disembodied brain falling to the floor in "The Brain of Morbius" and the Doctor apparently being drowned by Chancellor Goth in "The Deadly Assassin" (both 1976).A BBC audience research survey conducted in 1972 found that, by their own definition of violence ("any act which may cause physical and/or psychological injury, hurt or death to persons, animals or property, whether intentional or accidental") "Doctor Who" was the most violent of the drama programmes the corporation produced at the time.
The same report found that 3% of the surveyed audience regarded the show as "very unsuitable" for family viewing.
Responding to the findings of the survey in "The Times" newspaper, journalist Philip Howard maintained that, "to compare the violence of "Dr Who", sired by a horse-laugh out of a nightmare, with the more realistic violence of other television series, where actors who look like human beings bleed paint that looks like blood, is like comparing Monopoly with the property market in London: both are fantasies, but one is meant to be taken seriously.
"The image of the TARDIS has become firmly linked to the show in the public's consciousness; BBC scriptwriter Anthony Coburn, who lived in the resort of Herne Bay, Kent, was one of the people who conceived the idea of a police box as a time machine.
In 1996, the BBC applied for a trade mark to use the TARDIS's blue police box design in merchandising associated with "Doctor Who".
In 1998, the Metropolitan Police Authority filed an objection to the trade mark claim; but in 2002, the Patent Office ruled in favour of the BBC.</ref>The programme's broad appeal attracts audiences of children and families as well as science fiction fans.The 21st century revival of the programme has become the centrepiece of BBC One's Saturday schedule, and has, "defined the channel".
Since its return, "Doctor Who" has consistently received high ratings, both in number of viewers and as measured by the Appreciation Index.
In 2007, Caitlin Moran, television reviewer for "The Times", wrote that "Doctor Who" is, "quintessential to being British".
Director Steven Spielberg has commented that, "the world would be a poorer place without "Doctor Who"".On 4 August 2013, a live programme titled "Doctor Who Live: The Next Doctor" was broadcast on BBC One, during which the actor playing the Twelfth Doctor was revealed.
The show was simultaneously broadcast in the US and Australia.
Who plays Piper Chapman in Orange is the New Black?
The series revolves around Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling), a woman living in New York City who is sentenced to 15 months in a women's federal prison for transporting a suitcase full of drug money to her former girlfriend, Alex Vause (Laura Prepon), who is an international drug smuggler.

What does the second season explore?
The second season mainly explores the senior year of the characters with the premiere at the Hamptons and primarily focused on the relationship between Blair and Chuck, who were labeled "the heart of "GG"" by "People" magazine.
At first, both characters negate their feelings for one another, and go through random schemes and manipulations.The first half of the season deals with Serena's growing prominence as a socialite which draws the attention of Blair as their friendship is tested when the character of Poppy Lifton (Tamara Feldman) arrives, a socialite who inadvertently drives a wedge between Serena and Blair after inspiring Serena to take her place in the spotlight during the early episodes of the season.
Nate faces the aftermath of his father's criminal past and pursues a relationship with Vanessa, who becomes further entangled into the world of the Upper East Side.
Jenny reignites her rebellious nature by pursuing a career as a fashion designer, thereby challenging Rufus' skills as a parent while Dan's friendship with Nate and relationship with Serena slowly transforms him from a social outcast to an insider.
The show finished its first half during the first week of December, with the shocking death of Bart Bass.The second half of the season reveals the impact of Bart's death, causing a significant change of character direction for Chuck that subsequently leads to the growth of Rufus and Lily's relationship, the revelation of the two having a son together, and contributing to the decline of Dan and Serena's relationship.
John Shea reprised his role as Harold Waldorf during a Thanksgiving episode and becomes entangled in Blair's striving ambition of attending Yale.
Desmond Harrington entered the series as Chuck's manipulative uncle, Jack Bass.
Feldman returned to the season with Armie Hammer as Serena's new love interest, Gabriel Edwards.
Michelle Trachtenberg returned to the role of Georgina Sparks and filmed her scenes during February, also adjoining her character's return to the second season mystery.A backdoor pilot for a spin-off premiered in May, but was not picked up by The CW to the limited number of spots available on their fall line-up.As the storylines progressed, the role of "Gossip Girl" is slightly decreased.
She continues to run her blog, but she keeps the ultimate information for herself, sending it in the final episode as the last blast, where Serena decides to find out who "Gossip Girl" really is, but ultimately fails.
The season finale ended with a well-received kiss between Blair and Chuck.

Who was the critic from Entertainment Weekly that gave negative reviews?
One of the initial critics to give the show negative reviews was Ken Tucker from "Entertainment Weekly"; he called it ""The Simpsons" as conceived by a singularly sophomoric mind that lacks any reference point beyond other TV shows".
The Parents Television Council (PTC), a conservative, non-profit watchdog, has attacked the series since its premiere and has branded various episodes as "Worst TV Show of the Week".
In May 2000 the PTC launched a letter-writing campaign to the Fox network in an effort to persuade the network to cancel the show.
The PTC has placed the show on their annual lists of "Worst Prime-Time Shows for Family Viewing" in 2000, 2005, and 2006.
The Federal Communications Commission has received multiple petitions requesting that the show be blocked from broadcasting on indecency grounds.
Tucker and the PTC have both accused the show of portraying religion negatively, and of being racist.
Because of the PTC, some advertisers have canceled their contracts after reviewing the content of the episodes, claiming it to be unsuitable.
Critics have compared the show's humor and characters with those of "The Simpsons".Various episodes of the show have generated controversy.
In "The Son Also Draws" (season one, 1999) Peter jokes that "Canada sucks"; this caused controversy with Canadian viewers.
In "420" (season seven, 2009) Brian decides to start a campaign to legalize cannabis in Quahog; the Venezuelan government reacted negatively to the episode and banned "Family Guy" from airing on their local networks, which generally syndicate American programming.
Venezuelan justice minister Tareck El Aissami, citing the promotion of the use of cannabis, stated that any cable stations that did not stop airing the series would be fined; the government showed a clip which featured Brian and Stewie singing the praises of marijuana as a demonstration of how the United States supports cannabis use.
In "Extra Large Medium" (season eight, 2010) a character named Ellen (who has Down syndrome) states that her mother is the former Governor of Alaska, which strongly implies that her mother is Sarah Palin, the only woman to have served in the office of governor in the state.
Sarah Palin, the mother of a special-needs child, criticized the episode in an appearance on "The O'Reilly Factor", calling those who made the show "cruel, cold-hearted people."
When did Season 14 or South Park Premiere?
Reception.Ratings.When "South Park" debuted, it was a huge ratings success for Comedy Central and is seen as being largely responsible for the success of the channel, with Herzog crediting it for putting the network "on the map".The show's first episode, "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", earned a Nielsen rating of 1.3 (980,000 viewers), at the time considered high for a cable program.
The show instantly generated buzz among television viewers, and mass viewing parties began assembling on college campuses.
By the time the eighth episode "Starvin' Marvin" aired three months after the show debuted, ratings and viewership had tripled, and "South Park" was already the most successful show in Comedy Central's history.
When the tenth episode "Damien" aired the following February, viewership increased another 33 percent.
The episode earned a 6.4 rating, which at the time was over 10 times the average rating earned by a cable show aired in prime time.
The ratings peaked with the second episode of season two, "Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut", which aired on April 22, 1998.
The episode earned an 8.2 rating (6.2 million viewers) and, at the time, set a record as the highest-rated non-sports show in basic cable history.
During the spring of 1998, eight of the ten highest-rated shows on basic cable were "South Park" episodes.The success of "South Park" prompted more cable companies to carry Comedy Central and led it to its becoming one of the fastest-growing cable channels.
The number of households that had Comedy Central jumped from 9.1 million in 1997 to 50 million in June 1998.
When the show debuted, the most Comedy Central had earned for a 30-second commercial was US$7,500.
Within a year, advertisers were paying an average of US$40,000 for 30 seconds of advertising time during airings of "South Park" in its second season, while some paid as much as US$80,000.By the third season (1999), the series' ratings began to decrease.
The third season premiere episode drew 3.4 million viewers, a dramatic drop from the 5.5 million of the previous season's premiere.
Stone and Parker attributed this drop in the show's ratings to the media hype that surrounded the show in the previous year, adding that the third season ratings reflected the show's "true" fan base.
The show's ratings dropped further in its fourth season (2000), with episodes averaging just above 1.5 million viewers.
The ratings eventually increased, and seasons five through nine consistently averaged about 3 million viewers per episode.
Though its viewership is lower than it was at the height of its popularity in its earliest seasons, "South Park" remains one of the highest-rated series on Comedy Central.
The season 14 (2010) premiere gained 3.7 million viewers, the show's highest-rated season premiere since 1998.
Was alcohol a factor in the May 7, 1928 plane crash on Stone Mountain?
According to George Weiblen's annotated calendar for Monday, May 7, 1928: "Mail plane crashed on mountain at 8:00 P.M."Around dusk on September 16, 2003, in clear weather, a small airplane circled the mountain five times, then crashed headlong into the south side, burst into flames and killed the pilot.
A witness testifying at the NTSB investigation stated that the pilot, a 69-year-old accountant, had threatened on multiple occasions to commit suicide by flying into the mountain.
The official NTSB accident report lists the probable cause as "The pilot's intentional flight into the ground for the purpose of suicide while impaired by alcohol."
How many men fell to their death on the niagara falls walk?
Other daredevils have made crossing the gorge their goal, starting with the successful passage by Jean François "Blondin" Gravelet, who crossed Niagara Gorge in 1859.
Between 1859 and 1896 there was a wire-walking craze, and there were frequent feats over the river below the falls.
One inexperienced walker was able to slide down his safety rope.
Only one man fell to his death, at night and under mysterious circumstances, at the anchoring place for his wire.These tightrope walkers drew huge crowds to witness their exploits.
Their wires ran across the gorge, near the current Rainbow Bridge, not over the waterfall itself.
Among the many was Ontario's William Hunt, who billed himself as "The Great Farini" and competed with Blondin in performing outrageous stunts over the gorge.
On three separate occasions Blondin carried his manager, Harry Colcord, on his back—on the final time being watched by the Prince of Wales.In 1876 23-year-old Italian Maria Spelterini was the only woman ever to cross the Niagara Gorge on a tightrope, making four separate crossings over a period of 18 days.
On July 12 she crossed wearing peach baskets strapped to her feet, on July 19 blind-folded, on July 22 with her ankles and wrists manacled and finally on July 26.
Never performing again at Niagara, her personal life remains a mystery and the date and place of her death are unknown.
Tightrope crossings of the falls ended—by law—in 1896, when James Hardy crossed.On June 15, 2012, high wire artist Nik Wallenda became the first person to walk across the falls in 116 years, after receiving special permission from both governments.
The full length of his tightrope was .
Wallenda crossed near the brink of the Horseshoe Falls, unlike previous walkers who had crossed farther downstream.
According to Wallenda, it was the longest unsupported tightrope walk in history.
He carried his passport on the trip and was required to present it upon arrival on the Canadian side of the falls.
What is the Leaning Tower of Pisa called in Italy?
The Leaning Tower of Pisa () or simply the Tower of Pisa ("Torre di Pisa") is the campanile, or freestanding bell tower, of the cathedral of the Italian city of Pisa, known worldwide for its unintended tilt to one side.
It is situated behind the Cathedral and is the third oldest structure in Pisa's Cathedral Square ("Piazza del Duomo") after the Cathedral and the Baptistry.
The tower's tilt began during construction, caused by an inadequate foundation on ground too soft on one side to properly support the structure's weight.
The tilt increased in the decades before the structure was completed, and gradually increased until the structure was stabilized (and the tilt partially corrected) by efforts in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.The height of the tower is from the ground on the low side and on the high side.
The width of the walls at the base is .
Its weight is estimated at .
The tower has 296 or 294 steps; the seventh floor has two fewer steps on the north-facing staircase.
Prior to restoration work performed between 1990 and 2001, the tower leaned at an angle of 5.5 degrees, but the tower now leans at about 3.99 degrees.
This means that the top of the tower is displaced horizontally from where it would be if the structure were perfectly vertical.
How much does the Eiffel tower sway in the wind?
At the time the tower was built many people were shocked by its daring shape.
Eiffel was accused of trying to create something artistic without regard to engineering.
However, Eiffel and his engineers, as experienced bridge builders, understood the importance of wind forces and knew that if they were going to build the tallest structure in the world they had to be certain it would withstand them.
In an interview with the newspaper "Le Temps (Paris)" of 14 February 1887, Eiffel said:Eiffel used empirical and graphical methods accounting for the effects of wind rather than a specific mathematical formula.
Careful examination of the tower shows a basically exponential shape (actually two different exponentials, the lower section overdesigned to ensure resistance to wind forces.
Several mathematical explanations have been proposed over the years for the success of the design; the most recent is described as a nonlinear integral equation based on counterbalancing the wind pressure on any point on the tower with the tension between the construction elements at that point.
As proof of the tower's effectiveness in wind resistance, it sways only 6–7 cm (2–3 in) in the wind.
How much information is there on human sacrifices taking place in Machu Picchu?
There is little information on human sacrifices taking place at Machu Picchu.
This is can be attributed to the fact that many sacrifices were never given a proper burial and their skeletal remains have succumbed to the elements.
However, there is evidence that indicates the use of retainer sacrifices.
In these unique cases, human sacrifices were made to accompany a deceased noble in the afterlife.
Although human sacrifices occurred, it was much more common to offer animal, liquid and dirt sacrifices to the gods.
These offerings were made at the Altar of the Condor and are still made today by members of the New Age Andean religion.It is a belief among some New Age Andean cosmologists that aliens once inhabited the Cusco region of Peru and are responsible for building Machu Picchu's grand architecture.
These views have been widely refuted by Peruvians as they feel their ancestors were capable of such technological and architectural feats.
When did Critter Country open?
Critter Country opened in 1972 as "Bear Country", and was renamed in 1988.
Formerly the area was home to Indian Village, where indigenous tribespeople demonstrated their dances and other customs.
Today, the main draw of the area is Splash Mountain, a log-flume journey inspired by the Uncle Remus stories of Joel Chandler Harris and the animated segments of Disney's Academy Award-winning 1946 film, "Song of the South".
In 2003, a dark ride called The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh replaced the Country Bear Jamboree, which closed in 2001.
The attraction is still open in Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom.
What may cause some of the wall to disappear in the next 20 years?
While some portions north of Beijing and near tourist centers have been preserved and even extensively renovated, in many locations the Wall is in disrepair.
Those parts might serve as a village playground or a source of stones to rebuild houses and roads.
Sections of the Wall are also prone to graffiti and vandalism.
Parts have been destroyed because the Wall is in the way of construction.More than of the wall in Gansu province may disappear in the next 20 years, due to erosion from sandstorms.
In places, the height of the wall has been reduced from more than to less than .
The square lookout towers that characterize the most famous images of the wall have disappeared completely.
Many western sections of the wall are constructed from mud, rather than brick and stone, and thus are more susceptible to erosion.In August 2012, a section of the wall in north China's Hebei province collapsed after days of continuous heavy rains.
What forest lines the banks?
Mopane woodland savannah predominates in the area, with smaller areas of Miombo and Rhodesian Teak woodland and scrubland savannah.
Riverine forest with palm trees lines the banks and islands above the falls.
The most notable aspect of the area's vegetation though is the rainforest nurtured by the spray from the falls, containing plants rare for the area such as pod mahogany, ebony, ivory palm, wild date palm and a number of creepers and lianas.
Vegetation has suffered in recent droughts, and so have the animals that depend on it, particularly antelope.
When was the record high temperature in Yellowstone National Park?
Yellowstone climate is greatly influenced by altitude, with lower elevations generally found to be warmer year round.
The record high temperature was in 2002, while the coldest temperature recorded is in 1933.
During the summer months of June through early September, daytime highs are normally in the range, while nighttime lows can go to below freezing (0 °C)—especially at higher altitudes.
Summer afternoons are frequently accompanied by thunderstorms.
Spring and fall temperatures range between with cold nights in the teens to single digits (−5 to −20 °C).
Winter in Yellowstone is very cold with high temperatures usually between zero to 20 °F (−20 to −5 °C) and nighttime temperatures below zero °F (−20 °C) for most of the winter.Precipitation in Yellowstone is highly variable and ranges from annually near Mammoth Hot Springs, to in the southwestern sections of the park.
The precipitation of Yellowstone is greatly influenced by the moisture channel formed by the Snake River Plain to the west that was, in turn, formed by Yellowstone itself.
Snow is possible in any month of the year, with averages of annually around Yellowstone Lake, to twice that amount at higher elevations.Tornadoes in Yellowstone are rare; however, on July 21, 1987, the most powerful tornado recorded in Wyoming touched down in the Teton Wilderness of Bridger-Teton National Forest and hit Yellowstone National Park.
Called the Teton–Yellowstone tornado, it was classified as an F4, with wind speeds estimated at between .
The tornado left a path of destruction wide, and long, and leveled of mature pine forest.Both high elevation areas are classified as humid continental (Dfb), according to Köppen-Geiger climate classification.
Who manages Yosemite National Park?
Yosemite National Park ( ) is a United States National Park spanning eastern portions of Tuolumne, Mariposa and Madera counties in the central eastern portion of the U.S. state of California.
The park, which is managed by the National Park Service, covers an area of and reaches across the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain chain.
Over 3.7 million people visit Yosemite each year: most spend their time in the seven square miles (18 km2) of Yosemite Valley.
Designated a World Heritage Site in 1984, Yosemite is internationally recognized for its spectacular granite cliffs, waterfalls, clear streams, Giant Sequoia groves, and biological diversity.
Almost 95% of the park is designated wilderness.
Yosemite was central to the development of the national park idea.
First, Galen Clark and others lobbied to protect Yosemite Valley from development, ultimately leading to President Abraham Lincoln's signing the Yosemite Grant in 1864.
Later, John Muir led a successful movement to establish a larger national park encompassing not just the valley, but surrounding mountains and forests as well - paving the way for the United States national park system.Yosemite is one of the largest and least fragmented habitat blocks in the Sierra Nevada, and the park supports a diversity of plants and animals.
The park has an elevation range from and contains five major vegetation zones: chaparral/oak woodland, lower montane forest, upper montane forest, subalpine zone, and alpine.
Of California's 7,000 plant species, about 50% occur in the Sierra Nevada and more than 20% within Yosemite.
There is suitable habitat or documentation for more than 160 rare plants in the park, with rare local geologic formations and unique soils characterizing the restricted ranges many of these plants occupy.The geology of the Yosemite area is characterized by granitic rocks and remnants of older rock.
About 10 million years ago, the Sierra Nevada was uplifted and then tilted to form its relatively gentle western slopes and the more dramatic eastern slopes.
The uplift increased the steepness of stream and river beds, resulting in formation of deep, narrow canyons.
About 1 million years ago, snow and ice accumulated, forming glaciers at the higher alpine meadows that moved down the river valleys.
Ice thickness in Yosemite Valley may have reached during the early glacial episode.
The downslope movement of the ice masses cut and sculpted the U-shaped valley that attracts so many visitors to its scenic vistas today.
Is the Grand Canyon the deepest canyon in the world?
The Grand Canyon is a big fissure in the Colorado Plateau that exposes uplifted Proterozoic and Paleozoic strata, and is also one of the 19 distinct physiographic sections of the Colorado Plateau province.
It is not the deepest canyon in the world (Kali Gandaki Gorge in Nepal is far deeper), however, the Grand Canyon is known for its visually overwhelming size and its intricate and colorful landscape.
Geologically it is significant because of the thick sequence of ancient rocks that is beautifully preserved and exposed in the walls of the canyon.
These rock layers record much of the early geologic history of the North American continent.Uplift associated with mountain formation later moved these sediments thousands of feet upward and created the Colorado Plateau.
The higher elevation has also resulted in greater precipitation in the Colorado River drainage area, but not enough to change the Grand Canyon area from being semi-arid.
The uplift of the Colorado Plateau is uneven, and the Kaibab Plateau that Grand Canyon bisects is over a thousand feet higher at the North Rim (about ) than at the South Rim.
Almost all runoff from the North Rim (which also gets more rain and snow) flows toward the Grand Canyon, while much of the runoff on the plateau behind the South Rim flows away from the canyon (following the general tilt).
The result is deeper and longer tributary washes and canyons on the north side and shorter and steeper side canyons on the south side.Temperatures on the North Rim are generally lower than those on the South Rim because of the greater elevation (averaging 8,000 ft/2,438 m above sea level).
Heavy rains are common on both rims during the summer months.
Access to the North Rim via the primary route leading to the canyon (State Route 67) is limited during the winter season due to road closures.
Where is the Mount Rushmore National Memorial?
The Mount Rushmore National Memorial is a sculpture carved into the granite face of Mount Rushmore (Lakota Sioux name: Six Grandfathers) near Keystone, South Dakota, in the United States.
Sculpted by Danish-American Gutzon Borglum and his son, Lincoln Borglum, Mount Rushmore features sculptures of the heads of four United States presidents: George Washington (1732–1799), Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826), Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919), and Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865).
The entire memorial covers and is above sea level.South Dakota historian Doane Robinson is credited with conceiving the idea of carving the likenesses of famous people into the Black Hills region of South Dakota in order to promote tourism in the region.
Robinson's initial idea was to sculpt the Needles; however, Gutzon Borglum rejected the Needles site because of the poor quality of the granite and strong opposition from Native American groups.
They settled on the Mount Rushmore location, which also has the advantage of facing southeast for maximum sun exposure.
Robinson wanted it to feature western heroes like Lewis and Clark, Red Cloud, and Buffalo Bill Cody, but Borglum decided the sculpture should have a more national focus and chose the four presidents whose likenesses would be carved into the mountain.
After securing federal funding through the enthusiastic sponsorship of "Mount Rushmore's great political patron," U.S.
Senator Peter Norbeck, construction on the memorial began in 1927, and the presidents' faces were completed between 1934 and 1939.
Upon Gutzon Borglum's death in March 1941, his son Lincoln Borglum took over construction.
Although the initial concept called for each president to be depicted from head to waist, lack of funding forced construction to end in late October 1941.Mount Rushmore has become an iconic symbol of presidential greatness and has appeared in works of fiction, and has been discussed or depicted in other popular works.
It attracts nearly three million people annually.
Where is the Space Needle located?
The Space Needle is an observation tower in Seattle, Washington, a landmark of the Pacific Northwest, and a symbol of Seattle.
Built in the Seattle Center for the 1962 World's Fair, which drew over 2.3 million visitors, nearly 20,000 people a day used its elevators.Once the tallest structure west of the Mississippi River, it is high, wide, and weighs 9,550 tons.
It is built to withstand winds of up to and earthquakes of up to 9.1 magnitude, as strong as the 1700 Cascadia earthquake.
It also has 25 lightning rods.It has an observation deck at and a gift shop with the rotating SkyCity restaurant at .
From the top of the Needle, one can see not only the downtown Seattle skyline but also the Olympic and Cascade Mountains, Mount Rainier, Mount Baker, Elliott Bay, and surrounding islands.
Photographs of the Seattle skyline often show the Space Needle prominently, above the rest of the skyscrapers and Mount Rainier.Visitors can reach the top of the Space Needle by elevators that travel at .
The trip takes 41 seconds, and some tourists wait in hour-long lines.
On windy days, the elevators slow to .
On April 19, 1999, the city's Landmarks Preservation Board designated it a historic landmark.
When was the mounting point of the plaque changed?
There are several plaques and dedicatory tablets on or near the Statue of Liberty.
A plaque on the copper just under the figure in front declares that it is a colossal statue representing Liberty, designed by Bartholdi and built by the Paris firm of Gaget, Gauthier et Cie ("Cie" is the French abbreviation analogous to "Co.").
A presentation tablet, also bearing Bartholdi's name, declares the statue to be a gift from the people of the Republic of France that honors "the Alliance of the two Nations in achieving the Independence of the United States of America and attests their abiding friendship."
There is a tablet placed by the New York committee that commemorates the fundraising done to build the pedestal.
The cornerstone also bears a plaque placed by the Freemasons.In 1903, a bronze tablet that bears the text of "The New Colossus" and commemorates Emma Lazarus was presented by friends of the poet.
Until the 1986 renovation, it was mounted inside the pedestal; today it resides in the Statue of Liberty Museum in the base.
It is accompanied by a tablet given by the Emma Lazarus Commemorative Committee in 1977, celebrating the poet's life.A group of statues stands at the western end of the island, honoring those closely associated with the Statue of Liberty.
Two Americans—Pulitzer and Lazarus—and three Frenchmen—Bartholdi, Laboulaye, and Eiffel—are depicted.
They are the work of Maryland sculptor Phillip Ratner.In 1984, the Statue of Liberty was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The UNESCO "Statement of Significance" describes the statue as a "masterpiece of the human spirit" that "endures as a highly potent symbol—inspiring contemplation, debate and protest—of ideals such as liberty, peace, human rights, abolition of slavery, democracy and opportunity."
What is the name of Seaworld's spokesperson?
In response to criticism leveled at SeaWorld and other marine parks by the award-winning documentary film "The Cove" which accuses them of obtaining dolphins obtained in drive hunts, SeaWorld spokesperson Fred Jacobs stated that, "We think we're being unfairly criticized for something we're opposed to."
He adds that, "SeaWorld opposes the dolphin hunts documented in "The Cove".
We do not purchase any animals from these hunts.
More than 80 percent of the marine mammals in our care were born in our parks.
We haven't collected a dolphin from the wild in decades."
Since 1993 there have been no permits issued to facilities in the United States to import dolphins acquired through drive hunt methods.
Marilee Menard, the executive director of the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums, has also stated that she believes that "The Cove" filmmakers are "misrepresenting that the majority of zoos and aquariums with dolphins around the world are taking these animals."
What is the largest park area in Hershey Park?
The largest area of the park, Pioneer Frontier, the southwestern-themed section of the park, includes four of the park’s roller coasters: Trailblazer (the second oldest in the park), Sidewinder, Storm Runner, and Fahrenheit.
It also includes the Frontier Flyers, The Howler, Mini Scrambler, and Livery Stables.
It also has its own food court which features a wide variety of restaurants.
The section previously included the area up to and including Tidal Force until 2007 when Tidal Force and Canyon River Rapids were rezoned into the new Boardwalk.
When did six flags begin commercials for linking all of the parks?
In 2004, Six Flags began a series of commercials linking all of the parks.
The commercials were notable for a new mascot, "Mr. Six", an apparently feeble old man in a tuxedo and red bow tie.
In many of the commercials, Mr. Six would slowly exit a multi-colored bus, only to start frenetically dancing to the Vengaboys' "We Like to Party".
The commercials were an immediate hit and Mr. Six almost instantly became the official mascot, although he was initially retired after the 2005 season.
These ads have become widely parodied on the Internet, with faces from other Internet memes being superimposed over Mr. Six's face.From 2008 to 2010, Six Flags' TV ads have a "Fun-O-Meter" in which the beginning of the ad may show something boring or embarrassing and a man's face judges it "One Flag!"
or sometimes "Two Flags!"
Then roller coasters and attractions of Six Flags are shown and says "Six Flags, More Flags, More Fun!"
for Six Flags parks.
However, the thick accent of the Asian man in the original commercials had drawn criticism for being an offensive caricature.
In 2009, the Mr. Six character came back from retirement and replaced the Asian man in Six Flags' ads, still using the Fun-O-Meter.
Since 2011, Six Flags' TV ads got a brand-new slogan "Go Big!
Go Six Flags!"
for its current Six Flags theme parks.
When was the Stonehenge vurse built?
Before the monument (8000 BC forward).Archaeologists have found four, or possibly five, large Mesolithic postholes (one may have been a natural tree throw), which date to around 8000 BC, beneath the nearby modern tourist car-park.
These held pine posts around in diameter which were erected and eventually rotted "in situ".
Three of the posts (and possibly four) were in an east-west alignment which may have had ritual significance; no parallels are known from Britain at the time but similar sites have been found in Scandinavia.
Salisbury Plain was then still wooded but 4,000 years later, during the earlier Neolithic, people built a causewayed enclosure at Robin Hood's Ball and long barrow tombs in the surrounding landscape.
In approximately 3500 BC, a Stonehenge Cursus was built north of the site as the first farmers began to clear the trees and develop the area.
What was the LA Memorial Coliseum entrance inspired by?
The "Kongresshalle", or "Congress Hall", (1935, unfinished) at the Nazi Party Rally grounds, Nuremberg, Germany
The Summer Olympic Games medal from 1928 to 2000, designed by Giuseppe Cassioli, features a depiction of the Colosseum.
At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens the Colosseum was replaced by a depiction of the Panathinaiko Stadium
The exterior of the Vancouver Public Library resembles the current state of the Colosseum.
It was designed by Moshe Safdie.
The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum entrance was inspired by the Colosseum.
The Palazzo della Civilta Italiana was very closely modelled on the Colosseum.
It was built for Mussolini for the Universal Exhibition of 1942 but the exhibition never happened due to the outbreak of World War II.
The architects were Giovanni Guerrini, Ernesto Bruno La Padula, and Mario Romano.
How many years has the Mona Lisa survived?
The "Mona Lisa" has survived for more than 500 years, and an international commission convened in 1952 noted that "the picture is in a remarkable state of preservation."
This is partly due to the result of a variety of conservation treatments the painting has undergone.
A detailed analysis in 1933 by Madame de Gironde revealed that earlier restorers had "acted with a great deal of restraint."
Nevertheless, applications of varnish made to the painting had darkened even by the end of the 16th century, and an aggressive 1809 cleaning and revarnishing removed some of the uppermost portion of the paint layer, resulting in a washed-out appearance to the face of the figure.
Despite the treatments, the "Mona Lisa" has been well cared for throughout its history, and although the panel's warping caused the curators "some worry", the 2004–05 conservation team was optimistic about the future of the work.
Who did Van Gogh admit that he didn't have children to?
In his final letter to Theo, Van Gogh admitted that as he did not have any children, he viewed his paintings as his progeny.
Reflecting on this, the historian Simon Schama concluded that he "did have a child of course, Expressionism, and many, many heirs."
Schama mentioned many artists who have adapted elements of Van Gogh's style, including Willem de Kooning, Howard Hodgkin and Jackson Pollock.
The Fauves extended both his use of color and freedom in application, as did German Expressionists of the Die Brücke group, and as other early modernists.
Abstract Expressionism of the 1940s and 1950s is seen as in part inspired from Van Gogh's broad, gestural brush strokes.
In the words of art critic Sue Hubbard: "At the beginning of the twentieth century Van Gogh gave the Expressionists a new painterly language that enabled them to go beyond surface appearance and penetrate deeper essential truths.
It is no coincidence that at this very moment Freud was also mining the depths of that essentially modern domain – the subconscious.
This beautiful and intelligent exhibition places Van Gogh where he firmly belongs; as the trailblazer of modern art.
"In 1957, Francis Bacon (1909–1992) based a series of paintings on reproductions of Van Gogh's "The Painter on the Road to Tarascon", the original of which was destroyed during World War II.
Bacon was inspired by not only an image he described as "haunting", but also Van Gogh himself, whom Bacon regarded as an alienated outsider, a position which resonated with Bacon.
The Irish artist further identified with Van Gogh's theories of art and quoted lines written in a letter to Theo, "painters do not paint things as they are...They paint them as "they themselves" feel them to be."
An exhibition devoted to Vincent van Gogh's letters took place in the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam from October 2009 to January 2010 and then moved to the Royal Academy in London from late January to April.The Van Gogh Museum hosted an exhibition "Van Gogh at Work" featuring 200 paintings and drawings, 150 of them by van Gogh and others including Paul Gauguin and Émile Bernard; from May 1, 2013 until January 12, 2014. 
What are the origins for the word "Sphinx"?
It is not known by what name the creators called their statue, as the Great Sphinx does not appear in any known inscription of the Old Kingdom, and there are no inscriptions anywhere describing its construction or its original purpose.
In the New Kingdom, the Sphinx was called "Hor-em-akhet" (; Hellenized: "Harmachis"), and the pharaoh Thutmose IV (1401–1391 or 1397–1388 BC) specifically referred to it as such in his Dream Stele.The commonly used name "Sphinx" was given to it in classical antiquity, about 2000 years after the accepted date of its construction, by reference to a Greek mythological beast with a lion's body, a woman's head and the wings of an eagle (although, like most Egyptian sphinxes, the Great Sphinx has a man's head and no wings).
The English word "sphinx" comes from the ancient Greek Σφίγξ (transliterated: ), apparently from the verb σφίγγω (transliterated: / ), after the Greek sphinx who strangled anyone who failed to answer her riddle.The name may alternatively be a corruption of the ancient Egyptian "Ssp-anx" (in MdC), a name given to royal statues of Dynasty IV (2575–2467 BC) and later in the New Kingdom (c. 1570–1070 BC) to the Great Sphinx more specifically, although phonetically the two names are far from identical.Medieval Arab writers, including al-Maqrīzī, call the Sphinx "balhib" and "bilhaw", which suggest a Coptic influence.
The modern Egyptian Arabic name is أبو الهول (, ).
Who painted Starry Night?
Starry Night () is a painting by the Dutch post-impressionist artist Vincent van Gogh.
Painted in June 1889, it depicts the view outside of his sanitarium room window at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence (located in southern France) at night, although it was painted from memory during the day.
It has been in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, part of the Lillie P. Bliss Bequest, since 1941.
The painting is among Van Gogh's most well-known works and marks a decisive turn towards greater imaginative freedom in his art.
What year was The Scream stolen?
The Scream () is the popular name given to each of four versions of a composition, created as both paintings and pastels, by the Expressionist artist Edvard Munch between 1893 and 1910.
Der Schrei der Natur ("The Scream of Nature") is the title Munch gave to these works, all of which show a figure with an agonized expression against a landscape with a tumultuous orange sky.
Arthur Lubow has described "The Scream" as "an icon of modern art, a Mona Lisa for our time."
Edvard Munch created the four versions in various media.
The National Gallery, Oslo, holds one of two painted versions (1893, shown at right).
The Munch Museum holds the other painted version (1910, see gallery) and a pastel version from 1893.
These three versions have not traveled for years.
The fourth version (pastel, 1895) was sold for $119,922,600 at Sotheby's Impressionist and Modern Art auction on 2 May 2012 to financier Leon Black, the second highest nominal price paid for a painting at auction.
The painting was on display in the Museum of Modern Art in New York from October 2012 to April 2013.Also in 1895, Munch created a lithograph stone of the image.
Of the lithograph prints produced by Munch, several examples survive.
Only approximately four dozen prints were made before the original stone was resurfaced by the printer in Munch's absence.
"The Scream" has been the target of several high-profile art thefts.
In 1994, the version in the National Gallery was stolen.
It was recovered several months later.
In 2004, both "The Scream" and "Madonna" were stolen from the Munch Museum, and were both recovered two years later.
What were a majority of Dali's paintings inspired by?
The craggy rocks to the right represent a tip of Cap de Creus peninsula in north-eastern Catalonia.
Many of Dalí's paintings were inspired by the landscapes of his life in Catalonia.
The strange and foreboding shadow in the foreground of this painting is a reference to Mount Pani.
The Eucharist was allegedly instituted by whom?
The Eucharist, which "is recorded as celebrated by the early Christian community at Jerusalem and by St. Paul on his visit to Troas", is held to have been instituted by Christ.The institution of the Lord's Supper is recorded in the three Synoptic Gospels and in Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians.
The words of institution differ slightly in each account, reflecting a Marcan tradition (upon which Matthew is based) and a Pauline tradition (upon which Luke is based).
In addition, is a disputed text which does not appear in some of the early manuscripts of Luke.
Some scholars, therefore, believe that it is an interpolation, while others have argued that it is original.A comparison of the accounts given in the Gospels and 1 Corinthians is shown in the table below, with text from the ASV.
The disputed text from Luke 22:19b-20 is in italics.Jesus' actions in sharing the bread and wine have been linked with which refers to a blood sacrifice that, as recounted in , Moses offered in order to seal a covenant with God.
Scholars often interpret the description of Jesus' action as asking his disciples to consider themselves part of a sacrifice, where Jesus is the one due to physically undergo it.Although the Gospel of John does not include a description of the bread and wine ritual during the Last Supper, most scholars agree that (the Bread of Life Discourse) has a Eucharistic nature and resonates with the "words of institution" used in the Synoptic Gospels and the Pauline writings on the Last Supper.
What age was Wood when his father died?
Wood entered the painting in a competition at the Art Institute of Chicago.
The judges deemed it a "comic valentine", but a museum patron persuaded them to award the painting the bronze medal and $300 cash prize.
The patron also persuaded the Art Institute to buy the painting, which remains there today.
The image soon began to be reproduced in newspapers, first by the "Chicago Evening Post" and then in New York, Boston, Kansas City, and Indianapolis.
However, Wood received a backlash when the image finally appeared in the "Cedar Rapids Gazette".
Iowans were furious at their depiction as "pinched, grim-faced, puritanical Bible-thumpers".
Wood protested that he had not painted a caricature of Iowans but a depiction of his appreciation, stating "I had to go to France to appreciate Iowa."
Nan, apparently embarrassed at being depicted as the wife of someone twice her age, began telling people that the painting was of a man and his daughter, which Grant seems to confirm in his letter to a Mrs. Nellie Sudduth in 1941.Art critics who had favorable opinions about the painting, such as Gertrude Stein and Christopher Morley, also assumed the painting was meant to be a satire of rural small-town life.
It was thus seen as part of the trend toward increasingly critical depictions of rural America, along the lines of Sherwood Anderson's 1919 "Winesburg, Ohio", Sinclair Lewis's 1920 "Main Street", and Carl Van Vechten's 1924 "The Tattooed Countess" in literature.
Yet another interpretation sees it as an "old-fashioned mourning portrait... Tellingly, the curtains hanging in the windows of the house, both upstairs and down, are pulled closed in the middle of the day, a mourning custom in Victorian America.
The woman wears a black dress beneath her apron, and glances away as if holding back tears.
One imagines she is grieving for the man beside her..." Wood had been only 10 when his father had died and later had lived for a decade "above a garage reserved for hearses", so death was on his mind.However, with the onset of the Great Depression, the painting came to be seen as a depiction of steadfast American pioneer spirit.
Wood assisted this transition by renouncing his Bohemian youth in Paris and grouping himself with populist Midwestern painters, such as John Steuart Curry and Thomas Hart Benton, who revolted against the dominance of East Coast art circles.
Wood was quoted in this period as stating, "All the good ideas I've ever had came to me while I was milking a cow."
How long did Georges Seurat spend painting "A Sunday Afternoon"?
Georges Seurat spent over two years painting "A Sunday Afternoon", focusing meticulously on the landscape of the park.
He reworked the original as well as completed numerous preliminary drawings and oil sketches.
He sat in the park, creating numerous sketches of the various figures in order to perfect their form.
He concentrated on the issues of colour, light, and form.
The painting is approximately 2 by 3 meters (7 by 10 feet) in size.Motivated by study in optical and color theory, Seurat contrasted miniature dots or small brushstrokes of colors that when unified optically in the human eye were perceived as a single shade or hue.
He believed that this form of painting, called divisionism at the time but now known as pointillism, would make the colors more brilliant and powerful than standard brush strokes.
The use of dots of almost uniform size came in the second year of his work on the painting, 1885–86.
To make the experience of the painting even more vivid, he surrounded it with a frame of painted dots, which in turn he enclosed with a pure white, wooden frame, which is how the painting is exhibited today at the Art Institute of Chicago.In creating the picture, Seurat employed the then-new pigment zinc yellow (zinc chromate), most visibly for yellow highlights on the lawn in the painting, but also in mixtures with orange and blue pigments.
In the century and more since the painting's completion, the zinc yellow has darkened to brown — a colour degeneration that was already showing in the painting in Seurat's lifetime.The island of la Grande Jatte is located at the very gates of Paris, lying in the Seine between Neuilly and Levallois-Perret, a short distance from where currently stands La Défense business district.
Although for many years it was an industrial site, it is today the site of a public garden and a housing development.
When Seurat began the painting in 1884, the island was a bucolic retreat far from the urban center.The painting was first exhibited in 1886, dominating the second Salon of the Société des Artistes Indépendants, of which Seurat had been a founder in 1884.
What is the recurring theme in the Blue Period
Picasso's Blue Period (1901–1904), characterized by somber paintings rendered in shades of blue and blue-green, only occasionally warmed by other colours, began either in Spain in early 1901, or in Paris in the second half of the year.
Many paintings of gaunt mothers with children date from the Blue Period, during which Picasso divided his time between Barcelona and Paris.
In his austere use of color and sometimes doleful subject matter – prostitutes and beggars are frequent subjects – Picasso was influenced by a trip through Spain and by the suicide of his friend Carlos Casagemas.
Starting in autumn of 1901 he painted several posthumous portraits of Casagemas, culminating in the gloomy allegorical painting "La Vie" (1903), now in the Cleveland Museum of Art.The same mood pervades the well-known etching "The Frugal Repast" (1904), which depicts a blind man and a sighted woman, both emaciated, seated at a nearly bare table.
Blindness is a recurrent theme in Picasso's works of this period, also represented in "The Blindman's Meal" (1903, the Metropolitan Museum of Art) and in the portrait of "Celestina" (1903).
Other works include "Portrait of Soler" and "Portrait of Suzanne Bloch".
What year did Michealangelo complete St.Peters basilica?
Michelangelo's architectural commissions included a number that were not realised, notably the facade for Brunelleschi's Church of San Lorenzo in Florence, for which Michelangelo had a wooden model constructed, but which remains to this day unfinished rough brick.
At the same church, Giulio de' Medici (later Pope Clement VII) commissioned him to design the Medici Chapel and the tombs of Giuliano and Lorenzo Medici.
Pope Clement also commissioned the Laurentian Library, for which Michelangelo also designed the extraordinary vestibule with columns recessed into niches, and a staircase that appears to spill out of the library like a flow of lava, according to Pevsner, "...revealing Mannerism in its most sublime architectural form.
"In 1546 Michelangelo produced the highly complex ovoid design for the pavement of the Campidoglio and began designing an upper storey for the Farnese Palace.
In 1547 he took on the job of completing St Peter's Basilica, begun to a design by Bramante, and with several intermediate designs by several architects.
Michelangelo returned to Bramante's design, retaining the basic form and concepts by simplifying and strengthening the design to create a more dynamic and unified whole.
Although the late 16th-century engraving depicts the dome as having a hemispherical profile, the dome of Michelangelo's model is somewhat ovoid and the final product, as completed by Giacomo della Porta is more so.
What medium did Leonardo Da Vinci use to paint The Last Supper?
Leonardo's most famous painting of the 1490s is "The Last Supper", painted for the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria della Grazie in Milan.
The painting represents the last meal shared by Jesus with his disciples before his capture and death.
It shows specifically the moment when Jesus has just said "one of you will betray me".
Leonardo tells the story of the consternation that this statement caused to the twelve followers of Jesus.The novelist Matteo Bandello observed Leonardo at work and wrote that some days he would paint from dawn till dusk without stopping to eat and then not paint for three or four days at a time.
This was beyond the comprehension of the prior of the convent, who hounded him until Leonardo asked Ludovico to intervene.
Vasari describes how Leonardo, troubled over his ability to adequately depict the faces of Christ and the traitor Judas, told the Duke that he might be obliged to use the prior as his model.When finished, the painting was acclaimed as a masterpiece of design and characterisation, but it deteriorated rapidly, so that within a hundred years it was described by one viewer as "completely ruined".
Leonardo, instead of using the reliable technique of fresco, had used tempera over a ground that was mainly gesso, resulting in a surface which was subject to mold and to flaking.
Despite this, the painting has remained one of the most reproduced works of art, countless copies being made in every medium from carpets to cameos.
When was Donatello called to Padua?
In 1443, Donatello was called to Padua by the heirs of the famous condottiero Erasmo da Narni, who had died that year.
Completed in 1450 and placed in the square facing the Basilica of St. Anthony, his equestrian statue of Erasmo (better known as the "Gattamelata", or "Honey-Cat") was the first example of such a monument since ancient times.
(Other equestrian statues, from the 14th century, had not been executed in bronze and had been placed over tombs rather than erected independently, in a public place.)
This work became the prototype for other equestrian monuments executed in Italy and Europe in the following centuries.For the Basilica of St. Anthony, Donatello created, most famously, the bronze Crucifix of 1444–1447 and additional statues for the choir, including a "Madonna with Child" and six saints, constituting a Holy Conversation, which is no longer visible since the renovation by Camillo Boito in 1895.
The "Madonna with Child" portrays the Child being displayed to the faithful, on a throne flanked by two sphinxes, allegorical figures of knowledge.
On the throne's back is a relief of Adam and Eve.
During this period—1446–50—Donatello also executed four extremely important reliefs with scenes from the life of St. Anthony for the high altar.
When was the Thinker originally begun?
Originally named "The Poet" (""), the "Thinker" was initially a figure in a large commission, begun in 1880, for a doorway surround called "The Gates of Hell".
Rodin based this on "The Divine Comedy" of Dante, and most of the many figures in the work represented the main characters in the epic poem.
Some critics believe "The Thinker", at the centre of the composition over the doorway and at about 70 cm high larger than most other figures, was originally intended to depict Dante at the Gates of Hell, pondering his great poem.
However, there are questionable aspects to this interpretation, including that the figure is naked, Dante is fully clothed throughout his poem, and that the figure, as used, in no way corresponds to Dante's effete figure.
The sculpture is nude, as Rodin wanted a heroic figure in the tradition of Michelangelo, to represent intellect as well as poetry.This detail from the "Gates of Hell" was first named "The Thinker" by foundry workers, who noted its similarity to Michelangelo's statue of Lorenzo de Medici called """" (The Thinker).
Rodin decided to treat the figure as an independent work, at a larger size.
The figure was designed to be seen from below, and is normally displayed on a fairly high plinth, though the heights chosen by the various owners for these vary considerably.
How much did the "Reclining Figure: Festival" sell for?
By the end of his career, Moore was the world's most successful living artist at auction.
In 1982, four years before his death, Sotheby's in New York sold a 6 ft "Reclining Figure" (1945), for $1.2 million to collector Wendell Cherry.
Although a first record of $4.1 million was set in 1990, Moore's market slumped during the recession that followed.
His eight-foot bronze, "Reclining Figure: Festival" (1951) sold for a record £19.1 million at Christie's, making him the second most expensive 20th-century British artist after Francis Bacon.
What is the mission of the Andy Warhol foundation?
Warhol's will dictated that his entire estate — with the exception of a few modest legacies to family members — would go to create a foundation dedicated to the "advancement of the visual arts".
Warhol had so many possessions that it took Sotheby's nine days to auction his estate after his death; the auction grossed more than US$20 million.In 1987, in accordance with Warhol's will, the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts began.
The foundation serves as the estate of Andy Warhol, but also has a mission "to foster innovative artistic expression and the creative process" and is "focused primarily on supporting work of a challenging and often experimental nature.
"The Artists Rights Society is the U.S. copyright representative for the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts for all Warhol works with the exception of Warhol film stills.
The U.S. copyright representative for Warhol film stills is the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh.
Additionally, the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts has agreements in place for its image archive.
All digital images of Warhol are exclusively managed by Corbis, while all transparency images of Warhol are managed by Art Resource.The Andy Warhol Foundation released its "20th Anniversary Annual Report" as a three-volume set in 2007: Vol.
I, 1987–2007; Vol.
II, Grants & Exhibitions; and Vol.
III, Legacy Program.
The Foundation remains one of the largest grant-giving organizations for the visual arts in the U.S.
When were a large number of fake Salvador Dali paintings produced?
The artist worked extensively in the graphic arts, producing many etchings and lithographs.
While his early work in printmaking is equal in quality to his important paintings, as he grew older he would sell the rights to images but not be involved in the print production itself.
In addition, a large number of fakes were produced in the 1980s and 1990s, thus further confusing the Dalí print market.
How much is this painting insured for?
In 1960, Ornette Coleman's album "" featured a Pollock painting as its cover artwork.The British indie band The Stone Roses were heavily influenced by Pollock; they have cover artwork made of pastiches of his work.In the early 1990s, three groups of movie makers were developing Pollock biographical projects, each based on a different source.
The project that at first seemed most advanced was a joint venture between Barbra Streisand's Barwood Films and Robert De Niro's TriBeCa Productions (De Niro's parents were friends of Krasner and Pollock).
The script, by Christopher Cleveland, was to be based on Jeffrey Potter's 1985 oral biography, "To a Violent Grave," a collection of reminiscences by Pollock's friends.
Streisand was to play the role of Lee Krasner, and De Niro was to portray Pollock.A second was to be based on "Love Affair" (1974), a memoir by Ruth Kligman, who was Pollock's lover in the six months before his death.
This was to be directed by Harold Becker, with Al Pacino playing Pollock.In 2000, the biographical film "Pollock", based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, "Jackson Pollock: An American Saga", was released.
Marcia Gay Harden won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Lee Krasner.
The movie was the project of Ed Harris, who portrayed Pollock and directed it.
He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.
The Pollock-Krasner Foundation did not authorize or collaborate with any production.In September 2009, the art historian Henry Adams claimed in "Smithsonian Magazine" that Pollock had written his name in his famous painting "Mural" (1943).
The painting is now insured for $140 million.
In 2011, the Republican Iowa State Representative Scott Raecker introduced a bill to force the sale of the artwork, held by The University of Iowa, in order to fund scholarships, but his bill created such controversy that it was quickly withdrawn.
Where was Matisse born?
Matisse was born in Le Cateau-Cambrésis, in the Nord department in northern France, the oldest son of a prosperous grain merchant.
He grew up in Bohain-en-Vermandois, Picardie, France.
In 1887 he went to Paris to study law, working as a court administrator in Le Cateau-Cambrésis after gaining his qualification.
He first started to paint in 1889, after his mother brought him art supplies during a period of convalescence following an attack of appendicitis.
He discovered "a kind of paradise" as he later described it, and decided to become an artist, deeply disappointing his father.
In 1891, he returned to Paris to study art at the Académie Julian and became a student of William-Adolphe Bouguereau and Gustave Moreau.
Initially he painted still-lifes and landscapes in a traditional style, at which he achieved reasonable proficiency.
Matisse was influenced by the works of earlier masters such as Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin, Nicolas Poussin, and Antoine Watteau, as well as by modern artists such as Édouard Manet, and by Japanese art.
Chardin was one of the painters Matisse most admired; as an art student he made copies of four of Chardin's paintings in the Louvre.In 1896 and 1897, Matisse visited the Australian painter John Peter Russell on the island Belle Île off the coast of Brittany.
Russell introduced him to Impressionism and to the work of van Gogh, who had been a friend of Russell but was completely unknown at the time.
Matisse's style changed completely, and he would later say "Russell was my teacher, and Russell explained colour theory to me."
In 1896 Matisse exhibited five paintings in the salon of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, two of which were purchased by the state.With the model Caroline Joblau, he had a daughter, Marguerite, born in 1894.
In 1898 he married Amélie Noellie Parayre; the two raised Marguerite together and had two sons, Jean (born 1899) and Pierre (born 1900).
Marguerite and Amélie often served as models for Matisse.In 1898, on the advice of Camille Pissarro, he went to London to study the paintings of J. M. W. Turner and then went on a trip to Corsica.
Upon his return to Paris in February 1899, he worked beside Albert Marquet and met André Derain, Jean Puy, and Jules Flandrin.
Matisse immersed himself in the work of others and went into debt from buying work from painters he admired.
The work he hung and displayed in his home included a plaster bust by Rodin, a painting by Gauguin, a drawing by van Gogh, and Cézanne's "Three Bathers".
In Cézanne's sense of pictorial structure and colour, Matisse found his main inspiration.Many of Matisse's paintings from 1898 to 1901 make use of a Divisionist technique he adopted after reading Paul Signac's essay, "D'Eugène Delacroix au Néo-impressionisme".
His paintings of 1902–03, a period of material hardship for the artist, are comparatively somber and reveal a preoccupation with form.
Having made his first attempt at sculpture, a copy after Antoine-Louis Barye, in 1899, he devoted much of his energy to working in clay, completing "The Slave" in 1903.
How many players are on each team?
Each team consists of a maximum of eleven players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper.
Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team, which is usually seven.
Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the penalty area in front of their own goal.
Though there are a variety of positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws.The basic equipment or "kit" players are required to wear includes a shirt, shorts, socks, footwear and adequate shin guards.
An athletic supporter and protective cup is highly recommended for male players by medical experts and professionals.
Headgear is not a required piece of basic equipment, but players today may choose to wear it to protect themselves from head injury.
Players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player, such as jewellery or watches.
The goalkeeper must wear clothing that is easily distinguishable from that worn by the other players and the match officials.A number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game.
The maximum number of substitutions permitted in most competitive international and domestic league games is three, though the permitted number may vary in other competitions or in friendly matches.
Common reasons for a substitution include injury, tiredness, ineffectiveness, a tactical switch, or timewasting at the end of a finely poised game.
In standard adult matches, a player who has been substituted may not take further part in a match.
IFAB recommends that "that a match should not continue if there are fewer than seven players in either team."
Any decision regarding points awarded for abandoned games is left to the individual football associations.A game is officiated by a referee, who has "full authority to enforce the Laws of the Game in connection with the match to which he has been appointed" (Law 5), and whose decisions are final.
The referee is assisted by two assistant referees.
In many high-level games there is also a fourth official who assists the referee and may replace another official should the need arise.

What does the manager do?
The manager, or head coach of a team, oversees the team's major strategic decisions, such as establishing the starting rotation, setting the lineup, or batting order, before each game, and making substitutions during games—in particular, bringing in relief pitchers.
Managers are typically assisted by two or more coaches; they may have specialized responsibilities, such as working with players on hitting, fielding, pitching, or strength and conditioning.
At most levels of organized play, two coaches are stationed on the field when the team is at bat: the first base coach and third base coach, occupying designated coaches' boxes just outside the foul lines, assist in the direction of baserunners when the ball is in play, and relay tactical signals from the manager to batters and runners during pauses in play.
In contrast to many other team sports, baseball managers and coaches generally wear their team's uniforms; coaches must be in uniform in order to be allowed on the playing field during a game.Any baseball game involves one or more umpires, who make rulings on the outcome of each play.
At a minimum, one umpire will stand behind the catcher, to have a good view of the strike zone, and call balls and strikes.
Additional umpires may be stationed near the other bases, thus making it easier to judge plays such as attempted force outs and tag outs.
In Major League Baseball, four umpires are used for each game, one near each base.
In the playoffs, six umpires are used: one at each base and two in the outfield along the foul lines.
What gives the opposing team a free throw?
Basketball is a sport played by two teams of five players on a rectangular court.
The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop in diameter and high mounted to a backboard at each end.
Basketball is one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports.A team can score a field goal by shooting the ball through the basket during regular play.
A field goal scores two points for the shooting team if a player is touching or closer to the basket than the three-point line, and three points (known commonly as a "3 pointer" or "three") if the player is behind the three-point line.
The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but additional time (overtime) may be issued when the game ends with a draw.
The ball can be advanced on the court by bouncing it while walking or running or throwing it to a team mate.
It is a violation to move without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.Violations are called "fouls".
A personal foul is penalized, and a free throw is usually awarded to an offensive player if he is fouled while shooting the ball.
A technical foul may also be issued when certain infractions occur, most commonly for unsportsmanlike conduct on the part of a player or coach.
A technical foul gives the opposing team a free throw, and the opposing team also retains possession of the ball.As well as many techniques for shooting, passing, dribbling and rebounding, basketball has specialized player positions and offensive and defensive structures (player positioning).
Typically, the tallest members of a team will play "center", "power forward" or "small forward" positions, while shorter players or those who possess the best ball handling skills and speed play "point guard" or "shooting guard".
What are winning break points referred to as?
Game pointA "game point" occurs in tennis whenever the player who is in the lead in the game needs only one more point to win the game.
The terminology is extended to sets (set point), matches (match point), and even championships (championship point).
For example, if the player who is serving has a score of 40-love, the player has a triple game point (triple set point, etc.)
as the player has three consecutive chances to win the game.
Game points, set points, and match points are not part of official scoring and are not announced by the chair umpire in tournament play.Break pointA "break point" occurs if the receiver, not the server, has a chance to win the game with the next point.
Break points are of particular importance because serving is generally considered advantageous, with the server being expected to win games in which they are serving.
A receiver who has one (score of 30–40), two (score of 15–40) or three (score of love-40) consecutive chances to win the game has "break point", "double break point" or "triple break point", respectively.
If the receiver does, in fact, win their break point, the game is awarded to the receiver, and the receiver is said to have "converted" their break point.
If the receiver fails to win their break point it is called a "failure to convert."
Winning break points, and thus the game, is also referred to as "breaking serve", as the receiver has disrupted, or "broken" the natural advantage of the server.
If in the following game the previous server also wins a break point it is referred to as "breaking back".
At least one break of serve is required to win a set.
Who does Miliatry swimming?
Some occupations require the workers to swim.
For example, abalone- or pearl-divers swim and dive to obtain an economic benefit, as do spear fishermen.Swimming is used to rescue people in the water who may be in distress, including tired swimmers, non-swimmers who have accidentally entered the water, or water users who have come to harm.
Lifeguards or volunteer lifesavers are deployed at many pools and beaches worldwide to fulfill this purpose, and they, as well as rescue swimmers, may use specific swimming styles for rescue purposes.Swimming is also used in marine biology to observe plants and animals in their natural habitat.
Other sciences use swimming, for example Konrad Lorenz swam with geese as part of his studies of animal behavior.Swimming also has military purposes.
Military swimming is usually done by special forces, such as Navy SEALs.
Swimming is used to approach a location, gather intelligence, sabotage or combat, and to depart a location.
This may also include airborne insertion into water or exiting a submarine while it is submerged.
Due to regular exposure to large bodies of water, all recruits in the United States Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard are required to complete basic swimming or water survival training.Swimming is also a professional sport.
Companies sponsor swimmers who are at the international level.
Many swimmers compete competitively in order to represent their home country in the olympics.
Cash awards are also given at many of the major competitions for breaking records.Professional swimmers may also earn a living as entertainers, performing in water ballets.
What is a reception also called?
Also called reception, the pass is the attempt by a team to properly handle the opponent's serve, or any form of attack.
Proper handling includes not only preventing the ball from touching the court, but also making it reach the position where the setter is standing quickly and precisely.The skill of passing involves fundamentally two specific techniques: underarm pass, or bump, where the ball touches the inside part of the joined forearms or platform, at waist line; and overhand pass, where it is handled with the fingertips, like a set, above the head.
Either are acceptable in professional and beach volleyball, however there are much tighter regulations on the overhand pass in beach volleyball.
What are the physical attributes to Irons
Golf clubs are used to hit the golf ball.
Each club is composed of a shaft with a lance (or "grip") on the top end and a club head on the bottom.
Long clubs, which have a lower amount of degreed loft, are those meant to propel the ball a comparatively longer distance, and short clubs a higher degree of loft and a comparatively shorter distance.
Typically, the actual physical length of each club is longer or shorter, depending on the distance the club is intended to propel the ball.Golf clubs have traditionally been arranged into three basic types.
Woods are large-headed, long-shafted clubs meant to propel the ball a long distance from relatively "open" lies, such as the tee box and fairway.
Of particular importance is the "driver" or "1-wood", which is the lowest lofted wood club, and in modern times has become highly specialized for making extremely long-distance tee shots, up to or more in the hands of a professional golfer.
Traditionally these clubs had heads made of a hardwood, hence the name, but virtually all modern woods are now made of metal such as titanium, or of composite materials.
Irons are shorter-shafted clubs with a metal head primarily consisting of a flat, angled striking face.
Traditionally the clubhead was forged from iron; modern iron clubheads are investment-cast from a steel alloy.
Irons of varying loft are used for a variety of shots from virtually anywhere on the course, but most often for shorter-distance shots approaching the green, or to get the ball out of tricky lies such as sand traps.
The third class is the putter, which evolved from the irons to create a low-lofted, balanced club designed to roll the ball along the green and into the hole.
Putters are virtually always used on the green or in the surrounding rough/fringe.
A fourth class, called hybrids, evolved as a cross between woods and irons, and are typically seen replacing the low-lofted irons with a club that provides similar distance, but a higher launch angle and a more forgiving nature.A maximum of 14 clubs is allowed in a player's bag at one time during a stipulated round.
The choice of clubs is at the golfer's discretion, although every club must be constructed in accordance with parameters outlined in the rules.
(Clubs that meet these parameters are usually called "conforming".)
Violation of these rules can result in disqualification.The exact shot hit at any given time on a golf course, and which club is used to accomplish the shot, are always completely at the discretion of the golfer; in other words, there is no restriction whatsoever on which club a golfer may or may not use at any time for any shot.Golf balls are spherical, usually white (although other colors are allowed), and minutely pock-marked by dimples that decrease aerodynamic drag by increasing air turbulence around the ball in motion, which delays "boundary layer" separation and reduces the drag-inducing "wake" behind the ball,thereby allowing the ball to fly farther.A tee is allowed only for the first stroke on each hole, unless the player must hit a provisional tee shot or replay his or her first shot from the tee.Many golfers wear golf shoes with metal or plastic spikes designed to increase traction, thus allowing for longer and more accurate shots.
A golf bag is used to transport golf clubs and the player's other or personal equipment.
Golf bags have several pockets designed for carrying equipment and supplies such as tees, balls, and gloves.
Golf bags can be carried, pulled on a trolley or harnessed to a motorized golf cart during play.
Golf bags have both a hand strap and shoulder strap for carrying, and sometimes have retractable legs that allow the bag to stand upright when at rest.
Is the singles or doubles court more narrow?
The singles court is narrower than the doubles court, but the same length.
Since one person needs to cover the entire court, singles tactics are based on forcing the opponent to move as much as possible; this means that singles strokes are normally directed to the corners of the court.
Players exploit the length of the court by combining lifts and clears with drop shots and net shots.
Smashing tends to be less prominent in singles than in doubles because the smasher has no partner to follow up his effort and is thus vulnerable to a skillfully placed return.
Moreover, frequent smashing can be exhausting in singles where the conservation of a player's energy is at a premium.
However, players with strong smashes will sometimes use the shot to create openings, and players commonly smash weak returns to try to end rallies.In singles, players will often start the rally with a forehand high serve or with a flick serve.
Low serves are also used frequently, either forehand or backhand.
Drive serves are rare.At high levels of play, singles demands extraordinary fitness.
Singles is a game of patient positional manoeuvring, unlike the all-out aggression of doubles.
When was "The Crash Reel" premiered?
Media.Films.Snowboarding films have become a main part of progression in the sport.
Each season, many films are released, usually in Autumn.
These are made by many snowboard specific video production companies as well as manufacturing companies that use these films as a form of advertisement.
Snowboarding videos usually contain video footage of professional riders sponsored by companies.
An example of commercial use of snowboarding films would be "The White Album", a film by snowboarding legend and filmmaker Dave Seoane about Shaun White, that includes cameos by Tony Hawk and was sponsored by PlayStation, Mountain Dew and Burton Snowboards.
Snowboarding films are also used as documentation of snowboarding and showcasing of current trends and styles of the sport.However, sometimes the snowboarding industry is not supportive of all snowboarding-themed films.
In 2013, "The Crash Reel", a feature-length documentary by filmmaker Lucy Walker about former Shaun White rival Kevin Pearce, premiered on the film festival circuit to critical acclaim and was subsequently broadcast on HBO.
Using Pearce's career-ending traumatic brain injury and subsequent recovery as a backdrop, the film examines the physical dangers inherent to pro snowboarders and other extreme sports professional athletes under pressure by sponsors and the media to perform increasingly spectacular feats.
Although there are significant references to various brands in the film, Walker is "adamant" that the snowboarding industry did not sponsor the film in any way and in fact has been unsupportive, despite the film's mainstream media success.
In what century were the mechanicas of modern fencing originated?
The ancestor of modern fencing originated in Spain, where several books on fencing were written.
"Treatise on Arms" was written by Diego de Valera between 1458 and 1471 and is one of the oldest surviving manuals on western fencing shortly before dueling came under official ban by the Catholic Monarchs.
In conquest, the Spanish forces carried fencing around the world, particularly southern Italy, one of the major areas of strife between both nations.The mechanics of modern fencing originated in the 18th century in an Italian school of fencing of the Renaissance, and, under their influence, was improved by the French school of fencing.
The Spanish school of fencing stagnated and was replaced by the Italian and French schools.
Nowadays, these two schools are the most influential around the world.Dueling went into sharp decline after World War I.
After World War II, dueling went out of use in Europe except for very rare exceptions.
Training for duels, once fashionable for males of aristocratic backgrounds (although fencing masters such as Hope suggest that many people considered themselves trained from taking only one or two lessons), all but disappeared, along with the classes themselves.
Fencing continued as a sport, with tournaments and championships.
However, the need to actually prepare for a duel with "sharps" vanished, changing both training and technique.Starting with épée in 1936, side-judges were replaced by an electrical scoring apparatus, with an audible tone and a red or green light indicating when a touch landed.
Foil first embraced electronic scoring in 1956, sabre in 1988.
The scoring box reduced the bias in judging, and permitted more accurate scoring of faster actions, lighter touches, and more touches to the back and flank than before.
What is a release aid?
A release aid is a mechanical device designed to give a crisp and precise loose of arrows from a compound bow.
In the most commonly used, the string is released by a finger-operated trigger mechanism, held in the archer's hand or attached to their wrist.
In another type, known as a back-tension release, the string is automatically released when drawn to a pre-determined tension.
What martial art originated in Russia in the 20th century?
Sambo is a martial art that originated in the Soviet Union (specifically Russia) in the 20th century.
It is an acronym for "self-defence without weapons" in Russian and had its origins in the Soviet armed forces.
Its influences are varied, with techniques borrowed from sports ranging from the two international wrestling styles of Greco-Roman and freestyle to judo, jujitsu, European styles of folk wrestling, and even fencing.
The rules for sport sambo are similar to those in competitive judo, with a variety of leg locks and defense holds from the various national wrestling styles in the Soviet Union, while not allowing chokeholds.
In what country was boxing banned until 2007?
Knocking a person unconscious or even causing concussion may cause permanent brain damage.
There is no clear division between the force required to knock a person out and the force likely to kill a person.
Since 1980, more than 200 amateur boxers, professional boxers and Toughman fighters have died due to ring or training injuries.
In 1983, the "Journal of the American Medical Association" called for a ban on boxing.
The editor, Dr. George Lundberg, called boxing an "obscenity" that "should not be sanctioned by any civilized society."
Since then, the British, Canadian and Australian Medical Associations also have called for bans on boxing.Supporters of the ban state that boxing is the only sport where hurting the other athlete is the goal.
Dr. Bill O'Neill, boxing spokesman for the British Medical Association, has supported the BMA's proposed ban on boxing: "It is the only sport where the intention is to inflict serious injury on your opponent, and we feel that we must have a total ban on boxing."
Opponents respond that such a position is misguided opinion, stating that amateur boxing is scored solely according to total connecting blows with no award for "injury".
They observe that many skilled professional boxers have had rewarding careers without inflicting injury on opponents by accumulating scoring blows and avoiding punches winning rounds scored 10-9 by the 10-point must system, and they note that there are many other sports where concussions are much more prevalent.
In 2007, one study of amateur boxers showed that protective headgear did not prevent brain damage, and another found that amateur boxers faced a high risk of brain damage.
The Gothenburg study analyzed temporary levels of neurofiliment light in cerebral spinal fluid which they conclude is evidence of damage, even though the levels soon subside.
More comprehensive studies of neurologiocal function on larger samples performed by Johns Hopkins University and accident rates analyzed by National Safety Council show amateur boxing is a comparatively safe sport.In 1997, the American Association of Professional Ringside Physicians was established to create medical protocols through research and education to prevent injuries in boxing.Professional boxing is forbidden in Norway, Iceland, Iran and North Korea.
It was banned in Sweden until 2007 when the ban was lifted but strict restrictions, including four three-minute rounds for fights, were imposed.
It was banned in Albania from 1965 till the fall of Communism in 1991; it is now legal.
Who wrote "On the Glory of Athens"?
History.Origin.The name "Marathon" comes from the legend of Pheidippides, a Greek messenger.
The legend states that he was sent from the battlefield of Marathon to Athens to announce that the Persians had been defeated in the Battle of Marathon (in which he had just fought), which took place in August or September, 490 BC.
It is said that he ran the entire distance without stopping and burst into the assembly, exclaiming ("nenikekamen", "we have wοn"), before collapsing and dying.
The account of the run from Marathon to Athens first appears in Plutarch's "On the Glory of Athens" in the 1st century AD which quotes from Heraclides Ponticus's lost work, giving the runner's name as either Thersipus of Erchius or Eucles.
Lucian of Samosata (2nd century AD) also gives the story but names the runner Philippides (not Pheidippides).There is debate about the historical accuracy of this legend.
The Greek historian Herodotus, the main source for the Greco-Persian Wars, mentions Pheidippides as the messenger who ran from Athens to Sparta asking for help, and then ran back, a distance of over each way.
In some Herodotus manuscripts the name of the runner between Athens and Sparta is given as Philippides.
Herodotus makes no mention of a messenger sent from Marathon to Athens, and relates that the main part of the Athenian army, having fought and won the grueling battle, and fearing a naval raid by the Persian fleet against an undefended Athens, marched quickly back from the battle to Athens, arriving the same day.In 1879, Robert Browning wrote the poem .
Browning's poem, his composite story, became part of late 19th century popular culture and was accepted as a historic legend.Mount Penteli stands between Marathon and Athens, which means that, if Pheidippides actually made his famous run after the battle, he had to run around the mountain, either to the north or to the south.
The latter and more obvious route matches almost exactly the modern Marathon-Athens highway, which follows the lie of the land southwards from Marathon Bay and along the coast, then takes a gentle but protracted climb westwards towards the eastern approach to Athens, between the foothills of Mounts Hymettus and Penteli, and then gently downhill to Athens proper.
This route, as it existed when the Olympics were revived in 1896, was approximately long, and this was the approximate distance originally used for marathon races.
However there have been suggestions that Pheidippides might have followed another route: a westward climb along the eastern and northern slopes of Mount Penteli to the pass of Dionysos, and then a straight southward downhill path to Athens.
This route is considerably shorter, some , but includes a very steep initial climb of more than .
Which language is most often used in taekwondo?
In taekwondo, Korean language commands are often used.
Korean numerals may be used as prompts or commands, or for counting repetition exercises.
Often, students count in Korean during their class, and during tests they are usually asked what certain Korean words mean.
These words are fairly common amongst taekwondo schools, but accuracy of pronunciation can vary widely.
When did the United Kingdom ban the shooting of pigeons?
Shooting is used for hunting upland game birds such as grouse or pheasant, rabbits, culling, deer hunting, or other wild game animals, or shooting pest animals.
Clay pigeon shooting is meant to simulate shooting live pigeons released from traps, after doing so was banned in the United Kingdom in 1921.
Sometimes "shooting" refers to the hunting activity itself.Shooting is also used in warfare, self-defense, crime, and law enforcement.
Duels were sometimes held using guns.
Shooting without a target has applications such as celebratory gunfire, 21-gun salute, or firing starting pistols, incapable of releasing bullets.
When was the school founded?
In February 1882, Kano founded a school and dojo at the , a Buddhist temple in what was then the Shitaya ward of Tokyo (now the Higashi Ueno district of Taitō ward).
Iikubo, Kano's "Kitō-ryū" instructor, attended the dojo three days a week to help teach and, although two years would pass before the temple would be called by the name , and Kano had not yet received his in "Kitō-ryū", this is now regarded as the Kodokan founding.The "Eisho-ji" dojo was a relatively small affair, consisting of a twelve mat training area.
Kano took in resident and non-resident students, the first two being Tsunejiro Tomita and Shiro Saigo.
In August, the following year, the pair were granted grades, the first that had been awarded in any martial art.
Is the flick a single stroke?
When a player tries to attack a ball that has not bounced beyond the edge of the table, the player does not have the room to wind up in a "backswing".
The ball "may still be attacked", however, and the resulting shot is called a flick because the backswing is compressed into a quick wrist action.
A flick is not a single stroke and can resemble either a drive or a loop in its characteristics.
What identifies the stroke is the backswing is compressed into a short wrist flick.
The US has what percent of global coal reserves?
The United States energy market is 29,000 terawatt hours per year.
Energy consumption per capita is 7.8 tons of oil equivalent per year, the 10th highest rate in the world.
In 2005, 40% of this energy came from petroleum, 23% from coal, and 22% from natural gas.
The remainder was supplied by nuclear power and renewable energy sources.
The United States is the world's largest consumer of petroleum.For decades, nuclear power has played a limited role relative to many other developed countries, in part because of public perception in the wake of a 1979 accident.
In 2007, several applications for new nuclear plants were filed.
The United States has 27% of global coal reserves.
It is the world's largest producer of natural gas and crude oil.
What country does China claim
In addition to claiming all of Taiwan, China has been involved in a number of other international territorial disputes.
Since the 1990s, China has been involved in negotiations to resolve its disputed land borders, including a disputed border with India and an undefined border with Bhutan.
China is additionally involved in multilateral disputes over the ownership of several small islands in the East and South China Seas, such as the Senkaku Islands and the Scarborough Shoal.
What allowed for less population loss in Russia during plagues compared to other nations?
The most powerful successor state to Kievan Rus' was the Grand Duchy of Moscow ("Moscovy" in the Western chronicles), initially a part of Vladimir-Suzdal.
While still under the domain of the Mongol-Tatars and with their connivance, Moscow began to assert its influence in the Central Rus' in the early 14th century, gradually becoming the main leading force in the process of the Rus' lands' reunification and expansion of Russia.Those were hard times, with frequent Mongol-Tatar raids and agriculture suffering from the beginning of the Little Ice Age.
As in the rest of Europe, plagues hit Russia somewhere once every five or six years from 1350 to 1490.
However, because of the lower population density and better hygiene (widespread practicing of banya, the wet steam bath), the population loss caused by plagues was not so severe as in the Western Europe, and the pre-Plague populations were reached in Russia as early as 1500.Led by Prince Dmitry Donskoy of Moscow and helped by the Russian Orthodox Church, the united army of Russian principalities inflicted a milestone defeat on the Mongol-Tatars in the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380.
Moscow gradually absorbed the surrounding principalities, including the formerly strong rivals, such as Tver and Novgorod.Ivan III ("the Great") finally threw off the control of the Golden Horde, consolidated the whole of Central and Northern Rus' under Moscow's dominion, and was the first to take the title "Grand Duke of all the Russias".
After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Moscow claimed succession to the legacy of the Eastern Roman Empire.
Ivan III married Sophia Palaiologina, the niece of the last Byzantine emperor Constantine XI, and made the Byzantine double-headed eagle his own, and eventually Russian, coat-of-arms.
which cities urban area is largest in england?
The Greater London Urban Area is by far the largest urban area in England and one of the busiest cities in the world.
It is considered a global city and has a population larger than other countries in the United Kingdom besides England itself.
Other urban areas of considerable size and influence tend to be in northern England or the English Midlands.
There are fifty settlements which have been designated city status in England, while the wider United Kingdom has sixty-six.While many cities in England are quite large in size, such as Birmingham, Sheffield, Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Newcastle, Bradford, Nottingham and others, a large population is not necessarily a prerequisite for a settlement to be afforded city status.
Traditionally the status was afforded to towns with diocesan cathedrals and so there are smaller cities like Wells, Ely, Ripon, Truro and Chichester.
According to the Office for National Statistics the ten largest, continuous built-up urban areas are:
What was the population on France in 2013, and how much does it grow per year?
With an estimated population of 66 million people as of July 2013, France is the 21st-most populous country in the world and the third-most populous in Europe.
Although the French people are historically of Celtic, Romantic, and Germanic origin, they are today a mixture of several ethnic groups, due mostly to large-scale immigration over the last century.In 2004, the Institut Montaigne estimated that within Metropolitan France, 51 million people were white (85% of the population), 6 million were North African (10%), 2 million were black (3.5%), and 1 million were Asian (1.5%).A law originating from the 1789 revolution and reaffirmed in the 1958 French Constitution makes it illegal for the French state to collect data on ethnicity and ancestry, although some surveys, such as the TeO ("Trajectories and origins") poll conducted jointly by INED and INSEE in 2008, are allowed to do so.
It was estimated that 5 million people were of Italian ancestry (the most numerous immigrant community), between 3 million and 6 million people are of North African ancestry, 2.5 million people are of Sub-Saharan African origin, 200,000 people are of Turkish ancestry, and many more are of other European ethnic ancestry, namely Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, and Greek.Indeed, it is currently estimated that 40% of the French population is descended at least partially from the different waves of immigration the country has received since the early 20th century; between 1921 and 1935 alone, about 1.1 million net immigrants came to France.
The next largest waves came in the 1960s, when around 1.6 million "pieds noirs" returned to France following the independence of its North African possessions.France remains a major destination for immigrants, accepting about 200,000 legal immigrants annually.
It is also Western Europe's leading recipient of asylum seekers, with an estimated 50,000 applications in 2005 (a 15% decrease from 2004).
The European Union allows free movement between the member states, although France established controls to curb Eastern European migration, and immigration remains a contentious political issue.In 2008, the French national institute of statistics INSEE estimated that the total number of foreign-born immigrants was around 5 million (8% of the population), while their French-born descendants numbered 6.5 million, or 11% of the population.
Thus, nearly a fifth of the country's population were either first or second-generation immigrants, more than 5 million of European origin and 4 million of Maghrebi origin.
In 2008, France granted citizenship to 137,000 persons, mostly to people from Morocco, Algeria and Turkey.France is an outlier among developed countries in general, and European countries in particular, in having a fairly high rate of natural population growth: by birth rates alone, France was responsible for almost all natural population growth in the European Union in 2006, with the natural growth rate (excess of births over deaths) rising to 300,000.
This was the highest rate since the end of the baby boom in 1973, and coincides with the rise of the total fertility rate from a nadir of 1.7 in 1994 to 2.0 in 2010.
From 2006 to 2011 population growth was on average +0.6% per year.
Immigrants are also major contributors to this trend; in 2010, 27% of newborns in metropolitan France had at least one foreign-born parent and 24% had at least one parent born outside of Europe (parents born in overseas territories are considered as born in France).France is a highly-urbanized country, with its largest cities (in terms of metropolitan area population) being Paris (11,836,970), Lyon (1,757,180), Marseille (1,618,369), Lille (1,163,934), Toulouse (1,118,472), Bordeaux (1,009,313), Nice (999,678), Nantes (768,305).
A perennial political issue concerns rural flight.
What percentage of adults smoke in South Korea?
Although life expectancy has increased significantly since 1950, South Korea faces a number of important health-care issues.
Foremost is the impact of environmental pollution on an increasingly urbanized population.
According to the Ministry of Health and Welfare, chronic diseases account for the majority of diseases in South Korea, a condition exacerbated by the health care system's focus on treatment rather than prevention.
The incidence of chronic disease in South Korea hovers around 24 percent.
Approximately 33 percent of all adults smoke.
The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) rate of prevalence at the end of 2003 was less than 0.1 percent.
In 2001 central government expenditures on health care accounted for about 6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).
The suicide rate in the nation was 26 per 100,000 in 2008, the highest in the industrialized world.Young South Korean males were found to be the tallest in all of East Asia, resulting from healthy living conditions, economic development and changes in food culture.Based on the Asia-Pacific Advisory Committee on Influenza (APACI), South Korea ranked the highest of influenza vaccination in Asia with 311 vaccines per 1,000 people.South Korea has the highest suicide rate in the developed world.
How many forest ecoregions does Japan have?
Japan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands.
They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the Ryūkyū and Bonin Islands, to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands.
Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife, including the brown bear, the Japanese macaque, the Japanese raccoon dog, and the Japanese giant salamander.
A large network of national parks has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as thirty-seven Ramsar wetland sites.
Four sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their outstanding natural value.
What kind of language did India first use in literature?
The earliest literary writings in India, composed between 1400 BCE and 1200 CE, were in the Sanskrit language.
Prominent works of this Sanskrit literature include epics such as the "Mahābhārata" and the "Ramayana", the dramas of Kālidāsa such as the "Abhijñānaśākuntalam" ("The Recognition of Śakuntalā"), and poetry such as the "Mahākāvya".
Kamasutra, the famous book about sexual intercourse also originated in India.
Developed between 600 BCE and 300 CE in South India, the "Sangam" literature, consisting of 2,381 poems, is regarded as a predecessor of Tamil literature.
From the 14th to the 18th centuries, India's literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the emergence of devotional poets such as Kabīr, Tulsīdās, and Guru Nānak.
This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions.
In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions.
In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the works of Bengali poet and novelist Rabindranath Tagore.
Who was the first Indonesian scholkar to use the nane Indonesia?
The name "Indonesia" derives from the Greek words "Indós" and "nèsos", which means "island".
The name dates to the 18th century, far predating the formation of independent Indonesia.
In 1850, George Windsor Earl, an English ethnologist, proposed the terms "Indunesians" — and, his preference, "Malayunesians" — for the inhabitants of the "Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago".
In the same publication, a student of Earl's, James Richardson Logan, used "Indonesia" as a synonym for "Indian Archipelago".
However, Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use "Indonesia".
Instead, they used the terms "Malay Archipelago" ("Maleische Archipel"); the "Netherlands East Indies" ("Nederlandsch Oost Indië"), popularly "Indië"; "the East" ("de Oost"); and "Insulinde".After 1900, the name "Indonesia" became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands, and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression.
Adolf Bastian, of the University of Berlin, popularized the name through his book "Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayischen Archipels, 1884–1894".
The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat (Ki Hajar Dewantara), when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name "Indonesisch Pers-bureau" in 1913.
Who was Brazil's first woman president?
Several brief interim governments succeeded after Vargas's suicide.
Juscelino Kubitschek became president in 1956 and assumed a conciliatory posture towards the political opposition that allowed him to govern without major crises.
The economy and industrial sector grew remarkably, but his greatest achievement was the construction of the new capital city of Brasília, inaugurated in 1960.
His successor was Jânio Quadros, who resigned in 1961 less than a year after taking office.
His vice-president, João Goulart, assumed the presidency, but aroused strong political opposition and was deposed in April 1964 by a coup that resulted in a military regime.The new regime was intended to be transitory but it gradually closed in on itself and became a full dictatorship with the promulgation of the Fifth Institutional Act in 1968.
The repression was not limited only to those who resorted to guerrilla tactics to fight the regime, but also reached institutional opponents, artists, journalists and other members of civil society, inside and outside the country (through the infamous "Operation Condor").
Despite its brutality, like other totalitarian regimes in history, due to an economic boom, known as an "economic miracle", the regime reached its highest level of popularity in the early 1970s.Slowly however, the wear and tear of years of dictatorial power that has not slowed the repression, even after the defeat of the leftist guerrillas, plus the inability to deal with the economic crises of the period and popular pressure, made it inevitable an opening policy, which of the regime side was led by Generals Geisel and Golbery.
With the enactment of the Amnesty Law in 1979, Brazil began to slowly return to democracy, which would be completed along the 1980s.Civilians returned to power in 1985 when José Sarney assumed the presidency, becoming unpopular during his tenure due his failure in control the economic crisis and hyperinflation inherited from the military regime.
Sarney's unsuccessful government allowed the election in 1989 of the almost unknown Fernando Collor, who was subsequently impeached by the National Congress in 1992.
Collor was succeeded by his Vice-President Itamar Franco, who appointed Fernando Henrique Cardoso as Minister of Finance.
In 1994, Cardoso produced a highly successful Plano Real, that after decades of failed economic plans made by previous governments attempting to curb hyperinflation, finally granted stability to the Brazilian economy, leading Cardoso to be elected that year, and again in 1998.The peaceful transition of power from Fernando Henrique to his main opposition leader, Luís Inácio Lula da Silva, who was elected in 2002 and re-elected in 2006, proved that Brazil had finally succeeded in achieving its long-sought political stability.
Lula was succeeded in 2011 by the current president, Dilma Rousseff, the country's first woman president and as such one of the most powerful women in the world.In June 2013, following the viral phenomenon of worldwide manifestations (such as the ""Arab Spring"", the ""Occupy Wall Street"" and the ""Spanish Indignados""), numerous protests erupted in Brazil.
For days, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in several cities to protest.
Initially a movement against the increase in public transport fares, it assumed gigantic proportions, sparked by the excessive use of force by the state polices, turning into a series of huge demonstrations by groups and individuals, angry about a range of issues (including new stadium projects for international sports events, demands on quality of public services, anger about corruption, and opposition to a constitutional amendment proposal, PEC 37, which is interpreted by some as an attempt to curb repression of corruption).
Thus it became a movement containing conflicting ideologies, with so far no single political agenda nor recognizable leadership.
When was an agreement signed for China's help?
As of 2012, nuclear power in Pakistan is provided by three licensed-commercial nuclear power plants.
Pakistan is the first Muslim country in the world to construct and operate civil nuclear power plants.
The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), the scientific and nuclear governmental agency, is solely responsible for operating these power plants.
As of 2012, the electricity generated by commercial nuclear power plants constitutes roughly ~3.6% of electricity generated in Pakistan, compared to ~62% from fossil fuel, ~33% from hydroelectric power and ~0.3% from coal.
Pakistan is one of the four nuclear armed states (along with India, Israel, and North Korea) that is not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty but is a member in good standing of the International Atomic Energy Agency.The People's Republic of China has been a strong vocal and avid supporter of Pakistan's nuclear power generation programme from early on.
In 2005, both Pakistan government and the Chinese government adopted an Energy Security Plan, calling for a huge increase in generating capacity to more than 160,000 MWe by 2030.
Pakistan Government plans for lifting nuclear capacity to 8800 MWe, 900 MWe of it by 2015 and a further 1500 MWe by 2020.In June 2008, the Pakistani Government announced plans to build commercial nuclear power plants III and IV commercial nuclear power plants at Chashma, Punjab Province, each with 320–340 MWe and costing PKR 129 billion, 80 billion of this from international sources, principally China.
A further agreement for China's help with the project was signed in October 2008, and given prominence as a counter to the US–India agreement shortly preceding it.
Cost quoted then was US$ 1.7 billion, with a foreign loan component of $1.07 billion.
What was the Nigerian Military charged with ?
The Nigerian Military are charged with protecting The Federal Republic of Nigeria, promoting Nigeria's global security interests, and supporting peacekeeping efforts especially in West Africa.The Nigerian Military consist of an army, a navy and an air force.
The military in Nigeria have played a major role in the country's history since independence.
Various juntas have seized control of the country and ruled it through most of its history.
Its last period of rule ended in 1999 following the sudden death of former dictator Sani Abacha in 1998, with his successor, Abdulsalam Abubakar, handing over power to the democratically elected government of Olusegun Obasanjo in 1999.Taking advantage of its role as Africa's most populated country, Nigeria has repositioned its military as an African peacekeeping force.
Since 1995, the Nigerian military through ECOMOG mandates have been deployed as peacekeepers in Liberia (1997), Ivory Coast (1997–1999), Sierra Leone 1997–1999, and presently in Sudan's Darfur region under an African Union mandate.
When did Maria Candelaria win the Palme d'Or?
Mexican films from the Golden Age in the 1940s and 1950s are the greatest examples of Latin American cinema, with a huge industry comparable to the Hollywood of those years.
Mexican films were exported and exhibited in all of Latin America and Europe.
Maria Candelaria (1944) by Emilio Fernández, was one of the first films awarded a Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1946, the first time the event was held after World War II.
The famous Spanish-born director Luis Buñuel realized in Mexico, between 1947 to 1965 some of him master pieces like Los Olvidados (1949), Viridiana (1961) and El angel exterminador (1963).
Famous actors and actresses from this period include María Félix, Pedro Infante, Dolores del Río, Jorge Negrete and the comedian Cantinflas.More recently, films such as Como agua para chocolate (1992), Cronos (1993), Y tu mamá también (2001), and Pan's Labyrinth (2006) have been successful in creating universal stories about contemporary subjects, and were internationally recognised, as in the prestigious Cannes Film Festival.
Mexican directors Alejandro González Iñárritu (Amores perros, Babel), Alfonso Cuarón (Children of Men, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban), Guillermo del Toro, Carlos Carrera (The Crime of Father Amaro), and screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga are some of the most known present-day film makers.Two of the major television networks based in Mexico are Televisa and TV Azteca.
Televisa is also the largest producer of Spanish-language content in the world and also the world's largest Spanish-language media network.
Grupo Multimedios is another media conglomerate with Spanish-language broadcasting in Mexico, Spain, and the United States.
The "telenovelas" are very traditional in Mexico and are translated to many languages and seen all over the world with renowned names like Verónica Castro, Lucía Méndez, Lucero, and Thalía.
What percentage of the population is of the Viet or Kinh ethnic group?
According to the 2009 census, the dominant Viet or Kinh ethnic group constituted nearly 73.6 million people, or 85.8% of the population.
The Kinh population is concentrated mainly in the alluvial deltas and coastal plains of the country.
A largely homogeneous social and ethnic group, the Kinh possess significant political and economic influence over the country.
However, Vietnam is also home to 54 ethnic minority groups, including the Hmong, Dao, Tay, Thai, and Nùng.
Many ethnic minorities – such as the Muong, who are closely related to the Kinh – dwell in the highlands, which cover two-thirds of Vietnam's territory.
Before the Vietnam War, the population of the Central Highlands was almost exclusively Degar (including over 40 tribal groups); however, Ngô Đình Diệm's South Vietnamese government enacted a program of resettling Kinh in indigenous areas.
The Hoa (ethnic Chinese) and Khmer Krom people are mainly lowlanders.
As Sino-Vietnamese relations soured in 1978 and 1979, some 450,000 Hoa left Vietnam.
What are religiouos carnivals called in Egypt?
Egypt celebrates many festivals and religious carnivals, also known as "mulid".
They are usually associated with a particular Coptic or Sufi saint, but are often celebrated by Egyptians irrespective of creed or religion.
Ramadan has a special flavor in Egypt, celebrated with sounds, lights (local lanterns known as "fawanees") and much flare that many Muslim tourists from the region flock to Egypt to witness during Ramadan.The ancient spring festival of Sham en Nisim (Coptic: "shom en nisim") has been celebrated by Egyptians for thousands of years, typically between the Egyptian months of Paremoude (April) and Pashons (May), following Easter Sunday.
What is the state religion of Turkey?
Turkey is a secular state with no official state religion; the Turkish Constitution provides for freedom of religion and conscience.
The role of religion has been a controversial debate over the years since the formation of Islamist parties.
For many decades, the wearing of the hijab was banned in schools and government buildings, because it was viewed as a symbol of political Islam.
However, the ban was lifted for the universities in 2011 and for the government buildings in 2013.Islam is the dominant religion of Turkey; it exceeds 99% if secular people of Muslim background are included, with the most popular sect being the Hanafite school of Sunni Islam.
The highest Islamic religious authority is the Presidency of Religious Affairs (), it interprets the Hanafi school of law, and is responsible for regulating the operation of the country's 80,000 registered mosques and employing local and provincial imams.
Academics suggest the Alevi population may be from 15 to 20 million.
According to Aksiyon magazine, the number of Shiite Twelvers (excluding Alevis) is 3 million (4.2%).
There are also some Sufi practitioners.
Roughly 2% are non-denominational Muslims.The percentage of non-Muslims in Turkey had fallen from 19.1% in 1914 to 2.5% in 1927.
Currently, there are about 120,000 people of different Christian denominations, representing less than 0.2% of Turkey's population, including an estimated 80,000 Oriental Orthodox, 35,000 Roman Catholics, 5,000 Greek Orthodox and smaller numbers of Protestants.
Today there are 236 churches open for worship in Turkey.
The Eastern Orthodox Church has been headquartered in Istanbul since the 4th century.There are about 26,000 people who are Jewish, the vast majority of whom are Sephardi.
The Bahá'í Faith in Turkey has roots in Bahá'u'lláh's, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, being exiled to Constantinople, current-day Istanbul, by the Ottoman authorities.
Bahá'ís cannot register with the government officially, but there are probably 10 to 20 thousand Bahá'ís, and around a hundred Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assemblies in Turkey.
What alphabet does the German language use?
German is the official and predominant spoken language in Germany.
It is one of 23 official languages in the European Union, and one of the three working languages of the European Commission.Recognised native minority languages in Germany are Danish, Low German, Sorbian, Romany, and Frisian; they are officially protected by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.
The most used immigrant languages are Turkish, Kurdish, Polish, the Balkan languages, and Russian.
67% of German citizens claim to be able to communicate in at least one foreign language and 27% in at least two languages other than their own.</ref>Standard German is a West Germanic language and is closely related to and classified alongside English, Low German, Dutch, and the Frisian languages.
To a lesser extent, it is also related to the East (extinct) and North Germanic languages.
Most German vocabulary is derived from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family.
Significant minorities of words are derived from Latin and Greek, with a smaller amount from French and most recently English (known as Denglisch).
German is written using the Latin alphabet.
German dialects, traditional local varieties traced back to the Germanic tribes, are distinguished from varieties of standard German by their lexicon, phonology, and syntax.
What was Thailand formerly known as?
Thailand ( or ; , ), officially the Kingdom of Thailand (, ; ), formerly known as Siam (; ), is a country located at the centre of the Indochina peninsula in Southeast Asia.
It is bordered to the north by Burma and Laos, to the east by Laos and Cambodia, to the south by the Gulf of Thailand and Malaysia, and to the west by the Andaman Sea and the southern extremity of Burma.
Its maritime boundaries include Vietnam in the Gulf of Thailand to the southeast, and Indonesia and India in the Andaman Sea to the southwest.The country is a constitutional monarchy, headed by King Rama IX, the ninth king of the House of Chakri, who, having reigned since 1946, is the world's longest-serving current head of state and the longest-reigning monarch in Thai history.
The king of Thailand is titled Head of State, Head of the Armed Forces, Adherent of Buddhism, and Upholder of religions.Thailand is the world's 51st-largest country in terms of total area, with an area of approximately , and is the 20th-most-populous country, with around 64 million people.
The capital and largest city is Bangkok, which is Thailand's political, commercial, industrial and cultural hub.
About 75–85% of the population is ethnically Tai, which includes the four major regional groups, consisting of Central Thai (Khon Pak Klang): 30%; Northeastern Thai (Khon Isan): 22%, Northern Thai (Khon Lanna): 9%; and Southern Thai (Khon Tai): 7%.
Thai Chinese, those of significant Chinese heritage, are 14% of the population and up to 40% possess part-Chinese ancestry.
Thai Malays represent 3% of the population and the rest belong to minority groups, including Mons, Khmers and various "hill tribes".
The country's official language is Thai and the primary religion is Buddhism, which is practised by around 95% of the population.Thailand experienced rapid economic growth between 1985 and 1996, and is presently a newly industrialized country and a major exporter.
Tourism also contributes significantly to the Thai economy.
The country was ranked second in the 2014 United Nations Human Development Index (HDI), which measures quality of life according to areas such as life expectancy and income.There are approximately 2.2 million legal and illegal migrants in Thailand, and the country attracts a significant number of expatriates from developed countries.
Who established the basis of the modern Italian Language
The basis of the modern Italian language was established by the Florentine poet Dante Alighieri, whose greatest work, the Divine Comedy, is considered among the foremost literary statements produced in Europe during the Middle Ages.
There is no shortage of celebrated literary figures in Italy: Giovanni Boccaccio, Giacomo Leopardi, Alessandro Manzoni, Torquato Tasso, Ludovico Ariosto, and Petrarch, whose best-known vehicle of expression, the sonnet, was created in Italy.Prominent philosophers include Giordano Bruno, Marsilio Ficino, Niccolò Machiavelli, and Giambattista Vico.
Modern literary figures and Nobel laureates are nationalist poet Giosuè Carducci in 1906, realist writer Grazia Deledda in 1926, modern theatre author Luigi Pirandello in 1936, poets Salvatore Quasimodo in 1959 and Eugenio Montale in 1975, satirist and theatre author Dario Fo in 1997.Carlo Collodi's 1883 novel, "The Adventures of Pinocchio", is the most celebrated children's classic by an Italian author.Italian theatre can be traced back to the Roman tradition which was heavily influenced by the Greek; as with many other literary genres, Roman dramatists tended to adapt and translate from the Greek.
For example, Seneca's "Phaedra" was based on that of Euripides, and many of the comedies of Plautus were direct translations of works by Menander.
During the 16th century and on into the 18th century, Commedia dell'arte was a form of improvisational theatre, and it is still performed today.
Travelling troupes of players would set up an outdoor stage and provide amusement in the form of juggling, acrobatics, and, more typically, humorous plays based on a repertoire of established characters with a rough storyline, called "canovaccio".
How many provinces does Canada have?
Canada is a federation composed of ten provinces and three territories.
In turn, these may be grouped into four main regions: Western Canada, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Canada ("Eastern Canada" refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together).
Provinces have more autonomy than territories, having responsibility for social programs such as health care, education, and welfare.
Together, the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, an almost unique structure among federations in the world.
Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the Canada Health Act; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice.
Equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure that reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.
One of the possible origins of the name "Hispania" is a derivation of the the Punic "I-Shpania" which means Island of what animal?
The origins of the Roman name "Hispania", from which the modern name "España" was derived, are uncertain and are possibly unknown due to the inadequate evidence.
"Hispania" may derive from the poetic use of the term "Hesperia", reflecting the Greek perception of Italy as a "western land" or "land of the setting sun" ("Hesperia", "Ἑσπερία" in Greek) and Spain, being still further west, as "Hesperia ultima".It may also be a derivation of the Punic "I-Shpania" (אי שפניא), meaning "island of rabbits", "land of rabbits" or "edge", a reference to Spain's location at the end of the Mediterranean; Roman coins struck in the region from the reign of Hadrian show a female figure with a coney at her feet, and Strabo called it the "land of the rabbits".
There is also the claim that "Hispania" derives from the Basque word "Ezpanna" meaning "edge" or "border", another reference to the fact that the Iberian peninsula constitutes the southwest of the European continent.The Renaissance scholar Antonio de Nebrija proposed that the word "Hispania" evolved from the Iberian word "Hispalis", meaning "city of the western world".
Jesús Luis Cunchillos argues that the root of the term "span" is the Phoenecian word "spy", meaning "to forge metals".
Therefore "i-spn-ya" would mean "the land where metals are forged".Two 15th century Spanish Jewish scholars, Don Isaac Abrabanel and Shelomó ibn Verga, have given a different explanation as to how Spain derived its name.
Don Isaac Abrabanel was one of the principal persons of Spain’s Jewish community and one of the king’s trusted courtiers who witnessed the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492.
Both men wrote in two different published works that the first Jews to reach Spain were brought by ship by Phiros who was confederate with the king of Babylon when he laid siege to Jerusalem.
This man was a Grecian by birth, but who had been given a kingdom in Spain.
He became related by marriage to Espan, the nephew of king Heracles, who also ruled over a kingdom in Spain.
Heracles later renounced his throne in preference for his native Greece, leaving his kingdom to his nephew, Espan, from whom the country of España (Spain) took its name.
Based upon their testimonies, this eponym would have already been in use in Spain by c. 350 BCE.
When was the Lord of The Rings published?
Although "The Lord of the Rings" was published in the 1950s, Tolkien insisted that the One Ring was not an allegory for the Atomic Bomb, nor were his works a strict allegory of any kind, but were open to interpretation as the reader saw fit.A few critics have found what they consider to be racial elements in the story, generally based upon their views of how Tolkien's imagery depicts good and evil, characters' race (e.g.
Elf, Dwarf, Hobbit, Southron, Númenórean, Orc); and that the character's race is seen as determining their behaviour.
Counter-arguments note that race-focused critiques often omit relevant textual evidence to the contrary, cite imagery from adaptations rather than the work itself; ignore the absence of evidence of racist attitudes or events in the author's personal life and claim that the perception of racism is itself a marginal view.Critics have also seen social class rather than race as being the determinant factor for the portrayal of good and evil.
Commentators such as science fiction author David Brin have interpreted the work to hold unquestioning devotion to a traditional elitist social structure.
In his essay "Epic Pooh", science fiction and fantasy author Michael Moorcock critiques the world-view displayed by the book as deeply conservative, in both the 'paternalism' of the narrative voice and the power-structures in the narrative.
Tom Shippey cites the origin of this portrayal of evil as a reflection of the prejudices of European middle-classes during the inter-war years towards the industrial working class.Other observers have cited Christian and Catholic themes in "The Lord of the Rings".The book has been read as fitting the model of Joseph Campbell's "monomyth".

How much did the film gross?
Terminator Salvation is a 2009 American science fiction action film directed by McG and starring Christian Bale and Sam Worthington.
It is the fourth installment in the "Terminator" series.
In a departure from the previous installments, which were set between 1984 and 2004 and used time travel as a key plot element, "Salvation" is set in 2018 and focuses on the war between Skynet and humanity, with the human Resistance fighting against Skynet's killing machines.
Bale portrays John Connor, a Resistance fighter and the franchise's central character, while Worthington portrays cyborg Marcus Wright.
"Terminator Salvation" also features Anton Yelchin as a young Kyle Reese, a character first introduced in "The Terminator", and depicts the origin of the T-800 Model 101 Terminator.After a troubled pre-production, with The Halcyon Company acquiring the rights for the franchise from Andrew G. Vajna and Mario Kassar and several writers working on the screenplay, filming began in May 2008 in New Mexico and ran for 77 days.
"Terminator Salvation" was released on May 21, 2009 in the United States and Canada, followed by early June releases in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.
Warner Bros. handled the North America release and Columbia Pictures the international one.
The film grossed over $371 million worldwide, but received negative reviews which criticized the story and the absence of Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was replaced by a digital computer graphics version.
Who produced the movie Shrek
Shrek is a 2001 American computer-animated fantasy-comedy film produced by PDI/DreamWorks, released by DreamWorks Pictures, directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, featuring the voices of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow.
It is loosely based on William Steig's 1990 fairy tale picture book "Shrek!
", and somewhat serves as a parody film, targeting other films adapted from numerous children's fantasies (mainly animated Disney films).
The film made notable use of popular music; the soundtrack includes music by Smash Mouth, Eels, Joan Jett, The Proclaimers, Jason Wade, Baha Men, and John Cale (covering Leonard Cohen).The rights to the books were originally bought by Steven Spielberg in 1991, before the founding of DreamWorks, when he thought about making a traditionally animated film based on the book.
However, John H. Williams convinced him to bring the film to DreamWorks in 1994, the time the studio was founded, and the film was put quickly into active development by Jeffrey Katzenberg after the rights were bought by the studio in 1995.
"Shrek" originally cast Chris Farley to do the voice for the title character, recording about 80%–90% of his dialog.
After Farley died in 1997 before he could finish, Mike Myers was brought in to work for the character, who after his first recording decided to record his voice in a Scottish accent.
The film was also originally planned to be motion-captured, but after poor results, the studio decided to get PDI to help "Shrek" get its final computer-animated look.Earning $484.4 million at the worldwide box office, the film was a critical and commercial success.
"Shrek" also received promotion from food chains such as Baskin-Robbins (promoting the film's DVD release) and Burger King.
It was acclaimed as an animated film worthy of adult interest, with many adult-oriented jokes and themes but a simple enough plot and humour to appeal to children.
"Shrek" won the first ever Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.
The film was also nominated for six British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards, including the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Eddie Murphy for his voice-over performance as Donkey, and won the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.
The film's main (and title) character was awarded his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in May 2010.
"Shrek" established DreamWorks Animation as a prime competitor to Pixar in the field of feature film animation, particularly in computer animation.
The film's success prompted DreamWorks to create three sequels, "Shrek 2", "Shrek the Third", and "Shrek Forever After", two holiday specials, "Shrek the Halls" and "Scared Shrekless", and a spin-off film, "Puss in Boots".
A fifth film, planned as the last of the series, was cancelled in 2009 with the announcement that the fourth film would conclude the series.
The film's success also inspired other merchandise, such as video games, a stage musical and even a comic book by Dark Horse Comics.
Why does Woody need to be rescued?
"Toy Story" has spawned two sequels: "Toy Story 2" (1999) and "Toy Story 3" (2010).
Initially, the first sequel to "Toy Story" was going to be a direct-to-video release, with development beginning in 1996.
However, after the cast from "Toy Story" returned and the story was considered to be better than that of a direct-to-video release, it was announced in 1998 that the sequel would see a theatrical release.
The sequel saw the return of the majority of the voice cast from "Toy Story", and the film focuses on rescuing Woody after he is stolen at a yard sale.
The film was equally well received by critics, earning a rare 100% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 125 reviews.

Again, the majority of the cast from the prior two films returned.
It was the first film in the franchise to be released in 3-D for its first run, though the first two films, which were originally released in 2-D, were re-released in 3-D in 2009 as a double feature.
Like its predecessors, "Toy Story 3" received enormous critical acclaim, earning a 99% approval rating from Rotten Tomatoes.
It also grossed more than $1 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing animated film to date.In November 1996, the Disney on Ice: Toy Story ice show opened which featured the cast's voices as well as Randy Newman's music.
In April 2008, the "Disney Wonder" cruise ship launched "" shows on its cruises.
"Toy Story" also led to a spin-off direct-to-video animated film, "", as well as the animated television series "Buzz Lightyear of Star Command".
The film and series followed Buzz Lightyear and his friends at Star Command as they uphold justice across the galaxy.
Although the film was criticized for not using the same animation as in "Toy Story" and "Toy Story 2", it sold three million VHS and DVDs in its first week of release.
The series ran for 65 episodes.Following the release of "Toy Story 3", a series of "Toy Story" short films have been shown in theaters in front of other Disney features: "Hawaiian Vacation" (shown before "Cars 2"), centering around Barbie and Ken on vacation in Bonnie's room, "Small Fry" (shown before "The Muppets"), centering on Buzz being left in a fast-food restaurant, and "Partysaurus Rex" (shown before "Finding Nemo 3D"), centering on Rex partying with Bonnie's bath toys.In January 2013, a fan-made live-action version of the film was posted on YouTube.In October 2013, ABC aired "Toy Story of TERROR!

What is the approval rating for Shawshank Redemption?
"Entertainment Weekly" reviewer Owen Gleiberman praised the choice of scenery, writing that the "moss-dark, saturated images have a redolent sensuality" that makes the film very realistic.
While praising Morgan Freeman's acting and oratory skills as making Red appear real, Gleiberman felt that with the "laconic-good-guy, neo-Gary Cooper role, Tim Robbins is unable to make Andy connect with the audience.
"The film garnered a 90% approval rating from 63 critics—an average rating of 8.2 out of 10—on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes.
Metacritic provides a score of 80 out of 100 from 19 critics, which indicates "generally favorable" reviews.
What was the video game version of The Godfather released?
In March 2006, a video game version of "The Godfather" was released by Electronic Arts.
Before his death, Marlon Brando provided voice work for Vito; however, owing to poor sound quality from Brando's failing health, only parts of the recordings could be used.
A sound-alike's voice had to be used in the "missing parts".
James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Abe Vigoda lent their voices and likenesses as well, and several other "Godfather" cast members had their likeness in the game.
However, Al Pacino's likeness and voice (Michael Corleone) was not in the game as Al Pacino sold his likeness and voice exclusively for use in the "" video game.
Francis Ford Coppola said in April 2005 that he was not informed and did not approve of Paramount allowing the game's production, and openly criticized the move.
What dramatic physical alteration to his body did Brad Pitt make for his role in Fight Club and why?
Producer Ross Bell met with actor Russell Crowe to discuss his candidacy for the role of Tyler Durden.
Producer Art Linson, who joined the project late, met with another candidate, Brad Pitt.
Linson was the senior producer of the two, so the studio sought to cast Pitt instead of Crowe.
Pitt was looking for a new film after the failure of his 1998 film "Meet Joe Black", and the studio believed "Fight Club" would be more commercially successful with a major star.
The studio signed Pitt and offered him a $17.5 million salary.For the role of the unnamed narrator, the studio desired a "sexier marquee name" like Matt Damon to increase the film's commercial prospects; it also considered Sean Penn.
Fincher instead considered Edward Norton a candidate for the role, based on the actor's performance in the 1996 film "The People vs. Larry Flynt".
Other studios were approaching Norton for leading roles in developing films like "The Talented Mr. Ripley" and "Man on the Moon".
The actor was cast in "Runaway Jury", but the film did not reach production.
20th Century Fox offered Norton a $2.5 million salary to attract him to "Fight Club".
Norton could not accept the offer immediately since he still owed Paramount Pictures a film; he had signed a contractual obligation with Paramount to appear in one of the studio's future films for a smaller salary (Norton later satisfied the obligation with his role in the 2003 film "The Italian Job").In January 1998, 20th Century Fox announced that Brad Pitt and Edward Norton were cast in the film.
The actors prepared for their roles by taking lessons in boxing, taekwondo, grappling, and soapmaking.
Pitt voluntarily visited a dentist to have pieces of his front teeth chipped off so his character would not have perfect teeth.
The pieces were restored after filming concluded.Fincher's first choice for the role of Marla Singer was Janeane Garofalo, who objected to the film's sexual content.
The filmmakers considered Courtney Love and Winona Ryder as candidates early on.
The studio wanted to cast Reese Witherspoon, but Fincher objected that she was too young for the role.
He chose to cast Helena Bonham Carter based on her performance in the 1997 film "The Wings of the Dove".
What year was the movie Forest Gump released
Forrest Gump is a 1994 American epic romantic comedy-drama film based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Winston Groom.
The film was directed by Robert Zemeckis and starred Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise and Sally Field.
The story depicts several decades in the life of Forrest Gump, a naïve and slow-witted yet athletically prodigious native of Alabama who witnesses, and in some cases influences, some of the defining events of the latter half of the 20th century in the United States; more specifically, the period between Forrest's birth in 1944 and 1982.The film differs substantially from Winston Groom's novel on which it is based, including Gump's personality and several events that were depicted.
Filming took place in late 1993, mainly in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.
Extensive visual effects were used to incorporate the protagonist into archived footage and to develop other scenes.
A comprehensive soundtrack was featured in the film, using music intended to pinpoint specific time periods portrayed on screen.
Its commercial release made it a top-selling soundtrack, selling over 12 million copies worldwide.Released in the United States on July 6, 1994, "Forrest Gump" received critical acclaim and became a commercial success as the top grossing film in North America released that year, being the first major success for Paramount Pictures since the studio's sale to Viacom earlier in the year.
The film earned over $677 million worldwide during its theatrical run.
The film won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director for Robert Zemeckis, Best Actor for Tom Hanks, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Visual Effects and Best Film Editing.
It also garnered multiple other awards and nominations, including Golden Globe Awards, People's Choice Awards and Young Artist Awards, among others.
Since the film's release, varying interpretations have been made of the film's protagonist and its political symbolism.
In 1996, a themed restaurant, Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, opened based on the film, and has since expanded to multiple locations worldwide.
The scene of Gump running across the country is often referred to when real-life people attempt the feat.
In 2011, the Library of Congress selected "Forrest Gump" for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

What was the metascore for 'The Usual Suspect'?
Reception.Critical.
"The Usual Suspects" was well received by most critics, and it has an 88% rating at Rotten Tomatoes and a 77 metascore on Metacritic.
While embraced by most viewers and critics, the film was the subject of harsh derision by some.
Roger Ebert, in a review for the "Chicago Sun-Times," gave the film one and a half stars out of four, considering it confusing and uninteresting.
He also included the movie in his "most hated films" list.
"USA Today" rated the film two and a half stars out of four, calling it "one of the most densely plotted mysteries in memory—though paradoxically, four-fifths of it is way too easy to predict."
However, "Rolling Stone" praised Spacey, saying his "balls-out brilliant performance is Oscar bait all the way."
In his review for "The Washington Post", Hal Hinson wrote, "Ultimately, "The Usual Suspects" may be too clever for its own good.
The twist at the end is a corker, but crucial questions remain unanswered.
What's interesting, though, is how little this intrudes on our enjoyment.
After the movie you're still trying to connect the dots and make it all fit—and these days, how often can we say that?"
In her review for "The New York Times", Janet Maslin praised the performances of the cast: "Mr. Singer has assembled a fine ensemble cast of actors who can parry such lines, and whose performances mesh effortlessly despite their exaggerated differences in demeanor ...
Without the violence or obvious bravado of "Reservoir Dogs," these performers still create strong and fascinatingly ambiguous characters."
"The Independent" praised the film's ending: "The film's coup de grace is as elegant as it is unexpected.
The whole movie plays back in your mind in perfect clarity—and turns out to be a completely different movie to the one you've been watching (rather better, in fact)."
When was Life is Beautiful released?
"Life is Beautiful" became commercially successful.
After Miramax Films released the film on 23 October 1998 in the United States, the film went on to gross $57,563,264 in North America, and $171,600,000 internationally, with a worldwide gross of $229,163,264.
It is the highest grossing movie to be made in Italy, and the second highest grossing foreign film in the United States.The film also received mostly positive reviews, with the film aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes giving the film a "Fresh" 80% rating.
Despite its acclaim, actor-director Roberto Benigni received criticism for its comedic elements incorporated into the backdrop of the Holocaust.
Roger Ebert gave the film 3 1/2 stars, stating, "At Cannes, it offended some left-wing critics with its use of humor in connection with the Holocaust.
What may be most offensive to both wings is its sidestepping of politics in favor of simple human ingenuity.
The film finds the right notes to negotiate its delicate subject matter."
Name two characters in The Lion King
Legacy.Sequels and spin-offs.Between 1995 and 1999, the characters of Timon and Pumbaa received their own animated show, "The Lion King's Timon and Pumbaa", which ran for three seasons and 85 episodes.
Ernie Sabella continued to voice Pumbaa, while Timon was voiced by Quinton Flynn and Kevin Schon in addition to Nathan Lane himself.In 1998, a sequel entitled "" was released on VHS.
The film centers around Simba and Nala's daughter, Kiara, who falls in love with Kovu, a male lion who was raised in a pride of Scar's followers, the Outsiders.

It is a prequel in showing how Timon and Pumbaa met each other, and also a parallel in that it also depicts what the characters were retconned to have done during the events of the original movie.
Who was the suspect in the Dark Knight Rises Shooting?
On July 20, 2012, during a midnight showing of the film at the Century 16 cinema in Aurora, Colorado, a gunman wearing a gas mask opened fire inside the theater, killing 12 people and injuring 58 others.
Police responding to the shooting apprehended a suspect, later identified as 24-year-old James Eagan Holmes, shortly after arriving on the scene.
At the time of his arrest, Holmes allegedly identified himself as the Joker to police.Warner Bros. stated that it was deeply saddened by the shooting, and announced the cancellation of the Paris, Mexico, and Japan premieres of "The Dark Knight Rises", and suspended the marketing campaign for the film in Finland.
Several broadcast networks also suspended television ads for the film in the United States because of the tragedy.
The trailer for "Gangster Squad", another Warner Bros. movie which was included in the screening of "The Dark Knight Rises", has been removed as it contains a scene which shows gangsters shooting submachine guns at moviegoers through the screen, similar to the shooting in Aurora.
Director Christopher Nolan released a public statement calling the shooting "unbearably savage".
Other stars of the film released statements expressing their condolences, with star Christian Bale paying a personal visit to the survivors and the memorial in Aurora.
How many ardent Nazis where in the crew?
In the film, there is only one ardent Nazi in the crew of 40, namely the First Watch Officer (referred to comically in one scene as "Unser Hitlerjugendführer", "Our Hitler Youth Leader"), with the rest of the officers either indifferent or, in the Captain's case, openly cynical.
The enlisted sailors and non-commissioned officers are portrayed as apolitical.
In his book "Iron Coffins", former U-boat commander Herbert A. Werner states that the selection of naval personnel based on their loyalty to the party occurred only later in the war (from 1943 onward), when the U-boats were suffering high casualties.
At that stage in the war, morale was surely declining and this degree of skepticism may have occurred.
In support of "Das Boot" on this subject, U-Boat historian Michael Gannon maintains that the U-boat navy was one of the least pro-Nazi branches of the German armed forces.Even though the beginning and the end of the film occur in the port of La Rochelle, it does not correspond historically.
The submarine base in La Rochelle was not functional before November 1941, and at the time of the film the port was dried up.
Moreover, none of the British fighter-bombers of late 1941 to early 1942 had the range to bomb La Rochelle from bases in the U.K.; however, it is possible the fighters were carrier-based and not land based.
While Saint-Nazaire was the base used in the novel, the film was changed to La Rochelle because its appearance had not changed to such a large degree in the years since World War II.In real life, the "U-96" was based at Saint-Nazaire in late 1941.
It survived this period, but much like its on-screen fate, it actually was sunk by Allied bombers at its berth in Wilhelmshaven in March 1945.
How many stars did Alan Morrison give the film?
Alan Morrison from "Empire" Online gave "Amélie" five stars and called it "one of the year’s best, with crossover potential along the lines of "Cyrano De Bergerac" and "Il Postino".
Given its quirky heart, it might well surpass them all.
"Paul Tatara from CNN Reviewer praised "Amélie"s playful nature.
In his review, he wrote, "Its whimsical, free-ranging nature is often enchanting; the first hour, in particular, is brimming with amiable, sardonic laughs.
"The film was attacked by critic Serge Kaganski of "Les Inrockuptibles" for an unrealistic and picturesque vision of a bygone French society with few ethnic minorities.
Jeunet dismissed the criticism by pointing out that the photo collection contains pictures of people from numerous ethnic backgrounds, and that Jamel Debbouze, who plays Lucien, is of Moroccan descent.
What has Unkirch said about a possible Toy Story 4?
According to an article on NOLA.com, "Toy Story 3" director Lee Unkrich has confirmed that a "Toy Story 4" sequel is not being planned.
"Well, we don't have any plans for "Toy Story 4"," Unkrich said.
"I'm flattered that people ask about it—it reminds me how much people love the characters, but it was really important to me with this film that we not just create another sequel, that it not just be another appendage coming off of the other two."
Unkrich went on to say, "there may be opportunities for Woody and Buzz in the future, but we don't have any plans for anything right now."
It has also been reported that Hanks and Allen have signed on for a "Toy Story 4" if Pixar ever decides to produce one.
In a BBC interview in 2011, Hanks said that he thought Pixar was working on a sequel.
Disney denied the rumors saying, "nothing is official."
What artists are featured on the soundtrack to the 2010 film "Despicable Me?
"Despicable Me: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack" is the soundtrack to the film of the same name, and it was released on July 6, 2010.
It featured new songs from the film written and performed by Pharrell Williams, and performances by Destinee & Paris, The Sylvers, Robin Thicke and The Bee Gees.
Who started the process of designing the Tumbler
Crowley started the process of designing the Tumbler for the film by model bashing.
Crowley used the nose cone of a P-38 Lightning model to serve as the chassis for the Tumbler's turbine engine.
Six models of the Tumbler were built to 1:12 scale in the course of four months.
Following the scale model creation, a crew of over 30 people, including Crowley and engineers Chris Culvert and Annie Smith, carved a full-size replica of the Tumbler out of a large block of Styrofoam in two months.The Styrofoam model was used to create a steel "test frame", which had to stand up to several standards: have a speed of over , go from 0 to in 5 seconds, possess a steering system to make sharp turns at city corners, and withstand a self-propelled launch of up to .
On the first jump test, the Tumbler's front end collapsed and had to be completely rebuilt.
The basic configuration of the newly designed Tumbler included a 5.7-liter Chevy V8 engine, a truck axle for the rear axle, front tires by Hoosier (which are actually dirt racing tires used on the right rear of open wheel sprint cars), 4 rear 44/18.5-16.5 Interco Super Swamper TSL tires (44" tall, 18.5" wide, mounted on a 16.5" wheel) and the suspension system of Baja racing trucks.
The design and development process took nine months and cost several million dollars.With the design process complete, four street-ready race cars were constructed, with each vehicle possessing 65 panels and costing $250,000 to build.
Two of the four cars were specialized versions.
One version was the flap version, which had hydraulics and flaps to detail the close-up shots where the vehicle propelled itself through the air.
The other version was the jet version, in which an actual jet engine was mounted onto the vehicle, fueled by six propane tanks.
The visibility inside the vehicle was poor, so monitors were connected to cameras on the vehicle body.
The professional drivers for the Tumblers practiced driving the vehicles for six months before they drove on the streets of Chicago for the film's scenes.The interior of the Tumbler was an immobile studio set and not actually the interior of a street-capable Tumbler.
The cockpit was over-sized to fit cameras for scenes filmed in the Tumbler interior.
In addition, another version of the Tumbler was a miniature model that was 1:6 scale of the actual Tumbler.
This miniature model had an electric motor and was used to show the Tumbler flying across ravines and between buildings.
However, the actual Tumbler was used for the waterfall sequence.
Who was promoted to Corporal at the age of 10?
Austria invaded and fought the Serbian army at the Battle of Cer and Battle of Kolubara beginning on 12 August.
Over the next two weeks, Austrian attacks were thrown back with heavy losses, which marked the first major Allied victories of the war and dashed Austro-Hungarian hopes of a swift victory.
As a result, Austria had to keep sizable forces on the Serbian front, weakening its efforts against Russia.
Serbia's defeat of the Austro-Hungarian invasion of 1914 counts among the major upset victories of the last century.This campaign had the youngest known soldier of World War I. Momčilo Gavrić, born in Trbušnica, joined the 6th Artillery Division of the Serbian Army when he was 8 years old, after Austro-Hungarian troops killed his parents, grandmother, and seven of his siblings in August 1914.
At the age of 10 he was promoted to Corporal, and at the age of 11 he became a Lance Sergeant.
When did the Americans extract a British commitment to limit Allied operations in the mediterranean?
Axis advance stalls (1942–43).In January, the United States, Britain, Soviet Union, China, and 22 smaller or exiled governments issued the Declaration by United Nations, thereby affirming the Atlantic Charter, and agreeing to not to sign separate peace with the Axis powers.During 1942 Allied officials debated on the appropriate grand strategy to pursue.
All agreed that defeating Germany was the primary objective.
The Americans favoured a straightforward, large-scale attack on Germany through France.
The Soviets were also demanding a second front.
The British, on the other hand, argued that military operations should target peripheral areas in order to throw a "ring" around Germany which would wear out German strength, lead to increasing demoralisation, and bolster resistance forces.
Germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing campaign.
An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by Allied armour without using large-scale armies.
Eventually, the British persuaded the Americans that a landing in France was infeasible in 1942 and they should instead focus on driving the Axis out of North Africa.At the Casablanca Conference in early 1943 the Allies issued a declaration declaring that they would not negotiate with their enemies and demanded their unconditional surrender.
The British and Americans agreed to continue to press the initiative in the Mediterranean by invading Sicily to fully secure the Mediterranean supply routes.
Although the British argued for further operations in the Balkans to bring Turkey into the war, in May 1943 the Americans extracted a British commitment to limit Allied operations in the Mediterranean to an invasion of the Italian mainland and to invade France in 1944.
What was the name of the play Lincoln was attending when he got shot?
United States President Abraham Lincoln was shot on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, while attending the play "Our American Cousin" at Ford's Theatre as the American Civil War was drawing to a close.
The assassination occurred five days after the commander of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, General Robert E. Lee, surrendered to Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant and the Union Army of the Potomac, ending the American Civil War.
Lincoln was the first American president to be assassinated, though an unsuccessful attempt had been made on Andrew Jackson 30 years before in 1835.The assassination of Lincoln was planned and carried out by the well-known stage actor John Wilkes Booth, as part of a larger conspiracy in a bid to revive the Confederate cause.Booth's co-conspirators were Lewis Powell and David Herold, who were assigned to kill Secretary of State William H. Seward, and George Atzerodt who was to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson.
By simultaneously eliminating the top three people in the administration, Booth and his co-conspirators hoped to sever the continuity of the United States government.Lincoln was shot while watching the play "Our American Cousin" with his wife Mary Todd Lincoln at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C..
He died early the next morning.
The rest of the conspirators' plot failed; Powell only managed to wound Seward, while Atzerodt, Johnson's would-be assassin, lost his nerve and fled to Washington.
Who signed the Louisiana Purchase
On Saturday, April 30, 1803, the Louisiana Purchase Treaty was signed by Robert Livingston, James Monroe, and Barbé Marbois in Paris.
Jefferson announced the treaty to the American people on July 4.
After the signing of the Louisiana Purchase agreement in 1803, Livingston made this famous statement, "We have lived long, but this is the noblest work of our whole lives...From this day the United States take their place among the powers of the first rank.
"The United States Senate ratified the treaty with a vote of twenty-four to seven on October 20.
The Senators who voted against the treaty were: Simeon Olcott and William Plumer of New Hampshire, William Wells and Samuel White of Delaware, James Hillhouse and Uriah Tracy of Connecticut, and Timothy Pickering of Massachusetts.
On the following day, the Senate authorized President Jefferson to take possession of the territory and establish a temporary military government.
In legislation enacted on October 31, Congress made temporary provisions for local civil government to continue as it had under French and Spanish rule and authorized the President to use military forces to maintain order.
Plans were also set forth for several missions to explore and chart the territory, the most famous being the Lewis and Clark Expedition.France turned New Orleans over on December 20, 1803 at The Cabildo.
On March 10, 1804, a formal ceremony was conducted in St. Louis to transfer ownership of the territory from France to the United States.Effective on October 1, 1804, the purchased territory was organized into the Territory of Orleans (most of which became the state of Louisiana) and the District of Louisiana, which was temporarily under the control of the governor and judges of the Indiana Territory.
Which reactor complexes were the only ones constructed during the Manhattan Project
Although an air-cooled design was chosen for the reactor at Oak Ridge to facilitate rapid construction, it was recognized that this would be impractical for the much larger production reactors.
Initial designs by the Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont used helium for cooling, before they determined that a water-cooled reactor would be simpler, cheaper and quicker to build.
The design did not become available until 4 October 1943; in the meantime, Matthias concentrated on improving the Hanford site by erecting accommodations, improving the roads, building a railway switch line, and upgrading the electricity, water and telephone lines.As at Oak Ridge, the most difficulty was encountered while canning the uranium slugs, which commenced at Hanford in March 1944.
They were pickled to remove dirt and impurities, dipped in molten bronze, tin, and aluminum-silicon alloy, canned using hydraulic presses, and then capped using arc welding under an argon atmosphere.
Finally, they were subjected to a series of tests to detect holes or faulty welds.
Disappointingly, most canned slugs initially failed the tests, resulting in an output of only a handful of canned slugs per day.
But steady progress was made and by June 1944 production increased to the point where it appeared that enough canned slugs would be available to start Reactor B on schedule in August 1944.Work began on Reactor B, the first of six planned 250 MW reactors, on 10 October 1943.
The reactor complexes were given letter designations A through F, with B, D and F sites chosen to be developed first, as this maximised the distance between the reactors.
They would be the only ones constructed during the Manhattan Project.
Some of steel, of concrete, 50,000 concrete blocks and 71,000 concrete bricks were used to construct the high building.Construction of the reactor itself commenced in February 1944.
Watched by Compton, Matthias, DuPont's Crawford Greenewalt, Leona Woods and Fermi, who inserted the first slug, the reactor was powered up beginning on 13 September 1944.
Over the next few days, 838 tubes were loaded and the reactor went critical.
Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the control rods to initiate production.
At first all appeared well but around 03:00 the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely.
The cooling water was investigated to see if there was a leak or contamination.
The next day the reactor started up again, only to shut down once more.Fermi contacted Chien-Shiung Wu, who identified the cause of the problem as neutron poisoning from xenon-135, which has a half-life of 9.2 hours.
Fermi, Woods, Donald J. Hughes and John Archibald Wheeler then calculated the nuclear cross section of xenon-135, which turned out to be 30,000 times that of uranium.
Fortunately, DuPont engineer George Graves had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added an additional 504 tubes to fill in the corners.
The scientists had originally considered this overengineering a waste of time and money, but Fermi realized that by loading all 2,004 tubes, the reactor could reach the required power level and efficiently produce plutonium.
Reactor D was started on 17 December 1944 and Reactor F on 25 February 1945.
Madame Nhu was commander of what during Diem's presidency?
Unlike the American women who went to Vietnam, North Vietnamese women were enlisted and fought in the combat zone as well as provided manual labor to keep the Ho Chi Minh trail open, cook for the troops, and some served as "comfort women" for male communist fighters.
They also worked in the rice fields in North Vietnam and Viet Cong-held farming areas in South Vietnam's Mekong Delta region to provide food for their families and the war effort.
Women were enlisted in both the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) and the Viet Cong guerrilla insurgent force in South Vietnam.
Some women also served for the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong intelligence services.In South Vietnam, many women voluntarily serve in the ARVN's Women's Armed Force Corps (WAFC) and various other Women's corps in the military.
Some, like in the WAFC, fought in combat with other soldiers.
Others have served as nurses and doctors in the battlefield and in military hospitals, or served in South Vietnam or America's intelligence agencies.
During Diệm's presidency, Madame Nhu was the commander of the WAFC.
Who has been in the space race and how has it turned out?
The Soviet Union was secretly attempting to compete with the US in landing a man on the Moon but had been hampered by repeated failures in development of a launcher comparable to the Saturn V. Meanwhile, they tried to beat the US to return lunar material to the Earth by means of unmanned probes.
On July 13, three days before Apollo 11's launch, they launched Luna 15, which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11.
During descent, a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in Mare Crisium about two hours before Armstrong and Aldrin took off from the surface.
The Jodrell Bank Observatory radio telescope in England was later discovered to have recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent, and this was published in July 2009 on the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11.
Which King wanted to continue fighting?
Support for the conflict had never been strong in Britain, where many sympathized with the rebels, but now it reached a new low.
Although King George III personally wanted to fight on, his supporters lost control of Parliament, and no further major land offensives were launched in the American Theater.Washington could not know that after Yorktown the British would not reopen hostilities.
They still had 26,000 troops occupying New York City, Charleston and Savannah, together with a powerful fleet.
The French army and navy departed, so the Americans were on their own in 1782–83.
The treasury was empty, and the unpaid soldiers were growing restive, almost to the point of mutiny or possible "coup d'état".
The unrest among officers of the Newburgh Conspiracy was personally dispelled by Washington in 1783, and Congress subsequently created the promise of a five years bonus for all officers.
What doctrine did Luther and Zwingli disagree on and what was their disagreement?
Reformation outside Germany.Switzerland.Zwingli.Parallel to events in Germany, a movement began in the Swiss Confederation under the leadership of Huldrych Zwingli.
Zwingli was a scholar and preacher who moved to Zurich – the then-leading city state – in 1518, a year after Martin Luther began the Reformation in Germany with his 95 Theses.
Although the two movements agreed on many issues of theology, as the recently introduced printing press spread ideas rapidly from place to place, some unresolved differences kept them separate.
A long-standing resentment between the German states and the Swiss Confederation led to heated debate over how much Zwingli owed his ideas to Lutheranism.
Although Zwinglianism does hold uncanny resemblance to Lutheranism (it even had its own equivalent of the 95 Theses, called the 67 Conclusions), historians have been unable to prove that Zwingli had any contact with Luther's publications before 1520, and Zwingli himself maintained that he had prevented himself from reading them.
The German Prince Philip of Hesse saw potential in creating an alliance between Zwingli and Luther, seeing strength in a united Protestant front.
A meeting was held in his castle in 1529, now known as the Colloquy of Marburg, which has become infamous for its complete failure.
The two men could not come to any agreement due to their disputation over one key doctrine.
Although Luther preached consubstantiation in the Eucharist over transubstantiation, he believed in the spiritual presence of Christ at the mass.
Zwingli believed that the mass was only representative and memorial – Christ was not present.
Luther became so angry that he famously carved into the meeting table 'Hoc Est Corpus Meum' – a Biblical quotation from the Last Supper meaning 'this is my body'.
Some followers of Zwingli believed that the Reformation was too conservative, and moved independently toward more radical positions, some of which survive among modern day Anabaptists.
One famous incident illustrating this was when radical Zwinglians fried and ate sausages during Lent in Zurich city square by way of protest against the Church teaching of good works.
Other Protestant movements grew up along lines of mysticism or humanism (cf.
Erasmus), sometimes breaking from Rome or from the Protestants, or forming outside of the churches.
What kind of costumes were the men wearing?
While Samuel Adams tried to reassert control of the meeting, people poured out of the Old South Meeting House headed out to prepare to take action.
In some cases, this involved donning what may have been elaborately prepared Mohawk costumes.
While disguising their individual faces was imperative, because of the illegality of their protest, dressing as Mohawk warriors was a very specific and symbolic choice.
It showed that the Sons of Liberty identified with America, over their official status as subjects of Great Britain.That evening, a group of 30 to 130 men, some dressed in the Mohawk warrior disguises, boarded the three vessels and, over the course of three hours, dumped all 342 chests of tea into the water.
The precise location of the Griffin's Wharf site of the Tea Party has been subject to prolonged uncertainty; a comprehensive study places it near the foot of Hutchinson Street (today's Pearl Street).
The attackers supposedly followed whom?
The rapid industrialisation of the English economy cost many craft workers their jobs.
The movement started first with lace and hosiery workers near Nottingham and spread to other areas of the textile industry owing to early industrialisation.
Many weavers also found themselves suddenly unemployed since they could no longer compete with machines which only required relatively limited (and unskilled) labour to produce more cloth than a single weaver.
Many such unemployed workers, weavers and others, turned their animosity towards the machines that had taken their jobs and began destroying factories and machinery.
These attackers became known as Luddites, supposedly followers of Ned Ludd, a folklore figure.
The first attacks of the Luddite movement began in 1811.
The Luddites rapidly gained popularity, and the British government took drastic measures, using the militia or army to protect industry.
Those rioters who were caught were tried and hanged, or transported for life.Unrest continued in other sectors as they industrialised as well, such as with agricultural labourers in the 1830s when large parts of southern Britain were affected by the Captain Swing disturbances.
Threshing machines were a particular target, and hayrick burning was a popular activity.
However, the riots led to the first formation of trade unions, and further pressure for reform.
What year was Russia's financial crisis?
Other economic downturns have been called a "great depression", but none had been as widespread, or lasted for so long.
Various nations have experienced brief or extended periods of economic downturns, which were referred to as "depressions", but none have had such a widespread global impact.The collapse of the Soviet Union, and the breakdown of economic ties which followed, led to a severe economic crisis and catastrophic fall in the standards of living in the 1990s in post-Soviet states and the former Eastern Bloc, which was even worse than the Great Depression.
Even before Russia's financial crisis of 1998, Russia's GDP was half of what it had been in the early 1990s, and some populations are still poorer than they were in 1989, including Ukraine, Moldova, Central Asia, and the Caucasus.
What was the event that launched the "Space Race"?
The period after 1956 was marked by serious setbacks for the Soviet Union, most notably the breakdown of the Sino-Soviet alliance, beginning the Sino-Soviet split.
Mao had defended Stalin when Khrushchev attacked him after his death in 1956, and treated the new Soviet leader as a superficial upstart, accusing him of having lost his revolutionary edge.
For his part, Khrushchev, disturbed by Mao's glib attitude toward nuclear war, referred to the Chinese leader as a "lunatic on a throne".After this, Khrushchev made many desperate attempts to reconstitute the Sino-Soviet alliance, but Mao considered it useless and denied any proposal.
The Chinese-Soviet animosity spilled out in an intra-communist propaganda war.
Further on, the Soviets focused on a bitter rivalry with Mao's China for leadership of the global communist movement.On the nuclear weapons front, the United States and the USSR pursued nuclear rearmament and developed long-range weapons with which they could strike the territory of the other.
In August 1957, the Soviets successfully launched the world's first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and in October, launched the first Earth satellite, Sputnik.
The launch of Sputnik inaugurated the Space Race.
This culminated in the Apollo Moon landings, which astronaut Frank Borman later described as "just a battle in the Cold War."
Which law gave Hitler his dictatorial powers?
German communists, socialists and trade unionists were among the earliest domestic opponents of Nazism and were also among the first to be sent to concentration camps.
Hitler claimed that communism was a Jewish ideology which the Nazis termed "Judeo-Bolshevism".
Fear of communist agitation was used as justification for the Enabling Act of 1933, the law which gave Hitler his original dictatorial powers.
Hermann Göring later testified at the Nuremberg Trials that the Nazis' willingness to repress German communists prompted president Paul von Hindenburg and the German elite to cooperate with the Nazis.
MI6 assisted the Gestapo via "the exchange of information about Communism", and, as late as October 1937, the head of the British agency's Berlin station, Frank Foley, described his relationship with Heinrich Müller's so-called communism expert as "cordial".Hitler and the Nazis also hated German leftists because of their resistance to the party's racism.
Many leaders of German leftist groups were Jews, and Jews were especially prominent among the leaders of the Spartacist uprising in 1919.
Hitler already referred to Marxism and "Bolshevism" as a means of "the international Jew" to undermine "racial purity" and survival of the Nordics or Aryans, as well as to stir up socioeconomic class tension and labor unions against the government or state-owned businesses.
Within the concentration camps such as Buchenwald, German communists were privileged in comparison to Jews because of their "racial purity".Whenever the Nazis occupied a new territory, members of communist, socialist, or anarchist groups were normally to be the first persons detained or executed.
Evidence of this is found in Hitler's infamous Commissar Order, in which he ordered the summary execution of all political commissars captured among Soviet soldiers, as well as the execution of all Communist Party members in German-held territory.
"Einsatzgruppen" carried out these executions in the east.Nacht und Nebel ("Night and Fog") was a directive () of Hitler on 7 December 1941 signed and implemented by Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces Wilhelm Keitel, resulting in kidnapping and the disappearance of many political activists throughout Nazi Germany's occupied territories.
Where was World War 1 fought?
Background.World War I.The First World War (1914–1918) was fought across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia.
Countries beyond the war zones were also affected by the disruption of international trade, finance and diplomatic pressures from the belligerents.
In 1917, two revolutions occurred within the Russian Empire, which led to the collapse of the Imperial Government and the rise of the Bolshevik Party led by Vladimir Lenin.
How many cases of thyroid cancer were reported in 2005?
The 2005 Chernobyl Forum report revealed thyroid cancer among children to be one of the main health impacts from the Chernobyl accident.
In that publication more than 4000 cases were reported, and that there was no evidence of an increase in solid cancers or leukemia.
It said that there was an increase in psychological problems among the affected population.
Dr Michael Repacholi, manager of WHO's Radiation Program reported that the 4000 cases of thyroid cancer resulted in nine deaths.According to UNSCEAR, up to the year 2005, an excess of over 6000 cases of thyroid cancer have been reported.
That is, over the estimated pre-accident baseline thyroid cancer rate, more than 6000 casual cases of thyroid cancer have been reported in children and adolescents exposed at the time of the accident, a number that is expected to increase.
They concluded that there is no other evidence of major health impacts from the radiation exposure.Well-differentiated thyroid cancers are generally treatable, and when treated the five-year survival rate of thyroid cancer is 96%, and 92% after 30 years.
UNSCEAR had reported 15 deaths from thyroid cancer in 2011.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) also states that there has been no increase in the rate of birth defects or abnormalities, or solid cancers (such as lung cancer) corroborating UNSCEAR's assessments.
UNSCEAR does raise the possibility of long term genetic defects, pointing to a doubling of radiation-induced minisatellite mutations among children born in 1994.
However, the risk of thyroid cancer associated with the Chernobyl accident is still high according to published studies.The German affiliate of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW) argued that more than 10,000 people are today affected by thyroid cancer and 50,000 cases are expected in the future.
When did was the Armistice Agreement signed, ending the fighting in the Korean War?
Armistice (July 1953 – November 1954).The on-again, off-again armistice negotiations continued for two years, first at Kaesong (southern North Korea), then relocated at Panmunjom (bordering the Koreas).
A major, problematic negotiation point was prisoner of war (POW) repatriation.
The PVA, KPA, and UN Command could not agree on a system of repatriation because many PVA and KPA soldiers refused to be repatriated back to the north, which was unacceptable to the Chinese and North Koreans.
In the final armistice agreement, signed on 27 July 1953, a Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission was set up to handle the matter.In 1952, the US elected a new president, and on 29 November 1952, the president-elect, Dwight D. Eisenhower, went to Korea to learn what might end the Korean War.
With the United Nations' acceptance of India's proposed Korean War armistice, the KPA, the PVA, and the UN Command ceased fire with the battle line approximately at the 38th parallel.
Upon agreeing to the armistice, the belligerents established the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which has since been patrolled by the KPA and ROKA, US, and Joint UN Commands.The Demilitarized Zone runs northeast of the 38th parallel; to the south, it travels west.
The old Korean capital city of Kaesong, site of the armistice negotiations, originally lay in the pre-war ROK, but now is in the DPRK.
The United Nations Command, supported by the United States, the North Korean People's Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteers, signed the Armistice Agreement on 27 July 1953 to end the fighting.
The Armistice also called upon the governments of South Korea, North Korea, China and the United States to participate in continued peace talks.
The war is considered to have ended at this point, even though there was no peace treaty.
North Korea nevertheless claims that it won the Korean War.After the war, Operation Glory (July–November 1954) was conducted to allow combatant countries to exchange their dead.
The remains of 4,167 US Army and US Marine Corps dead were exchanged for 13,528 KPA and PVA dead, and 546 civilians dead in UN prisoner-of-war camps were delivered to the ROK government.
After Operation Glory, 416 Korean War unknown soldiers were buried in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific (The Punchbowl), on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.
Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office (DPMO) records indicate that the PRC and the DPRK transmitted 1,394 names, of which 858 were correct.
From 4,167 containers of returned remains, forensic examination identified 4,219 individuals.
Of these, 2,944 were identified as American, and all but 416 were identified by name.
From 1996 to 2006, the DPRK recovered 220 remains near the Sino-Korean border.
What became the basis of early American and Soviet rocket designs after WWII?
Origins.World War II.The Space Race can trace its origins to Germany, beginning in the 1930s and continuing during World War II when Nazi Germany researched and built operational ballistic missiles.
Starting in the early 1930s, during the last stages of the Weimar Republic, German aerospace engineers experimented with liquid-fueled rockets, with the goal that one day they would be capable of reaching high altitudes and traversing long distances.
The head of the German Army's Ballistics and Munitions Branch, Lieutenant Colonel Karl Emil Becker, gathered a small team of engineers that included Walter Dornberger and Leo Zanssen, to figure out how to use rockets as long-range artillery in order to get around the Treaty of Versailles' ban on research and development of long-range cannons.
Wernher von Braun, a young engineering prodigy, was recruited by Becker and Dornberger to join their secret army program at Kummersdorf-West in 1932.
Von Braun had dreams about conquering outer space with rockets, and did not initially see the military value in missile technology.During the Second World War, General Dornberger was the military head of the army's rocket program, Zanssen became the commandant of the Peenemünde army rocket centre, and von Braun was the technical director of the ballistic missile program.
They would lead the team that built the Aggregate-4 (A-4) rocket, which became the first vehicle to reach outer space during its test flight program in 1942 and 1943.
By 1943, Germany began mass-producing the A-4 as the Vergeltungswaffe 2 ("Vengeance Weapon" 2, or more commonly, V2), a ballistic missile with a range carrying a warhead at .
Its supersonic speed meant there was no defense against it, and radar detection provided little warning.
Germany used the weapon to bombard southern England and parts of Allied-liberated western Europe from 1944 until 1945.
After the war, the V-2 became the basis of early American and Soviet rocket designs.At war's end, American, British, and Soviet scientific intelligence teams competed to capture Germany's rocket engineers along with the German rockets themselves and the designs on which they were based.
Each of the Allies captured a share of the available members of the German rocket team, but the United States benefited the most with Operation Paperclip, recruiting von Braun and most of his engineering team, who later helped develop the American missile and space exploration programs.
The United States also acquired a large number of complete V2 rockets.
How many kilobytes of data was the group able to encode?
In a paper published in Nature in January, 2013, scientists from the European Bioinformatics Institute and Agilent Technologies proposed a mechanism to use DNA's ability to code information as a means of digital data storage.
The group was able to encode 739 kilobytes of data into DNA code, synthesize the actual DNA, then sequence the DNA and decode the information back to its original form, with a reported 100% accuracy.
The encoded information consisted of text files and audio files.
A prior experiment was published in August 2012.
It was conducted by researchers at Harvard University, where the text of a 54,000-word book was encoded in DNA.
What is considered one of the most sensitive indicators of climate change?
Glaciers are considered among the most sensitive indicators of climate change.
Their size is determined by a mass balance between snow input and melt output.
As temperatures warm, glaciers retreat unless snow precipitation increases to make up for the additional melt; the converse is also true.Glaciers grow and shrink due both to natural variability and external forcings.
Variability in temperature, precipitation, and englacial and subglacial hydrology can strongly determine the evolution of a glacier in a particular season.
Therefore, one must average over a decadal or longer time-scale and/or over a many individual glaciers to smooth out the local short-term variability and obtain a glacier history that is related to climate.A world glacier inventory has been compiled since the 1970s, initially based mainly on aerial photographs and maps but now relying more on satellites.
This compilation tracks more than 100,000 glaciers covering a total area of approximately 240,000 km2, and preliminary estimates indicate that the remaining ice cover is around 445,000 km2.
The World Glacier Monitoring Service collects data annually on glacier retreat and glacier mass balance.
From this data, glaciers worldwide have been found to be shrinking significantly, with strong glacier retreats in the 1940s, stable or growing conditions during the 1920s and 1970s, and again retreating from the mid-1980s to present.The most significant climate processes since the middle to late Pliocene (approximately 3 million years ago) are the glacial and interglacial cycles.
The present interglacial period (the Holocene) has lasted about 11,700 years.
Shaped by orbital variations, responses such as the rise and fall of continental ice sheets and significant sea-level changes helped create the climate.
Other changes, including Heinrich events, Dansgaard–Oeschger events and the Younger Dryas, however, illustrate how glacial variations may also influence climate without the orbital forcing.Glaciers leave behind moraines that contain a wealth of material—including organic matter, quartz, and potassium that may be dated—recording the periods in which a glacier advanced and retreated.
Similarly, by tephrochronological techniques, the lack of glacier cover can be identified by the presence of soil or volcanic tephra horizons whose date of deposit may also be ascertained.
What can adult stem cells be used for?
Adult stem cells, also called somatic (from Greek Σωματικóς, "of the body") stem cells, are stem cells which maintain and repair the tissue in which they are found.
They can be found in children, as well as adults.Pluripotent adult stem cells are rare and generally small in number, but they can be found in umbilical cord blood and other tissues.
Bone marrow is a rich source of adult stem cells, which have been used in treating several conditions including spinal cord injury, liver cirrhosis, chronic limb ischemia and endstage heart failure.
The quantity of bone marrow stem cells declines with age and is greater in males than females during reproductive years.
Much adult stem cell research to date has aimed to characterize their potency and self-renewal capabilities.
In mice, pluripotent stem cells are directly generated from adult fibroblast cultures.
However, mice do not live long with stem cell organs.Most adult stem cells are lineage-restricted (multipotent) and are generally referred to by their tissue origin (mesenchymal stem cell, adipose-derived stem cell, endothelial stem cell, dental pulp stem cell, etc.
).Adult stem cell treatments have been successfully used for many years to treat leukemia and related bone/blood cancers through bone marrow transplants.
Adult stem cells are also used in veterinary medicine to treat tendon and ligament injuries in horses.The use of adult stem cells in research and therapy is not as controversial as the use of embryonic stem cells, because the production of adult stem cells does not require the destruction of an embryo.
Additionally, in instances where adult stem cells are obtained from the intended recipient (an autograft), the risk of rejection is essentially non-existent.
Consequently, more US government funding is being provided for adult stem cell research.
How many cellular organisms are needed for cloning?
Cell cloning.Cloning unicellular organisms.Cloning a cell means to derive a population of cells from a single cell.
In the case of unicellular organisms such as bacteria and yeast, this process is remarkably simple and essentially only requires the inoculation of the appropriate medium.
However, in the case of cell cultures from multi-cellular organisms, cell cloning is an arduous task as these cells will not readily grow in standard media.A useful tissue culture technique used to clone distinct lineages of cell lines involves the use of cloning rings (cylinders).
According to this technique, a single-cell suspension of cells that have been exposed to a mutagenic agent or drug used to drive selection is plated at high dilution to create isolated colonies; each arising from a single and potentially clonal distinct cell.
At an early growth stage when colonies consist of only a few of cells, sterile polystyrene rings (cloning rings), which have been dipped in grease are placed over an individual colony and a small amount of trypsin is added.
Cloned cells are collected from inside the ring and transferred to a new vessel for further growth.
What is depletion of the ozone layer caused by?
Since 1978, output from the Sun has been precisely measured by satellites.
These measurements indicate that the Sun's output has not increased since 1978, so the warming during the past 30 years cannot be attributed to an increase in solar energy reaching the Earth.Climate models have been used to examine the role of the sun in recent climate change.
Models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when they only take into account variations in solar output and volcanic activity.
Models are, however, able to simulate the observed 20th century changes in temperature when they include all of the most important external forcings, including human influences and natural forcings.Another line of evidence against the sun having caused recent climate change comes from looking at how temperatures at different levels in the Earth's atmosphere have changed.
Models and observations show that greenhouse warming results in warming of the lower atmosphere (called the troposphere) but cooling of the upper atmosphere (called the stratosphere).
Depletion of the ozone layer by chemical refrigerants has also resulted in a strong cooling effect in the stratosphere.
If the sun were responsible for observed warming, warming of both the troposphere and stratosphere would be expected.
Who expected the eighth period on the periodic table to follow previously established patterns?
It is unclear whether new elements will continue the pattern of the current periodic table as period 8, or require further adaptations or adjustments.
Seaborg expected the eighth period to follow the previously established pattern exactly, so that it would include a two-element s-block for elements 119 and 120, a new g-block for the next 18 elements, and 30 additional elements continuing the current f-, d-, and p-blocks.
More recently, physicists such as Pekka Pyykkö have theorized that these additional elements do not follow the Madelung rule, which predicts how electron shells are filled and thus affects the appearance of the present periodic table.
What is a general term for physics research which is intended for a particular use.
Applied physics is a general term for physics research which is intended for a particular use.
An applied physics curriculum usually contains a few classes in an applied discipline, like geology or electrical engineering.
It usually differs from engineering in that an applied physicist may not be designing something in particular, but rather is using physics or conducting physics research with the aim of developing new technologies or solving a problem.The approach is similar to that of applied mathematics.
Applied physicists can also be interested in the use of physics for scientific research.
For instance, people working on accelerator physics might seek to build better particle detectors for research in theoretical physics.Physics is used heavily in engineering.
For example, statics, a subfield of mechanics, is used in the building of bridges and other static structures.
The understanding and use of acoustics results in sound control and better concert halls; similarly, the use of optics creates better optical devices.
An understanding of physics makes for more realistic flight simulators, video games, and movies, and is often critical in forensic investigations.With the standard consensus that the laws of physics are universal and do not change with time, physics can be used to study things that would ordinarily be mired in uncertainty.
For example, in the study of the origin of the earth, one can reasonably model earth's mass, temperature, and rate of rotation, as a function of time allowing one to extrapolate forward and backward in time and so predict prior and future conditions.
It also allows for simulations in engineering which drastically speed up the development of a new technology.But there is also considerable interdisciplinarity in the physicist's methods and so many other important fields are influenced by physics, e.g.
the fields of econophysics and sociophysics.
What are views on how sex evolved?
Despite the profound advances made over recent decades in our understanding of life’s fundamental processes, some basic problems have remained unresolved.
For example, one of the major unresolved problems in biology is the primary adaptive function of sex, and particularly its key processes in eukaryotes, meiosis and homologous recombination.
One view is that sex evolved primarily as an adaptation for increasing genetic diversity (see references e.g.).
An alternative view is that sex is an adaptation for promoting accurate DNA repair in germ-line DNA, and that increased genetic diversity is primarily a byproduct that may be useful in the long run.
(See also Evolution of sexual reproduction).Another basic unresolved problem in biology is the biologic basis of aging.
At present, there is no consensus view on the underlying cause of aging.
Various competing theories are outlined in Ageing#Theories.
What did the Mexican Tetra lose during it's evolution?
Concepts and models used in evolutionary biology, such as natural selection, have many applications.Artificial selection is the intentional selection of traits in a population of organisms.
This has been used for thousands of years in the domestication of plants and animals.
More recently, such selection has become a vital part of genetic engineering, with selectable markers such as antibiotic resistance genes being used to manipulate DNA.
Proteins with valuable properties have evolved by repeated rounds of mutation and selection (for example modified enzymes and new antibodies) in a process called directed evolution.Understanding the changes that have occurred during organism's evolution can reveal the genes needed to construct parts of the body, genes which may be involved in human genetic disorders.
For example, the mexican tetra is an albino cavefish that lost its eyesight during evolution.
Breeding together different populations of this blind fish produced some offspring with functional eyes, since different mutations had occurred in the isolated populations that had evolved in different caves.
This helped identify genes required for vision and pigmentation.Many human diseases are not static phenomena, but capable of evolution.
Viruses, bacteria, fungi and cancers evolve to be resistant to host immune defences, as well as pharmaceutical drugs.
These same problems occur in agriculture with pesticide and herbicide resistance.
It is possible that we are facing the end of the effective life of most of available antibiotics and predicting the evolution and evolvability of our pathogens and devising strategies to slow or circumvent it is requiring deeper knowledge of the complex forces driving evolution at the molecular level.In computer science, simulations of evolution using evolutionary algorithms and artificial life started in the 1960s and was extended with simulation of artificial selection.
Artificial evolution became a widely recognised optimisation method as a result of the work of Ingo Rechenberg in the 1960s.
He used evolution strategies to solve complex engineering problems.
Genetic algorithms in particular became popular through the writing of John Holland.
Practical applications also include automatic evolution of computer programmes.
Evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multi-dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers and also to optimise the design of systems.
Describe the anatomy of an insect
Insects possess segmented bodies supported by a hard-jointed outer covering made mostly of chitin.
The segments of the body are organized into three distinct parts, a head, a thorax and an abdomen.
The head typically bears a pair of sensory antennae, a pair of compound eyes, one to three simple eyes (ocelli) and three sets of modified appendages that form the mouthparts.
The thorax has three pairs of segmented legs, one pair each for the three segments that compose the thorax and one or two pairs of wings.
The abdomen is composed of eleven segments, some of which may be fused and houses the digestive, respiratory, excretory and reproductive systems.
There is considerable variations between species and many adaptations to the body parts, especially wings, legs, antennae and mouthparts.
What are arguments against astrology?
Cicero stated the twins objection (that with close birth times, personal outcomes can be very different), later developed by Saint Augustine.
He argued that since the other planets are much more distant from the earth than the moon, they could have only very tiny influence compared to the moon's.
He also argued that if astrology explains everything about a person's fate, then it wrongly ignores the visible effect of inherited ability and parenting, changes in health worked by medicine, or the effects of the weather on people.Plotinus argued that since the fixed stars are much more distant than the planets, it is laughable to imagine the planets' effect on mankind should depend on their position with respect to the zodiac.
He also argues that the interpretation of the moon's conjunction with a planet as good when the moon is full, but bad when the moon is waning, is clearly wrong, as from the moon's point of view, half of her surface is always in sunlight; and from the planet's point of view, waning should be better, as then the planet sees some light from the moon, but when the moon is full to us, it is dark, and therefore bad, on the side facing the planet.Favorinus argued that it was absurd to imagine that stars and planets would affect human bodies in the same way as they affect the tides, and equally absurd that small motions in the heavens cause large changes in people's fates.
Sextus Empiricus argued that it was absurd to link human attributes with myths about the signs of the zodiac.
Carneades argued that belief in fate denies free will and morality; that people born at different times can all die in the same accident or battle; and that contrary to uniform influences from the stars, tribes and cultures are all different.
What is the largest and desest of the inner planets?
 Earth (1 AU from the Sun) is the largest and densest of the inner planets, the only one known to have current geological activity, and the only place where life is known to exist.
Its liquid hydrosphere is unique among the terrestrial planets, and it is the only planet where plate tectonics has been observed.
Earth's atmosphere is radically different from those of the other planets, having been altered by the presence of life to contain 21% free oxygen.
It has one natural satellite, the Moon, the only large satellite of a terrestrial planet in the Solar System.
What has been the largest number of people on the ISS at once?
International Space Station (1993–present).The International Space Station (ISS) combines NASA's "Space Station Freedom" project with the Soviet/Russian "Mir-2" station, the European "Columbus" station, and the Japanese Kibō laboratory module.
NASA originally planned in the 1980s to develop "Freedom" alone, but US budget constraints led to the merger of these projects into a single multi-national program in 1993, managed by NASA, the Russian Federal Space Agency (RKA), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA).
The station consists of pressurized modules, external trusses, solar arrays and other components, which have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and the US Space Shuttles.
It is currently being assembled in Low Earth Orbit.
The on-orbit assembly began in 1998, the completion of the US Orbital Segment occurred in 2011 and the completion of the Russian Orbital Segment is expected by 2016.
The ownership and use of the space station is established in intergovernmental treaties and agreements which divide the station into two areas and allow Russia to retain full ownership of the Russian Orbital Segment (with the exception of Zarya), with the US Orbital Segment allocated between the other international partners.Long duration missions to the ISS are referred to as ISS Expeditions.
Expedition crew members typically spend approximately six months on the ISS.
The initial expedition crew size was three, temporarily decreased to two following the Columbia disaster.
Since May 2009, expedition crew size has been six crew members.
Crew size is expected to be increased to seven, the number the ISS was designed for, once the Commercial Crew Program becomes operational.
The ISS has been continuously occupied for the past , having exceeded the previous record held by Mir; and has been visited by astronauts and cosmonauts from 15 different nations.The station can be seen from the Earth with the naked eye and, , is the largest artificial satellite in Earth orbit with a mass and volume greater than that of any previous space station.
The Soyuz spacecraft delivers crew members, stays docked for their half-year long missions and then returns them home.
Several uncrewed cargo spacecraft service the ISS, they are the Russian Progress spacecraft which has done so since 2000, the European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) since 2008, the Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) since 2009, the American Dragon spacecraft since 2012 and the American Cygnus spacecraft since 2013.
The Space Shuttle, before its retirement, was also used for cargo transfer and would often switch out expedition crew members, although it did not have the capability to remain docked for the duration of their stay.
Until another US manned spacecraft is ready, crew members will travel to and from the International Space Station exclusively aboard the Soyuz.
The highest number of people occupying the ISS has been thirteen; this occurred three times during the late Shuttle ISS assembly missions.The ISS program is expected to continue until at least 2020 but may be extended until 2028 or possibly beyond that.
Where are RNA Nucleotides found?
Many RNAs are involved in modifying other RNAs.Introns are spliced out of pre-mRNA by spliceosomes, which contain several small nuclear RNAs (snRNA), or the introns can be ribozymes that are spliced by themselves.RNA can also be altered by having its nucleotides modified to other nucleotides than A, C, G and U.In eukaryotes, modifications of RNA nucleotides are in general directed by small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA; 60-300 nt), found in the nucleolus and cajal bodies.
snoRNAs associate with enzymes and guide them to a spot on an RNA by basepairing to that RNA.
These enzymes then perform the nucleotide modification.
rRNAs and tRNAs are extensively modified, but snRNAs and mRNAs can also be the target of base modification.
RNA can also be methylated.
When giving live vaccines, who is most endangered by them?
Vaccination is a cheap and effective way of preventing infections by viruses.
Vaccines were used to prevent viral infections long before the discovery of the actual viruses.
Their use has resulted in a dramatic decline in morbidity (illness) and mortality (death) associated with viral infections such as polio, measles, mumps and rubella.
Smallpox infections have been eradicated.
Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of humans, and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals.
Vaccines can consist of live-attenuated or killed viruses, or viral proteins (antigens).
Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus, which do not cause the disease but, nonetheless, confer immunity.
Such viruses are called attenuated.
Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity, (who are described as immunocompromised), because in these people, the weakened virus can cause the original disease.
Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines.
These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus.
Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine.
Subunit vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they cannot cause the disease.The yellow fever virus vaccine, a live-attenuated strain called 17D, is probably the safest and most effective vaccine ever generated.
Who were the ancestors of unicellular microorganisms?
The ancestors of modern bacteria were unicellular microorganisms that were the first forms of life to appear on Earth, about 4 billion years ago.
For about 3 billion years, all organisms were microscopic, and bacteria and archaea were the dominant forms of life.
Although bacterial fossils exist, such as stromatolites, their lack of distinctive morphology prevents them from being used to examine the history of bacterial evolution, or to date the time of origin of a particular bacterial species.
However, gene sequences can be used to reconstruct the bacterial phylogeny, and these studies indicate that bacteria diverged first from the archaeal/eukaryotic lineage.
Bacteria were also involved in the second great evolutionary divergence, that of the archaea and eukaryotes.
Here, eukaryotes resulted from the entering of ancient bacteria into endosymbiotic associations with the ancestors of eukaryotic cells, which were themselves possibly related to the Archaea.
This involved the engulfment by proto-eukaryotic cells of alpha-proteobacterial symbionts to form either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes, which are still found in all known Eukarya (sometimes in highly reduced form, e.g.
in ancient "amitochondrial" protozoa).
Later on, some eukaryotes that already contained mitochondria also engulfed cyanobacterial-like organisms.
This led to the formation of chloroplasts in algae and plants.
There are also some algae that originated from even later endosymbiotic events.
Here, eukaryotes engulfed a eukaryotic algae that developed into a "second-generation" plastid.
This is known as secondary endosymbiosis.
Are yeasts able to grown food with low PH?
Yeasts are able to grow in foods with a low pH (5.0 or lower) and in the presence of sugars, organic acids, and other easily metabolized carbon sources.
During their growth, yeasts metabolize some food components and produce metabolic end products.
This causes the physical, chemical, and sensible properties of a food to change, and the food is spoiled.
The growth of yeast within food products is often seen on their surfaces, as in cheeses or meats, or by the fermentation of sugars in beverages, such as juices, and semiliquid products, such as syrups and jams.
The yeast of the "Zygosaccharomyces" genus have had a long history as spoilage yeasts within the food industry.
This is mainly because these species can grow in the presence of high sucrose,ethanol, acetic acid, sorbic acid, benzoic acid, and sulphur dioxide concentrations, representing some of the commonly used food preservation methods.
Methylene blue is used to test for the presence of live yeast cells.
In oenology, the major spoilage yeast is "Dekkera bruxellensis ".
What is the science of investigating small objects?
A microscope (from the , "mikrós", "small" and , "skopeîn", "to look" or "see") is an instrument used to see objects that are too small for the naked eye.
The science of investigating small objects using such an instrument is called microscopy.
Microscopic means invisible to the eye unless aided by a microscope.There are many types of microscopes, the most common and first to be invented is the optical microscope which uses light to image the sample.
Other major types of microscopes are the electron microscope (both the transmission electron microscope and the scanning electron microscope) and the various types of scanning probe microscope.
What does a telescope collect to aid in the observation of remote objects?
A telescope is an instrument that aids in the observation of remote objects by collecting electromagnetic radiation (such as visible light).
The first known practical telescopes were invented in the Netherlands at the beginning of the 17th century, using glass lenses.
They found use in terrestrial applications and astronomy.Within a few decades, the reflecting telescope was invented, which used mirrors.
In the 20th century many new types of telescopes were invented, including radio telescopes in the 1930s and infrared telescopes in the 1960s.
The word "telescope" now refers to a wide range of instruments detecting different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and in some cases other types of detectors.The word ""telescope"" (from the Greek τῆλε, "tele" "far" and σκοπεῖν, "skopein" "to look or see"; τηλεσκόπος, "teleskopos" "far-seeing") was coined in 1611 by the Greek mathematician Giovanni Demisiani for one of Galileo Galilei's instruments presented at a banquet at the Accademia dei Lincei.
In the "Starry Messenger", Galileo had used the term "perspicillum".
To black holes emit Hawking radiation?
Because a black hole has only a few internal parameters, most of the information about the matter that went into forming the black hole is lost.
Regardless of the type of matter which goes into a black hole, it appears that only information concerning the total mass, charge, and angular momentum are conserved.
As long as black holes were thought to persist forever this information loss is not that problematic, as the information can be thought of as existing inside the black hole, inaccessible from the outside.
However, black holes slowly evaporate by emitting Hawking radiation.
This radiation does not appear to carry any additional information about the matter that formed the black hole, meaning that this information appears to be gone forever.The question whether information is truly lost in black holes (the black hole information paradox) has divided the theoretical physics community (see Thorne–Hawking–Preskill bet).
In quantum mechanics, loss of information corresponds to the violation of vital property called unitarity, which has to do with the conservation of probability.
It has been argued that loss of unitarity would also imply violation of conservation of energy.
Over recent years evidence has been building that indeed information and unitarity are preserved in a full quantum gravitational treatment of the problem.
What does the star emit during the AGB phase?
A protoplanetary nebula (PPN) is an astronomical object which is at the short-lived episode during a star's rapid stellar evolution between the late asymptotic giant branch (LAGB) phase and the following planetary nebula (PN) phase.
During the AGB phase, the star undergoes mass loss, emitting a circumstellar shell of hydrogen gas.
When this phase comes to an end, the star enters the PPN phase.The PPN is energized by the central star, causing it to emit strong infrared radiation and become a reflection nebula.
Collaminated stellar winds from the central star shape and shock the shell into an axially symmetric form, while producing a fast moving molecular wind.
The exact point when a PPN becomes a planetary nebula (PN) is defined by the temperature of the central star.
The PPN phase continues until the central star reaches a temperature of 30,000 K, after which is it hot enough to ionize the surrounding gas.
Which planets have aurooras been observed on?
[[Image:Saturns Northern Aurora still.jpg|thumb|An aurora high above the northern part of Saturn; image taken by the Cassini spacecraft,a movie (click on image), shows images from 81 hours of observations of Saturn's aurora]]Both Jupiter and Saturn have magnetic fields much stronger than Earth's (Jupiter's equatorial field strength is 4.3 gauss, compared to 0.3 gauss for Earth), and both have large radiation belts.
Auroras have been observed on both, most clearly with the Hubble Space Telescope.
Uranus and Neptune have also been observed to have auroras.The auroras on the gas giants seem, like Earth's, to be powered by the solar wind.
In addition, however, Jupiter's moons, especially Io, are powerful sources of auroras on Jupiter.
These arise from electric currents along field lines ("field aligned currents"), generated by a dynamo mechanism due to the relative motion between the rotating planet and the moving moon.
Io, which has active volcanism and an ionosphere, is a particularly strong source, and its currents also generate radio emissions, studied since 1955.
Auroras also have been observed on the surfaces of Io, Europa, and Ganymede, using the Hubble Space Telescope.
These auroras have also been observed on Venus and Mars.
Because Venus has no intrinsic (planetary) magnetic field, Venusian auroras appear as bright and diffuse patches of varying shape and intensity, sometimes distributed across the full planetary disc.
Venusian auroras are produced by the impact of electrons originating from the solar wind and precipitating in the night-side atmosphere.
An aurora was also detected on Mars, on 14 August 2004, by the SPICAM instrument aboard Mars Express.
The aurora was located at Terra Cimmeria, in the region of 177° East, 52° South.
The total size of the emission region was about 30 km across, and possibly about 8 km high.
By analyzing a map of crustal magnetic anomalies compiled with data from Mars Global Surveyor, scientists observed that the region of the emissions corresponded to an area where the strongest magnetic field is localized.
This correlation indicates that the origin of the light emission was a flux of electrons moving along the crust magnetic lines and exciting the upper atmosphere of Mars.
Where does "Henry's Puffy Tacos" originate?
Since at least 1978, a variation called the "puffy taco" has been popular.
"Henry's Puffy Tacos", opened by Henry Lopez in San Antonio, Texas, claims to have invented the variation, in which uncooked corn tortillas (flattened balls of masa dough) are quickly fried in hot oil until they expand and become "puffy".
Fillings are similar to hard-shell versions.
Restaurants offering this style of taco have since appeared in other Texas cities, as well as in California, where Henry's brother, Arturo Lopez, opened "Arturo's Puffy Taco" in Whittier, not long after Henry's opened.
Henry's continues to thrive, managed by the family's second generation.Kits are available at grocery and convenience stores and usually consist of taco shells (corn tortillas already fried in a U-shape), seasoning mix and taco sauce.
Commercial vendors for the home market also market soft taco kits with tortillas instead of taco shells.The breakfast taco, found in Tex-Mex cuisine, is filled with meat, eggs, or cheese, with other ingredients.The tacodilla contains melted cheese in between the two folded tortillas, thus resembling a quesadilla.
Who invented the hamburger?
One of the earliest claims comes from Charlie Nagreen, who in 1885 sold a meatball between two slices of bread at the Seymour Fair now called theOutagamie County Fair in some attributions.
The Seymour Community Historical Society of Seymour, Wisconsin, credits Nagreen, now known as "Hamburger Charlie", with the invention of the hamburger.
Nagreen was fifteen when he reportedly made sandwiches out of pork that he was selling at the 1885 Seymour Fair (now the Outagamie County Fair), so that customers could eat while walking.
The Historical Society explains that Nagreen named the hamburger after the Hamburg steak with which local German immigrants were familiar.
What is the difference between fries and chips?
French fries (American English) or chips, fries, finger chips, or French-fried potatoes are batons of deep-fried potato.
Americans and most Canadians refer to any elongated pieces of fried potatoes as "fries", while in the United Kingdom, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand, long, thinly cut slices of fried potatoes are sometimes called "fries" to distinguish them from the more thickly cut strips called chips.French fries are served hot and generally eaten as an accompaniment with lunch or dinner, or eaten as a snack, and they are a common fixture of fast food.
French fries are generally salted and, in their simplest and most common form, are served with ketchup; in many countries, though, they are topped instead with other condiments or toppings, including vinegar, mayonnaise, or other local specialities.
Fries can also be topped more elaborately, as is the case with the dishes of poutine and chili cheese fries.
Sometimes, fries are made with sweet potatoes instead of potatoes, are baked instead of fried, or are cut into unusual shapes, as is the case with curly fries, wavy fries, or tornado fries.
Are there more then one variety of sausage?
There are many varieties of sausages known to Thai cuisine, some of which are specialities of a specific region of Thailand.
From northern Thailand comes "sai ua", a grilled minced pork sausage flavored with curry paste and fresh herbs.
Another grilled sausage is called "sai krok Isan", a fermented sausage with a distinctive slightly sour taste from northeastern Thailand (the region also known as Isan).
Both sausages are commonly eaten with sticky rice, fresh vegetables, and a fresh "nam phrik" (Thai chilli paste) or some raw bird's eye chilies.
They might also be served together with a refreshing Thai salad such as "som tum" (green papaya salad).Also very popular in Thailand is "naem", a raw fermented pork sausage similar to the Vietnamese "nem chua" and Laotian "som moo".
This variety of sausage is often encountered as "yam naem" and "naem khluk", both of which are Thai salads.
Adopted from Vietnam comes "mu yo".
It is somewhat similar in taste and texture to liverwurst and, served with a "nam chim" (Thai dipping sauce), a popular snack in Thailand.
It too can be used as an ingredient for Thai salads and as a meat ingredient in, for instance, Thai soups.
"Kun chiang" is a dry and sweet Chinese sausage which has also been incorporated into the Thai culinary culture.
Known as "lap cheong" by Cantonese, in Thailand it is most often used, again, as an ingredient for a Thai salad, "yam kun chiang", one that is normally only eaten together with "khao tom kui", a plain rice congee.
A host of modern, factory-made, sausages have become popular as snacks in recent years.
These most often resemble hot-dogs and frankfurters and are commonly sold grilled or deep-fried at street stalls, and served with a sweet, sticky and slightly spicy soy-based sauce.
When in the process of making bacon is it smoked?
First, pork bellies are sorted by size and fat percentage.
They are then placed into a large machine that rotates (often called a tumbler).
This softens the bellies, which makes it easier to remove the rinds.
The bellies are then cut, either manually or mechanically, to remove the skin from the meat.
The skins may be used to be processed into pork rinds.
The bacon is then treated by a brine solution.
The brine solution may contain the flavorings, or the flavorings may be added later.
After being brined, the bacon is smoked.
Depending on where the bacon is made, the smoking process is different.
The bacon is then cooked in an oven and soon after chilled for a few days.
The cooling makes the meat firm which makes it easier to slice.
After being cooled, the bacon is sliced into strips.
The bacon is then cooked.
The fat that cooks off the bacon is sometimes collected to be used for things like gravy and pet foods.
The bacon strips are then ready for consumption.
If the bacon is made for commercial use then the strips are packaged.
What is Adana kebabı?
Adana kebabı (or kıyma kebabı) is a long, hand-minced meat kebab mounted on a wide iron skewer and grilled over charcoal.
It is generally "hot" or piquant.
A "less hot" version is generally called urfa kebabı.
What type of shop does the widow have?
Use in motion pictures.
"Tampopo".The production and consumption of ramen was a large part of the 1985 Japanese comedy film "Tampopo" by director Juzo Itami.
Two truck drivers, Goro and Gun (Tsutomu Yamazaki and Ken Watanabe), help the widowed Tampopo (Nobuko Miyamoto) with her failing ramen shop.
Food in every aspect of life is the overarching theme, but the art of good ramen is touched upon several times throughout the film as Goro and Gun help her learn how to make the best ramen.
Is the taste of Udon regional?
Udon is often served hot as a noodle soup in its simplest form, as "kake udon", in a mildly flavoured broth called "kakejiru," which is made of dashi, soy sauce (shōyu), and mirin.
It is usually topped with thinly chopped scallions.
Other common toppings include tempura, often prawn or "kakiage" (a type of mixed tempura fritter), or "aburaage", a type of deep-fried tofu pockets seasoned with sugar, mirin, and soy sauce.
A thin slice of kamaboko, a halfmoon-shaped fish cake, is often added.
Shichimi can be added to taste.The flavor of broth and topping vary from region to region.
Usually, dark brown broth, made from dark soy sauce ("koikuchi shōyu"), is used in eastern Japan, and light brown broth, made from light soy sauce ("usukuchi shōyu"), is used in western Japan.
This is even noticeable in packaged instant noodles, which are often sold in two different versions for east and west.
What is unmilled rice known as?
Unmilled rice, known as paddy (Indonesia and Malaysia: padi; Philippines, palay), is usually harvested when the grains have a moisture content of around 25%.
In most Asian countries, where rice is almost entirely the product of smallholder agriculture, harvesting is carried out manually, although there is a growing interest in mechanical harvesting.
Harvesting can be carried out by the farmers themselves, but is also frequently done by seasonal labour groups.
Harvesting is followed by threshing, either immediately or within a day or two.
Again, much threshing is still carried out by hand but there is an increasing use of mechanical threshers.
Subsequently, paddy needs to be dried to bring down the moisture content to no more than 20% for milling.A familiar sight in several Asian countries is paddy laid out to dry along roads.
However, in most countries the bulk of drying of marketed paddy takes place in mills, with village-level drying being used for paddy to be consumed by farm families.
Mills either sun dry or use mechanical driers or both.
Drying has to be carried out quickly to avoid the formation of moulds.
Mills range from simple hullers, with a throughput of a couple of tonnes a day, that simply remove the outer husk, to enormous operations that can process 4,000 tonnes a day and produce highly polished rice.
A good mill can achieve a paddy-to-rice conversion rate of up to 72% but smaller, inefficient mills often struggle to achieve 60%.
These smaller mills often do not buy paddy and sell rice but only service farmers who want to mill their paddy for their own consumption.
How are the more tender cuts cooked?
The more tender cuts of beef, from the loin and rib, are cooked quickly, using dry heat, and served whole.
Less tender cuts from the chuck or round are cooked with moist heat or are mechanically tenderized ("e.g."
cube steak).Steak can be cooked to a level of very rare (bleu, a cold raw center), rare, medium rare, medium, medium well done, or well done.
Beef, unlike certain other meats, does not need to be cooked through.
Food-borne human illnesses are not normally found within a beef steak, though surfaces can potentially be contaminated from handling, and thus, very rare steak (seared on the outside and raw within) is generally accepted as safe.
What are some common raw vegetables used in salad?
Vegetables other than greens may be used in a salad.
Common raw vegetables used in a salad include cucumbers, peppers, tomatoes, onions, spring onions, red onions, carrots, celery, and radishes.
Other ingredients, such as mushrooms, avocado, olives, hard boiled egg, artichoke hearts, heart of palm, roasted red bell peppers, green beans, croutons, cheeses, meat (e.g.
bacon, chicken), or seafood (e.g.
tuna, shrimp), are sometimes added to salads.
What type of popcorns have long kernal points at both ends?
Popping results are sensitive to the rate at which the kernels are heated.
If heated too quickly, the steam in the outer layers of the kernel can reach high pressures and rupture the hull before the starch in the center of the kernel can fully gelatinize, leading to partially popped kernels with hard centers.
Heating too slowly leads to entirely unpopped kernels: the tip of the kernel, where it attached to the cob, is not entirely moisture-proof, and when heated slowly, the steam can leak out of the tip fast enough to keep the pressure from rising sufficiently to break the hull and cause the pop.Producers and sellers of popcorn consider two major factors in evaluating the quality of popcorn: what percentage of the kernels will pop, and how much each popped kernel expands.
Expansion is an important factor to both the consumer and vendor.
For the consumer, larger pieces of popcorn tend to be more tender and are associated with higher quality.
For the grower, distributor, and vendor, expansion is closely correlated with profit: vendors such as theaters buy popcorn by weight and sell it by volume.
For both these reasons, higher-expansion popcorn fetches a higher profit per unit weight.Popcorn will pop when freshly harvested, but not well: its high moisture content leads to poor expansion and chewy pieces of popcorn.
Kernels with a high moisture content are also susceptible to mold when stored.
For these reasons, popcorn growers and distributors dry the kernels until they reach the moisture level at which they expand the most.
This differs by variety and conditions, but is generally in the range of 14–15% moisture by weight.
If the kernels are over-dried, the expansion rate will suffer and the percentage of kernels that pop at all will decline.When the popcorn has finished popping, sometimes unpopped kernels remain.
Known in the popcorn industry as "old maids", the kernels don't pop because they do not have enough moisture to create enough steam for an explosion.
Rehydrating prior to popping usually results in eliminating the unpopped kernels.Popcorn varieties are broadly categorized by the shape of the kernels, the color of the kernels, or the shape of the popped corn.
While the kernels may come in a variety of colors, the popped corn is always off-yellow or white as it is only the hull (or pericarp) that is colored.
"Rice" type popcorns have a long kernel pointed at both ends; "pearl" type kernels are rounded at the top.
Commercial popcorn production has moved mostly to pearl types.
Historically, pearl popcorns were usually yellow and rice popcorns usually white.
Today both shapes are available in both colors, as well as others including black, red, and variegated.
Commercial production is dominated by white and yellow.
What are the oldest forms of cake
Cake is a form of bread or bread-like food.
In its modern forms, it is typically a sweet baked dessert.
In its oldest forms, cakes were normally fried breads or cheesecakes, and normally had a disk shape.
Determining whether a given food should be classified as bread, cake, or pastry can be difficult.Modern cake, especially layer cakes, normally contain a combination of flour, sugar, eggs, and butter or oil, with some varieties also requiring liquid (typically milk or water) and leavening agents (such as yeast or baking powder).
Flavorful ingredients like fruit purées, nuts, dried or candied fruit, or extracts are often added, and numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients are possible.
Cakes are often filled with fruit preserves or dessert sauces (like pastry cream), iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped borders or candied fruit.Cake is often the dessert of choice for meals at ceremonial occasions, particularly weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays.
There are countless cake recipes; some are bread-like, some rich and elaborate, and many are centuries old.
Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure; while at one time considerable labor went into cake making (particularly the whisking of egg foams), baking equipment and directions have been simplified so that even the most amateur cook may bake a cake.
How is ice cream sold on beaches?
Today, jobs specialize in the selling of ice cream.
The title of a person who works in this speciality is often called an 'ice cream man', however women also specialize in the selling of ice cream.
People in this line of work often sell ice cream on beaches.
On beaches, ice cream is either sold by a person who carries a box full of ice cream and is called over by people who want the purchase ice cream, or by a person who drives up to the top of the beach and rings a bell.
In the second method, people go up to the top of the beach and purchase ice cream straight from the ice cream seller, who is often in an ice cream van.
In Turkey and Australia, ice cream is sometimes sold to beach-goers from small powerboats equipped with chest freezers.Some ice cream distributors sell ice cream products from traveling refrigerated vans or carts (commonly referred to in the US as "ice cream trucks"), sometimes equipped with speakers playing children's music.
The driver of an ice cream van drives throughout neighborhoods and stops every so often, usually every block.
The ice cream van is usually playing a jingle called "Ice Cream" by Andre Nickatina.
The seller on the ice cream van sells the ice cream through a large window; this window is also where the customer asks for ice cream and pays.
Ice cream vans in the United Kingdom make a music box noise rather than actual music.
Is yogurt rich in protein?
Yogurt is nutritionally rich in protein, calcium, riboflavin, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12.
It has nutritional benefits beyond those of milk.
Lactose-intolerant individuals can sometimes tolerate yogurt better than other dairy products, because the lactose in the milk is converted to glucose and galactose, and partially fermented to lactic acid, by the bacterial culture.Yogurt containing live cultures has been found effective in a randomized trial at preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea.Yogurt contains varying amounts of fat.
There is non-fat (0% fat), low-fat (usually 2% fat) and plain or whole milk yogurt (4% fat).
A study published in the "International Journal of Obesity" (11 January 2005) also found that the consumption of low-fat yogurt can promote weight loss, relative to a gelatin placebo.Yogurt is a valuable health food for both infants and elderly persons.
For children, it is a balanced source of protein, fats, carbohydrates, and minerals.
For senior citizens, who usually have more sensitive colons or whose intestines have run out of lactase, yogurt is also a valuable food.
Elderly intestines showed declining levels of bifidus bacteria, which allow the growth of toxin-producing and, perhaps, cancer-causing bacteria.
Yogurt may help prevent osteoporosis, reduce the risk of high blood pressure.
Yogurt with active cultures helps the gut, may discourage vaginal infections, and may help one feel fuller.The "yogurt defense" was made famous by the trial of Carol Downer, one of the developers of menstrual extraction.
She was arrested at her self-help group and charged with practicing medicine without a license, as she inserted yogurt into the vagina of another woman to treat a yeast condition.
Carol Downer was acquitted; the jury did not equate inserting yogurt with practicing medicine.
Whay cheese was noted for being made from sheeps milk?
Ancient Greek mythology credited Aristaeus with the discovery of cheese.
Homer's "Odyssey" (8th century BCE) describes the Cyclops making and storing sheep's and goats' milk cheese.
From Samuel Butler's translation:By Roman times, cheese was an everyday food and cheesemaking a mature art.
Columella's "De Re Rustica" (circa 65 CE) details a cheesemaking process involving rennet coagulation, pressing of the curd, salting, and aging.
Pliny's "Natural History" (77 CE) devotes a chapter (XI, 97) to describing the diversity of cheeses enjoyed by Romans of the early Empire.
He stated that the best cheeses came from the villages near Nîmes, but did not keep long and had to be eaten fresh.
Cheeses of the Alps and Apennines were as remarkable for their variety then as now.
A Ligurian cheese was noted for being made mostly from sheep's milk, and some cheeses produced nearby were stated to weigh as much as a thousand pounds each.
Goats' milk cheese was a recent taste in Rome, improved over the "medicinal taste" of Gaul's similar cheeses by smoking.
Of cheeses from overseas, Pliny preferred those of Bithynia in Asia Minor.
When was the first reference of coffee in the English language
The first reference to coffee in the English language is in the form "chaoua", dated to 1598.
In English and other European languages, "coffee" descends from the Italian word "caffè".
In turn, "caffè" derives from "kahve", the Ottoman Turkish word for coffee, which is itself derived from the , "qahwah".
Arab lexicographers maintain that "qahwah" originally referred to a type of wine, and gave its etymology, in turn, to the verb "qahā", signifying "to have no appetite", since this beverage was thought to dull one's hunger.Other proposed etymologies include tracing coffee to the word "quwwa," Arabic for power, or to the region of Kaffa in Ethiopia.
For the latter etymology, some hold Arabs named it after the Kaffa region, but others with "equally little authority" say the region was named after the drink.

On what day was "Let It Be" album released?
Let It Be is the twelfth and final studio album released by the English rock band the Beatles.
It was released on 8 May 1970 by the band's Apple Records label shortly after the group announced their break-up.Most of "Let It Be" was recorded in January 1969, before the recording and release of the album "Abbey Road".
For this reason, some critics and fans, such as Mark Lewisohn, argue that "Abbey Road" should be considered the group's final album and "Let It Be" the penultimate.
"Let It Be" was originally intended to be released before "Abbey Road" during mid-1969 as Get Back, but the Beatles were unhappy with this version, which was mixed and compiled by Glyn Johns, and it was temporarily shelved.
A new version of the album was created by Phil Spector in 1970 and finally released as "Let It Be", serving as the album for the 1970 motion picture of the same name.
While three songs from the sessions were released as singles before the album's release, "Get Back"/"Don't Let Me Down" and "Let It Be", the songs were remixed by Spector for the album and "Don't Let Me Down" was not included.Despite a mixed review from "Rolling Stone" magazine at the time of its release, the album was ranked number 86 in the magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time in 2003.
This was, however, adjusted to #392 in the 2012 version.
"Let It Be... Naked" was released in 2003, an alternative version of the album stripping much of Phil Spector's production work and using some different versions of songs.

Who produced "I Want to Hold Your Hand" of The Beatles?
The Beatles started recording "I Want to Hold Your Hand" at EMI Studios in Studio 2 on 17 October 1963.
This song, along with the single's flip side, "This Boy", was the first Beatles song to be recorded with four-track technology.
The two songs were recorded on the same day, and each needed seventeen takes to complete.
Also, the Beatles were experimenting with organ-sounding guitars, which was achieved by extreme compression on John Lennon's rhythm guitar.Mono and stereo mixing was done by George Martin on 21 October 1963; further stereo mixes were done on 8 June 1965, for compilations released by EMI affiliates in Australia and the Netherlands, and on 7 November 1966.
"I Want to Hold Your Hand" was one of two Beatles songs (along with "She Loves You" as ""Sie liebt dich"") to be later recorded in German, entitled "Komm, gib mir deine Hand".
Both songs were translated by Luxembourger musician Camillo Felgen, under the pseudonym of "Jean Nicolas".Odeon, the German arm of EMI (the parent company of the Beatles' record label, Parlophone) was convinced that the Beatles' records would not sell in Germany unless they were sung in German.
The Beatles detested the idea, and when they were due to record the German version on 27 January 1964 at EMI's Pathe Marconi Studios in Paris (where the Beatles were performing 18 days of concerts at the Olympia Theatre) they chose to boycott the session.
Their record producer, George Martin, having waited some hours for them to show up, was outraged and insisted that they give it a try.
Two days later, the Beatles recorded "Komm, gib mir deine Hand", one of the few times in their career that they recorded outside of London.
However, Martin later conceded: "They were right, actually, it wasn’t necessary for them to record in German, but they weren’t graceless, they did a good job".
"Komm, gib mir deine Hand" appeared in full stereo in the United States on the Capitol LP "Something New" and years later on the Capitol CD compilation called "The Capitol Albums, Volume 1".The German-language track was a big hit in Germany at the time, but today, like all the other German-lyrics versions of English-language pop songs that were popular in that country during the 1950s and 1960s, it is generally considered as a cultural curiosity from a by-gone era at best.
The English versions are much better known in Germany today; the Beatles' Red and Blue albums of the 1970s already featured the English hits on the German pressings.
What year did BMI list "Every Breath You Take" on their top 100 songs og the century?
In 1999, "Every Breath You Take" was listed as one of the Top 100 Songs of the Century by BMI.
In 2003, VH1 ranked the song the #2 greatest Break-up song of all time.
And also as of 2003, Sting was still taking in an average of $2000 per day in royalties for the then 20-year-old song "Every Breath You Take.
"In October 2007, Sting was awarded a Million-Air certificate for 9 million airplays of "Every Breath You Take" at the prestigious BMI Awards show in London, with only Van Morrison's "Brown Eyed Girl" a close second at 8 million air plays.Sting performed the song in front of an audience of 1.9 billion people at Live Aid in 1985, with Phil Collins providing additional vocals.
Sting performed it again, 20 years later, at Live 8.
Who was "Free Bird" written in memory of?
According to guitarist Gary Rossington, for two years after Allen Collins wrote the initial chords, vocalist Ronnie Van Zant insisted that there were too many for him to create a melody in the belief that the melody needed to change alongside the chords.
After Collins played the unused sequence at rehearsal one day, Van Zant asked him to repeat it, then wrote out the melody and lyrics in three or four minutes.
The guitar solos that finish the song were added in originally to give Van Zant a chance to rest, as the band was playing several sets per night at clubs at the time.
Soon afterward, the band learned piano-playing roadie Billy Powell had written an intro to the song; upon hearing it, they included it as the finishing touch and had him formally join as their keyboardist.
The song was originally written in memory of Duane Allman.Allen Collins's then-girlfriend, Kathy, whom he later married, asked him, "If I leave here tomorrow, would you still remember me?"
Collins noted the question and it eventually became the opening line of "Free Bird".

What kind of ratings has 'The Big Bang Theory' received?
"The Big Bang Theory" has been highly rated since its premiere.
When the third season premiered on September 21, 2009, "The Big Bang Theory" ranked as CBS's highest-rated show of that evening in the adults 18–49 demographic (4.6/10) along with a then-series-high 12.83 million viewers.
After the first three seasons aired at different times on Monday nights, CBS moved the show to Thursdays at 8:00 ET for the 2010–2011 schedule, to be in direct competition with NBC's Comedy Block.
During its fourth season, it became television's highest rated comedy, just barely beating out eight-year champ "Two and a Half Men".
However, in the age 18–49 demographic (the show's target age range), it was the second highest rated comedy, behind ABC's "Modern Family".
The fifth season opened with viewing figures of over 14 million.The sixth season boasts some of the highest-rated episodes for the show so far, with a then-new series high set with "The Bakersfield Expedition" (Season 6, Episode 13), with 20 million viewers, a first for the series, which along with "NCIS", made CBS the first network to have two scripted series reach that large an audience in the same week since 2007.
In the sixth season, the show became the highest rated and viewed scripted show in the 18–49 demographic, trailing only "NBC's Sunday Night Football" coverage, and was third in total viewers, trailing "NCIS" and "Sunday Night Football".
Season seven of the show opened strong, continuing the success gained in season six, with the second episode of the premiere, "The Deception Verification", setting the new series high in viewers with 20.44 million.Showrunner Steve Molaro, who took over from Bill Prady with the sixth season, credits some of the show's success to the sitcom's exposure in off-network syndication, particularly on TBS, while Michael Schneider of "TV Guide" attributes it to the timeslot move two seasons earlier.
Chuck Lorre and CBS Entertainment president Nina Tassler also credit the success to the influence of Molaro, in particular the deepening exploration of the firmly established regular characters and their interpersonal relationships, such as the on-again, off-again relationship between Leonard and Penny.
Throughout much of the 2012–13 season, "The Big Bang Theory" placed first in all of syndication ratings, receiving formidable competition from only "Judge Judy" and "Wheel of Fortune" (first-run syndication programs).
By the end of the 2012–13 television season, "The Big Bang Theory" had dethroned "Judge Judy" as the ratings leader in all of syndicated programming with 7.1, "Judy" descending to second place for that season with a 7.0.
What was the worldwide gross of Teen Wolf?
Release.Box office.Released on August 23, 1985, "Teen Wolf" debuted at #2 in its opening weekend, behind "Back to the Future" (also starring Michael J.
Fox).
After its initial run, the film grossed $33,086,661 domestically, with a worldwide gross of about $80 million.
What is the teddy bear missing?
A motif within the second season is the image of a damaged teddy bear and its missing eye.
The teddy bear first appears at the end of the music video "Fallacies" for Jesse's band "TwaüghtHammër", which was released as a webisode in February 2009 leading to the second season.
The teddy bear can also be spotted on the mural on Jane's bedroom wall during the final episode of the second season, further connecting the crash to Jane.
It is seen in flashforwards during four episodes, the titles of which, when put together in order, form the sentence "Seven Thirty-Seven down over ABQ".
The flashforwards are shot in black and white, with the sole exception of the pink teddy bear, which is an homage to the film "Schindler's List", in which the color red is used to distinguish a little girl in a coat.
At the end of the season, Walter indirectly helps cause the midair collision of two airplanes; the pink teddy bear is then revealed to have fallen out of one of the planes and into the White family's pool.
Vince Gilligan called the plane accident an attempt to visualize "all the terrible grief that Walt has wrought upon his loved ones" and "the judgment of God.
"In the first episode of the third season, the NTSB fishes the teddy bear out of his pool and Walt later finds the missing eye in the pool filter.
Television critic Myles McNutt has called it "a symbol of the damage feels responsible for," and "The A.V.
Club" commented that "the pink teddy bear continues to accuse."
Fans and critics have compared the appearance of the teddy bear's face to an image of Gus Fring's face in the fourth season finale.The teddy bear was auctioned off, among other memorabilia, on September 29, 2013, the air date of the show finale.
On October 29 of the same year, Aaron Paul posted production pictures of Cranston posing with the teddy bear on Instagram.

The characteristics for each character in the pilot were based on what book?
Production.Development.The "Gossip Girl" book series was originally supposed to be adapted into a film starring Lindsay Lohan with head "Gilmore Girls" creator Amy Sherman-Palladino.
When the film project did not get off the ground, Stephanie Savage and Josh Schwartz took over the project to create a television series.
As of October 2006, Schwartz was working on the pilot.
He said: "I was very skeptical.
I don't want to do "The O.C.
NYC".
But I thought the books were smart.
The characters are worldly in a way that Orange County kids aren't."
The characteristics for each character in the pilot were based on the first "Gossip Girl" book.
In January 2007, the show was given the green light by The CW.
In what category was the only Emmy nomination and win for "Gilmore Girls"?

Which TV show has been described by Clive Thompson of Wired as "the most tech-savvy show on TV"?
"The Good Wife" has been well received among technology enthusiasts, being described by Clive Thompson of Wired as "the most tech-savvy show on TV".
The show has explored the relationship between technology and the law, covering topics including Bitcoin, Anonymous, viral marketing in political campaigns, voice control software, virtual conferencing robots, and NSA surveillance.
For example, one of the firm's recurring clients is a fictional internet search company known as Chumhum, which among other issues has faced privacy lawsuits for selling users' personal data to the Chinese and Syrian government.
"The Good Wife" was the first TV show to feature Bitcoin, the virtual internet currency, with an episode featuring Bitcoin first broadcast in January 2012.
This led to it achieving a high level of fame amongst the Bitcoin community.In the season 5 premiere, a Double Robotics robot was featured on the show which allowed a litigator to teleconference from home by controlling a tablet on wheels.
However, rather than glorifying the robot's features, "The Good Wife" turned it into a punchline with practical jokes and problems the robot could have such as it not being able to maneuver around an office and bumping into walls, doors and people and low Wi-Fi connectivity leading to buffering and loss of visual and voice communication of the person working at home.In Episode 9 "Whack-a-Mole" "The Good Wife" featured a version of Reddit called "Scabbit" and how it affects the law and the downsides of having an "average joe" being an investigator trying to find a domestic terrorist.
It also deals with injunctions of taking down a defamatory web page on "Scabbit" but having another similar web page pop up soon after.In Episode 11 "Goliath and David" the story is based around a TV Show 'Drama Camp' who stole an Indie band's cover of a rap song and deals with the legality of copyright infringement.
It was inspired by Jonathan Coulton who created a cover of 'Baby Got Back' and Glee, the TV series, which used an identical cover on the show.
The character 'Robyn Burdine' who's a private investigator for Florrick/Agos discovers that the show Drama Camp had to release the song on iTunes in Sweden before releasing it in the USA and that the engineers directly ripped the Indie band's track constituting actual theft.
"Family Guy" debuted to 22 million viewers following which annual ratings machine?
"Family Guy" officially premiered after Fox's broadcast of Super Bowl XXXIII on January 31, 1999, with "Death Has a Shadow".
The show debuted to 22 million viewers, and immediately generated controversy regarding its adult content.
The show returned on April 11, 1999, with "I Never Met the Dead Man".
"Family Guy" garnered decent ratings in Fox's 8:30 pm slot on Sunday, scheduled between "The Simpsons" and "The X-Files".
At the end of its first season, the show was No.
33 in the Nielsen ratings, with 12.8 million households tuning in.
The show launched its second season in a new time slot, Thursday at 9 pm, on September 23, 1999.
"Family Guy" was pitted against NBC's "Frasier", and the series' ratings declined sharply.
Fox removed "Family Guy" from the network's permanent schedule, and began airing episodes irregularly.
The show returned on March 7, 2000, at 8:30 pm on Tuesdays, but was constantly beaten in the ratings by the new breakout hit "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire", coming in at No.
114 in the Nielsen Ratings with 6.320 million households tuning in.
Fox announced that the show had been canceled in 2000, at the end of the second season.
However, following a last-minute reprieve, Fox announced on July 24, 2000, its intention to order 13 additional episodes of "Family Guy" to form a third season.The show returned November 8, 2001, once again in a tough time slot: Thursday nights at 8:00 pm ET.
This slot brought it into competition with "Survivor" and "Friends".
(This situation was later referenced in "").
During its second- and third-season runs, Fox frequently moved the show around to different days and time slots with little or no notice and, consequently, the show's ratings suffered.
Upon Fox's annual unveiling of its 2002 fall line-up on May 15, 2002, "Family Guy" was absent.
Fox announced that the show had been officially canceled shortly thereafter.
How much money does merchandising for South Park generate per year?
Merchandising related to the show is an industry which generates several million dollars a year.

Which direction has the Niagra Falls moved over the past 10,900 years?
The features that became Niagara Falls were created by the Wisconsin glaciation about 10,000 years ago.
The same forces also created the North American Great Lakes and the Niagara River.
All were dug by a continental ice sheet that drove through the area, deepening some river channels to form lakes, and damming others with debris.
Scientists argue that there is an old valley, buried by glacial drift, at the approximate location of the present Welland Canal.When the ice melted, the upper Great Lakes emptied into the Niagara river, which followed the rearranged topography across the Niagara Escarpment.
In time, the river cut a gorge through the north facing cliff, or cuesta.
Because of the interactions of three major rock formations, the rocky bed did not erode evenly.
The top rock formation was composed of erosion-resistant limestone and Lockport dolostone.
That hard layer of stone eroded more slowly than the underlying materials.
The aerial photo on the right clearly shows the hard caprock, the Lockport Formation (Middle Silurian), which underlies the rapids above the falls, and approximately the upper third of the high gorge wall.Immediately below the hard-rock formation, comprising about two thirds of the cliff, lay the weaker, softer, sloping Rochester Formation (Lower Silurian).
This formation was composed mainly of shale, though it has some thin limestone layers.
It also contains ancient fossils.
In time, the river eroded the soft layer that supported the hard layers, undercutting the hard caprock, which gave way in great chunks.
This process repeated countless times, eventually carving out the falls.Submerged in the river in the lower valley, hidden from view, is the Queenston Formation (Upper Ordovician), which is composed of shales and fine sandstones.
All three formations were laid down in an ancient sea, their differences of character deriving from changing conditions within that sea.About 10,900 years ago, the Niagara Falls was located between present-day Queenston, Ontario, and Lewiston, New York, but erosion of their crest has caused the waterfalls to retreat approximately southward.
The Horseshoe Falls, which are approximately wide, have also changed their shape through the process of erosion; evolving from a small arch, to a horseshoe bend, to the present day gigantic inverted V. Just upstream from the falls' current location, Goat Island splits the course of the Niagara River, resulting in the separation of the Canadian Horseshoe Falls to the west from the American and Bridal Veil Falls to the east.
Engineering has slowed erosion and recession.
Who was the master builder of the Opera di Santa Maria Maggiore?
 One possible builder is Gerardo di Gerardo.
His name appears as a witness to the above legacy of Berta di Bernardo as "Master Gerardo", and as a worker whose name was Gerardo.
 A more probable builder is Diotisalvi, because of the construction period and the structure's affinities with other buildings in Pisa.
But he usually signed his works, and there is no signature by him in the bell tower.
 Giovanni di Simone was heavily involved in the completion of the tower, under the direction of Giovanni Pisano, who at the time was master builder of the Opera di Santa Maria Maggiore.
He could be the same Giovanni Pisano who completed the belfry tower.
How many restaurants are in the Eiffel tower?
The tower has two restaurants: "Le 58 tour Eiffel", on the first floors and the "Le Jules Verne", a gourmet restaurant on the second floor, with a private lift.
This restaurant has one star in the Michelin Red Guide.
It is run by the multi-Michelin star chef Alain Ducasse.
The Incas build a road to where?
As part of their road system, the Incas built a road to the Machu Picchu region.
Today, thousands of tourists walk the Inca Trail to visit Machu Picchu each year.
They congregate at Cusco before starting on the two-, four- or five-day journey on foot from Kilometer 82 or Kilometer 104 (two-day trip) near the town of Ollantaytambo in the Urubamba valley, walking up through the Andes mountain range to the isolated city.The people of Machu Picchu were connected to long-distance trade, as shown by non-local artifacts found at the site.
As an example, Bingham found unmodified obsidian nodules at the entrance gateway.
In the 1970s, Burger and Asaro determined that these obsidian samples were from the "Titicaca" or Chivay obsidian source, and that the samples from Machu Picchu showed long-distance transport of this obsidian type in pre-Hispanic Peru.
In what year did Disney drop individual ride tickets and switch to a single admission price?
From Disneyland's opening day until 1982, the price of the attractions was in addition to the price of park admission.
Guests paid a small admission fee to get into the park, but admission to most of the rides and attractions required guests to purchase tickets, either individually or in a book, that consisted of several coupons, initially labeled "A" through "C".
"A" coupons allowed admission to the smaller rides and attractions such as the vehicles on Main Street, whereas "C" coupons were used for the most common attractions like the Peter Pan ride, or the Tea Cups.
As more thrilling rides were introduced, such as the Monorail or the Matterhorn bobsled, "D" and then eventually "E" coupons were introduced.
Coupons could be combined to equal the equivalent of another ticket (e.g.
two "A" tickets equal one "B" ticket).
From the thrill ride experience at Disneyland, the colloquial expression "an E ticket ride" is used to describe any exceptionally thrilling experience.Disneyland later featured a "Keys to the Kingdom" booklet of tickets, which consisted of 10 unvalued coupons sold for a single flat rate.
These coupons could be used for any attraction regardless of its regular value.In 1982, Disney dropped the idea for individual ride tickets to a single admission price with unlimited access to all attractions, "except shooting galleries".
While this idea was not original to Disney, its business advantages were obvious: in addition to guaranteeing that everyone paid a large sum even if they stayed for only a few hours and rode only a few rides, the park no longer had to print tickets or ticket books, staff ticket booths, or provide staff to collect tickets or monitor attractions for people sneaking on without tickets.
Later, Disney introduced other entry options such as multi-day passes, Annual Passes (which allow unlimited entry to the Park for an annual fee), and Southern California residents' discounts.
In what year were the Manchus able to cross the Great Wall?
The Great Wall concept was revived again during the Ming Dynasty in the 14th century, and following the Ming army's defeat by the Oirats in the Battle of Tumu.
The Ming had failed to gain a clear upper hand over the Manchurian and Mongolian tribes after successive battles, and the long-drawn conflict was taking a toll on the empire.
The Ming adopted a new strategy to keep the nomadic tribes out by constructing walls along the northern border of China.
Acknowledging the Mongol control established in the Ordos Desert, the wall followed the desert's southern edge instead of incorporating the bend of the Yellow River.Unlike the earlier fortifications, the Ming construction was stronger and more elaborate due to the use of bricks and stone instead of rammed earth.
Up to 25,000 watchtowers are estimated to have been constructed on the wall.
As Mongol raids continued periodically over the years, the Ming devoted considerable resources to repair and reinforce the walls.
Sections near the Ming capital of Beijing were especially strong.
Qi Jiguang between 1567 and 1570 also repaired and reinforced the wall, faced sections of the ram-earth wall with bricks and constructed 1,200 watchtowers from Shanhaiguan Pass to Changping to warn of approaching Mongol raiders.
During the 1440s–1460s, the Ming also built a so-called "Liaodong Wall".
Similar in function to the Great Wall (whose extension, in a sense, it was), but more basic in construction, the Liaodong Wall enclosed the agricultural heartland of the Liaodong province, protecting it against potential incursions by Jurched-Mongol Oriyanghan from the northwest and the Jianzhou Jurchens from the north.
While stones and tiles were used in some parts of the Liaodong Wall, most of it was in fact simply an earth dike with moats on both sides.Towards the end of the Ming Dynasty, the Great Wall helped defend the empire against the Manchu invasions that began around 1600.
Even after the loss of all of Liaodong, the Ming army held the heavily fortified Shanhaiguan pass, preventing the Manchus from conquering the Chinese heartland.
The Manchus were finally able to cross the Great Wall in 1644, after Beijing had already fallen to Li Zicheng's rebels.
Before this time, the Manchus had crossed the Great Wall multiple times to raid, but this time it was for conquest.
The gates at Shanhaiguan were opened by the commanding Ming general Wu Sangui on May 25 who formed an alliance with the Manchus, hoping to use the Manchus to expel the rebels from Beijing.
The Manchus quickly seized Beijing, and defeated both the rebel-founded Shun Dynasty and the remaining Ming resistance, establishing the Qing Dynasty rule over all of China.Under Qing rule, China's borders extended beyond the walls and Mongolia was annexed into the empire, so constructions on the Great Wall were discontinued.
On the other hand, the so-called Willow Palisade, following a line similar to that of the Ming Liaodong Wall, was constructed by the Qing rulers in Manchuria.
Its purpose, however, was not defense but rather migration control.
Who was the first European to see Victoria Falls?
Archaeological sites around the falls have yielded "Homo habilis" stone artifacts from 3 million years ago, 50,000-year-old Middle Stone Age tools and Late Stone Age (10,000 and 2,000 years ago) weapons, adornments and digging tools.
Iron-using Khoisan hunter-gatherers displaced these Stone Age people and in turn were displaced by Bantu tribes such as the southern Tonga people known as the Batoka/Tokalea, who called the falls "Shungu na mutitima".
The Matabele, later arrivals, named them "aManz' aThunqayo", and the Batswana and Makololo (whose language is used by the Lozi people) call them "Mosi-o-Tunya".
All these names mean essentially "the smoke that thunders".A map from c.1750 drawn by Jacques Nicolas Bellin for Abbé Antoine François Prevost d'Exiles marks the falls as "cataractes" and notes a settlement to the north of the Zambezi as being friendly with the Portuguese at the time.
Earlier still Nicolas de Fer's 1715 map of southern Africa has the fall clearly marked in the correct position.
It also has dotted lines denoting trade routes that David Livingstone followed 140 years later.The first European to see the falls was David Livingstone on 17 November 1855, during his 1852–56 journey from the upper Zambezi to the mouth of the river.
The falls were well known to local tribes, and Voortrekker hunters may have known of them, as may the Arabs under a name equivalent to "the end of the world".
Europeans were sceptical of their reports, perhaps thinking that the lack of mountains and valleys on the plateau made a large falls unlikely.Livingstone had been told about the falls before he reached them from upriver and was paddled across to a small island that now bears the name Livingstone Island in Zambia.
Livingstone had previously been impressed by the Ngonye Falls further upstream, but found the new falls much more impressive, and gave them their English name in honour of Queen Victoria.
He wrote of the falls, "No one can imagine the beauty of the view from anything witnessed in England.
It had never been seen before by European eyes; but scenes so lovely must have been gazed upon by angels in their flight.
"In 1860, Livingstone returned to the area and made a detailed study of the falls with John Kirk.
Other early European visitors included Portuguese explorer Serpa Pinto, Czech explorer Emil Holub, who made the first detailed plan of the falls and its surroundings in 1875 (published in 1880), and British artist Thomas Baines, who executed some of the earliest paintings of the falls.
Until the area was opened up by the building of the railway in 1905, though, the falls were seldom visited by other Europeans.
How did the defendant plead in his case relating to wildlife crime?
The entire park is within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming, making it the only federal court district that includes portions of more than one state (Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming).
Law professor Brian C. Kalt has argued that it may be impossible to impanel a jury in compliance with the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment for a crime committed solely in the unpopulated Idaho portion of the park (and that it would be difficult to do so for a crime committed solely in the lightly populated Montana portion).
One defendant accused of a wildlife-related crime in the Montana portion of the park attempted to raise this argument.
He eventually pleaded guilty.
What year did 8 gold miners get attacked?
History.Ahwahneechee and the Mariposa Wars.As revealed by archeological finds, the Yosemite Valley has been inhabited for nearly 3000 years.
The Paiute and Sierra Miwok peoples lived in the area long before the first explorations by American settlers into the region.
A band of Paiute called the "Ahwahneechee" were living in the Yosemite Valley when the first known group of European Americans entered it.The California Gold Rush in the mid-19th century dramatically increased travel by European-Americans in the area, causing competition for resources between the regional Paiute and Miwok and the miners and hangers on.
In 1851 as part of the Mariposa Wars intended to suppress Native American resistance, United States Army Major Jim Savage led the Mariposa Battalion into the west end of Yosemite Valley.
He was pursuing forces of around 200 Ahwahneechee led by Chief Tenaya.Accounts from this battalion were the first well-documented reports of ethnic Europeans entering Yosemite Valley.
Attached to Savage's unit was Dr. Lafayette Bunnell, the company physician, who later wrote about his awestruck impressions of the valley in "The Discovery of the Yosemite".
Bunnell is credited with naming Yosemite Valley, based on his interviews with Chief Tenaya.
Bunnell wrote that Chief Tenaya was the founder of the Pai-Ute Colony of Ah-wah-nee.
The Miwok, a neighboring tribe, and most white settlers considered the Ahwahneechee to be especially violent because of their frequent territorial disputes.
The Miwok term for the Pai-Ute band was "yohhe'meti," meaning "they are killers".
Correspondence and articles written by members of the battalion helped to popularize the natural wonders of the Yosemite Valley and the surrounding area.Chief Tenaya and his Ahwahneechee were eventually captured and their village burned; they were removed to a reservation near Fresno, California.
The chief and some others were later allowed to return to Yosemite Valley.
In the spring of 1852 they attacked a group of eight gold miners, and then moved east to flee law enforcement.
Near Mono Lake, they took refuge with the nearby Mono tribe of Paiute.
They stole horses from their hosts and moved away, but the Mono Paiutes tracked down and killed many of the Ahwahneechee, including Chief Tenaya.
The Mono Paiute took the survivors as captives back to Mono Lake and absorbed them into the Mono Lake Paiute tribe.
A reconstructed "Indian Village of Ahwahnee" has been erected behind the Yosemite Museum, located next to the Yosemite Valley Visitor Center.
How many visitors are there to the Grand Canyon National Park each year?
 tourism.Grand Canyon National Park is one of the world’s premier natural attractions, attracting about five million visitors per year.
Overall, 83% were from the United States: California (12.2%), Arizona (8.9%), Texas (4.8%), Florida (3.4%) and New York (3.2%) represented the top domestic visitors.
Seventeen percent of visitors were from outside the United States; the most prominently represented nations were the United Kingdom (3.8%), Canada (3.5%), Japan (2.1%), Germany (1.9%) and The Netherlands (1.2%).The South Rim is open all year round weather permitting.
The North Rim is generally open mid-May to mid-October.
What tribe did the United Stated seize the area Mount Rushmore is in from?
Mount Rushmore is controversial among Native Americans because the United States seized the area from the Lakota tribe after the Great Sioux War of 1876.
The Treaty of Fort Laramie from 1868 had previously granted the Black Hills to the Lakota in perpetuity.
Members of the American Indian Movement led an occupation of the monument in 1971, naming it "Mount Crazy Horse".
Among the participants were young activists, grandparents, children and Lakota holy man John Fire Lame Deer, who planted a prayer staff atop the mountain.
Lame Deer said the staff formed a symbolic shroud over the presidents' faces "which shall remain dirty until the treaties concerning the Black Hills are fulfilled.
"In 2004, the first Native American superintendent of the park was appointed.
Gerard Baker has stated that he will open up more "avenues of interpretation", and that the four presidents are "only one avenue and only one focus.
"The Crazy Horse Memorial is being constructed elsewhere in the Black Hills to commemorate the famous Native American leader and as a response to Mount Rushmore.
It is intended to be larger than Mount Rushmore and has the support of Lakota chiefs; the Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation has rejected offers of federal funds.
However, this memorial is likewise the subject of controversy, even within the Native American community.
What year did workers of the Space Needle begin working without a contract?
In 2012, the union workers of the Space Needle started working without a contract when the current contract expired.
The workers, working with the union, Unite Here Local 8, have entered into contract negotiations with the owners.
The owners have made it clear that they don't want to extend a contract with the workers or the union because of terminology used in the contract.
The Space Needle believes it offered employees enough security under past contracts without explicitly promising no subcontracting, which is what the workers want in the new contract.
This would likely limit the company's ability to hire workers on a needed basis such as peak seasons or special events.
But instead of striking this item from the contract, Unite Here has pushed for picketing outside of the Space Needle on a weekly basis until such contract terms are accepted.In 2013, federal mediation was set to begin between workers and the owners of the Space Needle.
What was closed to the public immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks?
Closures and reopening (2001–present).Following the September 11 attacks, the statue and Liberty Island were immediately closed to the public.
The island reopened at the end of 2001, while the pedestal and statue remained off-limits.
The pedestal reopened in August 2004, but the National Park Service announced that visitors could not safely be given access to the statue due to the difficulty of evacuation in an emergency.
The Park Service adhered to that position through the remainder of the Bush administration.
New York Congressman Anthony Weiner made the statue's reopening a personal crusade.
On May 17, 2009, President Barack Obama's Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar, announced that as a "special gift" to America, the statue would be reopened to the public as of July 4, but that only a limited number of people would be permitted to ascend to the crown each day.The statue, including the pedestal and base, closed on October 29, 2011 (the day after celebrations to mark the statue's 125th anniversary), for installation of new elevators and staircases, and to bring other facilities, such as restrooms, up to code.
The statue was closed to the public until October 28, 2012.
A day after the reopening, the statue closed again due to the effects of Hurricane Sandy.
Although the storm did not harm the statue, it destroyed some of the infrastructure on both Liberty Island and Ellis Island, severely damaging the dock used by the ferries bearing visitors to the statue.
On November 8, 2012, a Park Service spokesperson announced that both islands would remain closed for an indefinite period for repairs to be done.
Due to lack of electricity on Liberty Island, a generator was installed to power temporary floodlights to illuminate the statue at night.
The superintendent of Statue of Liberty National Monument, David Luchsinger, whose home on the island was severely damaged, stated that it would be "optimistically ... months" before the island was reopened to the public.
The statue and Liberty Island reopened to the public on July 4, 2013, though Ellis Island remains closed.
For part of October 2013, Liberty Island was closed to the public due to the United States federal government shutdown of 2013, along with other publicly funded museums, parks, monuments, construction projects and buildings.
How many roller coasters does SeaWorld Orlando have?
 Orlando.SeaWorld Orlando opened on December 15, 1973, and had crowds topping 5,400 on its opening day.
"One Ocean", a new Shamu show which premiered April 22, 2011, is hosted here, along with "Clyde and Seamore Take Pirate Island", an adventure with two sea lions, and "Blue Horizons", the park's dolphin show.
The park contains 3 roller coasters: Kraken, a floorless coaster based on the mythical sea creature, Manta, a coaster designed to simulate how manta rays move, and the Shamu Express, a coaster oriented to kids located in Shamu's Happy Harbor.
It is also home to the original Journey to Atlantis Water Coaster.
SeaWorld After Dark is SeaWorld Orlando's night program, featuring the fireworks show "Reflections", a sea lions show "Sea Lions Tonite" and Shamu show "Shamu Rocks".
What is Rhineland named after?
Rhineland is named after its Bavarian architecture and is the first park section located within the park’s gates.
Like Tudor Square, Rhineland is not home to any attractions but does include a wide variety of gift shops as well as a Nathan’s, Famous Famiglia Pizzeria, and the Central PA's Kosher Mart.
The Kosher Mart building was, until 1992, the Rhineland entrance of the Sky Ride - a ski lift transport ride which took you to Minetown, near the Kissing Tower and Twin Turnpike (which is now the location of Great Bear).
What company did Six Flags partner with to make their video game?
Six Flags has licensed its name and its theme park creations to other companies, who have used these assets to create licensed products.
One such example is the theme park simulation game Roller Coaster Tycoon 2, which featured recreations of Six Flags parks and rides that could be expanded and operated at the player's discretion.
Six Flags has also partnered with Brash Entertainment to create a video game called Six Flags Fun Park.
It allows the player to explore the themed areas and mini-games representative of a visit to a Six Flags park.
In the game, players are tasked with quests that encourage them to explore the park's universe.
After creating a unique custom character, Six Flags Fun Park patrons can win prizes, and compete with other players in 40 mini-games.
Although the video game is called "Six Flags Fun Park", it lacks any major reference of Six Flags.
This caused some to speculate that the video game was created then the rights to the name of the game were sold as a way to pay for the game's development.In recent years, Six Flags has created strategic partnerships with other companies who would feature their products inside the parks.
On March 30, 2006, Six Flags announced that it will sell no other pizza besides Papa John's at its parks.
In turn, Six Flags will receive an annual sponsorship and promotional opportunities from Papa John's, though financial details of the deal have not been disclosed.
However, in the 2011 season, it was replaced by another pizza brand.
Other recent partners have included Cold Stone Creamery, Johnny Rockets, Tyson Foods (chicken), Chrysler, and Nintendo, which added testing stations in several parks to show off its Wii console.In late 2010, Six Flags began the process of removing licensed theming from attractions.
They terminated licenses with Thomas the Tank Engine, The Wiggles, Tony Hawk, Evel Knievel, and Terminator.
When was the Battle of the Beanfield?
Throughout the 20th century, Stonehenge began to be revived as a place of religious significance, this time by adherents of Neopagan and New Age beliefs, particularly the Neo-druids.
The historian Ronald Hutton would later remark that "it was a great, and potentially uncomfortable, irony that modern Druids had arrived at Stonehenge just as archaeologists were evicting the ancient Druids from it."
The first such Neo-druidic group to make use of the megalithic monument was the Ancient Order of Druids, who performed a mass initiation ceremony there in August 1905, in which they admitted 259 new members into their organisation.
This assembly was largely ridiculed in the press, who mocked the fact that the Neo-druids were dressed up in costumes consisting of white robes and fake beards.Between 1972 and 1984, Stonehenge was the site of the Stonehenge Free Festival.
After the Battle of the Beanfield in 1985, this use of the site was stopped for several years and ritual use of Stonehenge is now heavily restricted.
Some Druids have arranged an assembling of monuments styled on Stonehenge in other parts of the world.
What's the difference between 'immum' and 'summum'?
According to the Codex-Calendar of 354, the Colosseum could accommodate 87,000 people, although modern estimates put the figure at around 50,000.
They were seated in a tiered arrangement that reflected the rigidly stratified nature of Roman society.
Special boxes were provided at the north and south ends respectively for the Emperor and the Vestal Virgins, providing the best views of the arena.
Flanking them at the same level was a broad platform or "podium" for the senatorial class, who were allowed to bring their own chairs.
The names of some 5th century senators can still be seen carved into the stonework, presumably reserving areas for their use.The tier above the senators, known as the "maenianum primum", was occupied by the non-senatorial noble class or knights ("equites").
The next level up, the "maenianum secundum", was originally reserved for ordinary Roman citizens ("plebeians") and was divided into two sections.
The lower part (the "immum") was for wealthy citizens, while the upper part (the "summum") was for poor citizens.
Specific sectors were provided for other social groups: for instance, boys with their tutors, soldiers on leave, foreign dignitaries, scribes, heralds, priests and so on.
Stone (and later marble) seating was provided for the citizens and nobles, who presumably would have brought their own cushions with them.
Inscriptions identified the areas reserved for specific groups.Another level, the "maenianum secundum in legneis", was added at the very top of the building during the reign of Domitian.
This comprised a gallery for the common poor, slaves and women.
It would have been either standing room only, or would have had very steep wooden benches.
Some groups were banned altogether from the Colosseum, notably gravediggers, actors and former gladiators.Each tier was divided into sections ("maeniana") by curved passages and low walls ("praecinctiones" or "baltei"), and were subdivided into "cunei", or wedges, by the steps and aisles from the vomitoria.
Each row ("gradus") of seats was numbered, permitting each individual seat to be exactly designated by its gradus, cuneus, and number.
Who moved the "Mona Lisa" to the Palace of Versailles?
Leonardo da Vinci began painting the "Mona Lisa" in 1503 or 1504 in Florence, Italy.
Although the Louvre states that it was "doubtless painted between 1503 and 1506", the art historian Martin Kemp says there is some difficulty in confirming the actual dates with certainty.
According to Leonardo's contemporary, Giorgio Vasari, "after he had lingered over it four years, left it unfinished".
Leonardo, later in his life, is said to have regretted "never having completed a single work".In 1516 Leonardo was invited by King François I to work at the Clos Lucé near the king's castle in Amboise.
It is believed that he took the "Mona Lisa" with him and continued to work after he moved to France.
Art historian Carmen C. Bambach has concluded that da Vinci probably continued refining the work until 1516 or 1517.On his death the painting was inherited, among other works, by his pupil and assistant Salaì.The king bought the painting for 4,000 "écus" and kept it at Palace of Fontainebleau, where it remained until given to Louis XIV.
Louis XIV moved the painting to the Palace of Versailles.
After the French Revolution, it was moved to the Louvre, but spent a brief period in the bedroom of Napoleon in the Tuileries Palace.During the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871) it was moved from the Louvre to the Brest Arsenal.
During World War II, the painting was again removed from the Louvre and taken safely, first to Château d'Amboise, then to the Loc-Dieu Abbey and Château de Chambord, then finally to the Ingres Museum in Montauban.
How did Van Gogh die?
Vincent Willem van Gogh (; 30 March 185329 July 1890) was a post-Impressionist painter of Dutch origin whose work, notable for its rough beauty, emotional honesty and bold color, had a far-reaching influence on 20th-century art.
After years of painful anxiety and frequent bouts of mental illness, he died aged 37 from a gunshot wound, generally accepted to be self-inflicted (although no gun was ever found).
His work was then known to only a handful of people and appreciated by fewer still.Van Gogh began to draw as a child, and he continued to draw throughout the years that led up to his decision to become an artist.
He did not begin painting until his late twenties, completing many of his best-known works during the last two years of his life.
In just over a decade, he produced more than 2,100 artworks, consisting of 860 oil paintings and more than 1,300 watercolors, drawings, sketches and prints.
His work included self portraits, landscapes, still lifes, portraits and paintings of cypresses, wheat fields and sunflowers.Van Gogh spent his early adulthood working for a firm of art dealers, traveling between The Hague, London and Paris, after which he taught for a time in England at Isleworth and Ramsgate.
One of his early aspirations was to become a pastor and from 1879 he worked as a missionary in a mining region in Belgium where he began to sketch people from the local community.
In 1885, he painted his first major work "The Potato Eaters".
His palette at the time consisted mainly of somber earth tones and showed no sign of the vivid coloration that distinguished his later work.
In March 1886, he moved to Paris and discovered the French Impressionists.
Later, he moved to the south of France and was influenced by the strong sunlight he found there.
His work grew brighter in color, and he developed the unique and highly recognizable style that became fully realized during his stay in Arles in 1888.The extent to which his mental health affected his painting has been a subject of speculation since his death.
Despite a widespread tendency to romanticize his ill health, modern critics see an artist deeply frustrated by the inactivity and incoherence brought about by his bouts of illness.
According to art critic Robert Hughes, Van Gogh's late works show an artist at the height of his ability, completely in control and "longing for concision and grace."
What part of the Sphinx has been damaged?
Over the years several authors have commented on what they perceive as "Negroid" characteristics in the face of the Sphinx.
This issue has become part of the Ancient Egyptian race controversy, with respect to the ancient population as a whole.
The face of the Sphinx has been damaged over the millennia.
What painting is very similar to Van Gogh's "Starry Night"?
Simon Singh, in his book "Big Bang", says that "Starry Night" has striking similarities to a sketch of the "Whirlpool Galaxy", drawn by Lord Rosse 44 years before Van Gogh's work.
The painting has been compared to an astronomical photograph of a star named V838 Monocerotis, taken by the Hubble in 2004.
The clouds of gas surrounding the star resemble the swirling patterns Van Gogh used in this painting.
Art historian Joachim Pissarro cites "Starry Night" as an exemplar of the artist's fascination with the nocturnal.
What action of Munch's prefigured Andy Warhol's later use of Munch's work?
In the late twentieth century, "The Scream" was imitated, parodied, and outright copies have been made following its copyright expiration, which led to it acquiring an iconic status in popular culture.
It was used on the cover of some editions of Arthur Janov's book "The Primal Scream".
In 1983–1984, pop artist Andy Warhol made a series of silk prints copying works by Munch, including "The Scream".
His stated intention was to desacralize the painting by making it into a mass-reproducible object.
Munch had already begun that process, however, by making a lithograph of the work for reproduction.
Erró's ironic and irreverent treatment of Munch's masterpiece in his acrylic paintings "The Second Scream" (1967) and "Ding Dong" (1979) is considered a characteristic of post-modern art.
Cartoonist Gary Larson included a "tribute" to "The Scream" (entitled "The Whine") in his "Wiener Dog Art" painting and cartoon compilation, in which the central figure is replaced by a howling dachshund.
"The Scream" has been used in advertising, in cartoons, such as "The Simpsons", films, and on television.
The principal alien antagonists depicted in the 2011 BBC series of "Doctor Who", named "The Silence", have an appearance partially based on "The Scream".
The Ghostface mask worn by the primary antagonists of the "Scream" series of horror movies is based on the painting, and was created by Fun World employee, Brigitte Sleiertin, as a Halloween costume, prior to being discovered by Marianne Maddalena and Wes Craven for the film.In 2013, The Scream was one of four paintings that the Norwegian postal service chose for a series of stamps marking the 150th anniversary of Edvard Munch’s birth.A patient resource group for trigeminal neuralgia (which has been described as the most painful condition in existence) have also adopted the image as a symbol of the condition.
How did Jesus identify the one who would betray him?
In , , and during the meal, Jesus predicted that one of his Apostles would betray him.
Jesus is described as reiterating, despite each Apostle's assertion that he would not betray Jesus, that the betrayer would be one of those who were present, and saying that there would be "woe to the man who betrays the Son of man!
It would be better for him if he had not been born."
In and , Judas is specifically identified as the traitor.
In the Gospel of John, when asked about the traitor, Jesus states: “It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.” Then, dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.
As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him."
What did Grant Wool make a sketch of after getting permission from the Jones Family?
In August 1930, Grant Wood, an American painter with European training, was driven around Eldon, Iowa by a young painter from Eldon, John Sharp, looking for inspiration.
Wood noticed the Dibble House, a small white house built in the Carpenter Gothic architectural style.
Sharp's brother suggested in 1973 that it was on this drive that Wood first sketched the house on the back of an envelope.
Wood's earliest biographer, Darrell Garwood, noted that Wood "thought it a form of borrowed pretentiousness, a structural absurdity, to put a Gothic-style window in such a flimsy frame house."
At the time, Wood classified it as one of the "cardboardy frame houses on Iowa farms" and considered it "very paintable".
After obtaining permission from the Jones family, the house's owners, Wood made a sketch the next day in oil on paperboard from the house's front yard.
This sketch displayed a steeper roof and a longer window with a more pronounced ogive than on the actual house, features which eventually adorned the final work.Wood decided to paint the house along with "the kind of people I fancied should live in that house."
He recruited his sister Nan (1899–1990) to model the woman, dressing her in a colonial print apron mimicking 19th-century Americana.
The man is modeled on Wood's dentist, Dr. Byron McKeeby (1867–1950) from Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
The three-pronged hay fork is echoed in the stitching of the man's overalls, the Gothic window of the house, and the structure of the man's face.
However, Wood did not add figures to his sketch until he returned to his studio in Cedar Rapids.
He would not return to Eldon again before his death in 1942, although he did request a photograph of the home to complete his painting.
What color scheme does the border of the painting have?
Seurat's painting was a mirror of "Bathers at Asnières", completed shortly before in 1884.
While the bathers are doused in light, almost every figure on "La Grande Jatte" appears to be cast in shadow, either under trees or an umbrella, or from another person.
Some of the characters are doing curious things.
The lady on the right hand side has a monkey on a leash.
A lady on the left near the river bank is fishing.
The area was known at the time as being a place to procure prostitutes among the bourgeousie, a likely allusion of the otherwise odd "fishing" rod.
In the painting's center stands a little girl dressed in white (who is not in a shadow), who stares directly at the viewer of the painting.
This may be interpreted as someone who is silently questioning the audience, "what will become of these people, and their class?"
Seurat paints their prospects bleakly, cloaked as they are in shadow and suspicion of sin.
The border of the painting is, unusually, in inverted color, as if the world around them is also slowly inverting from the way of life they have known.
Seen in this context, the boy who bathes on the other side of the river bank at Asnières appears to be calling out to them, as if to say "we are the future, come and join us".
When did the rose period end?
The Rose Period (1904–1906) is characterised by a more cheery style with orange and pink colours, and featuring many circus people, acrobats and harlequins known in France as saltimbanques.
The harlequin, a comedic character usually depicted in checkered patterned clothing, became a personal symbol for Picasso.
Picasso met Fernande Olivier, a bohemian artist who became his mistress, in Paris in 1904.
Olivier appears in many of his Rose Period paintings, many of which are influenced by his warm relationship with her, in addition to his increased exposure to French painting.
The generally upbeat and optimistic mood of paintings in this period is reminiscent of the 1899–1901 period (i.e.
just prior to the Blue Period) and 1904 can be considered a transition year between the two periods.By 1905, Picasso became a favourite of American art collectors Leo and Gertrude Stein.
Their older brother Michael Stein and his wife Sarah also became collectors of his work.
Picasso painted portraits of both Gertrude Stein and her nephew Allan Stein.
Gertrude Stein became Picasso's principal patron, acquiring his drawings and paintings and exhibiting them in her informal "Salon" at her home in Paris.
At one of her gatherings in 1905, he met Henri Matisse, who was to become a lifelong friend and rival.
The Steins introduced him to Claribel Cone and her sister Etta who were American art collectors; they also began to acquire Picasso and Matisse's paintings.
Eventually Leo Stein moved to Italy.
Michael and Sarah Stein became patrons of Matisse, while Gertrude Stein continued to collect Picasso.In 1907 Picasso joined an art gallery that had recently been opened in Paris by Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler.
Kahnweiler was a German art historian and art collector who became one of the premier French art dealers of the 20th century.
He was among the first champions of Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque and the Cubism that they jointly developed.
Kahnweiler promoted burgeoning artists such as André Derain, Kees van Dongen, Fernand Léger, Juan Gris, Maurice de Vlaminck and several others who had come from all over the globe to live and work in Montparnasse at the time.
Which painting shows soldiers busying themselves about their assigned duty of digging a post hole and raising the cross while various people look on and discuss the events?
Michelangelo's relief of the "Battle of the Centaurs", created while he was still a youth associated with the Medici Academy, is an unusually complex relief in that it shows a great number of figures involved in a vigorous struggle.
Such a complex disarray of figures was rare in Florentine art, where it would usually only be found in images showing either the Massacre of the Innocents or the Torments of Hell.
The relief treatment, in which some of the figures are boldly projecting, may indicate Michelangelo's familiarity with Roman sarcophagus reliefs from the collection of Lorenzo Medici, and similar marble panels created by Nicola and Giovanni Pisano, and with the figurative compositions on Ghiberti's Baptistry Doors.The composition of the "Battle of Cascina", is known in its entirety only from copies, as the original cartoon, according to Vasari, was so admired that it deteriorated and was eventually in pieces.
It reflects the earlier relief in the energy and diversity of the figures, with many different postures, and many being viewed from the back, as they turn toward the approaching enemy and prepare for battle.In "The Last Judgement" it is said that Michelangelo drew inspiration from a fresco by Melozzo da Forli in the Church of the Holy Apostles, Rome.
While the work is very different in character to Michelangelo's, Melozzo had depicting figures from different angles, as if they were floating in the Heaven and seen from below.
Melozzo's majestic figure of Christ, with windblown cloak, demonstrates a degree of foreshortening of the figure that had also been employed by Andrea Mantegna, but was not usual in the frescos of Florentine painters.
In "The Last Judgement" Michelangelo had the opportunity to depict, on an unprecedented scale, figures in the action of either rising heavenward or falling and being dragged down.In the two frescos of the Pauline Chapel, the "Crucifixion of Peter" and the "Conversion of Paul", Michelangelo has used the various groups of figures to convey a complex narrative.
In the "Crucifixion of Peter" soldiers busy themselves about their assigned duty of digging a post hole and raising the cross while various people look on and discuss the events.
A group of horrified women cluster in the foreground, while another group of Christians is led by a tall man to witness the events.
In the right foreground, Michelangelo walks out of the painting with an expression of disillusionment.
What year did da Vinci collaborate with Marcantonio della Torre?
Leonardo's formal training in the anatomy of the human body began with his apprenticeship to Andrea del Verrocchio, who insisted that all his pupils learn anatomy.
As an artist, he quickly became master of "topographic anatomy", drawing many studies of muscles, tendons and other visible anatomical features.As a successful artist, he was given permission to dissect human corpses at the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence and later at hospitals in Milan and Rome.
From 1510 to 1511 he collaborated in his studies with the doctor Marcantonio della Torre.
Leonardo made over 240 detailed drawings and wrote about 13,000 words towards a treatise on anatomy.
These papers were left to his heir, Francesco Melzi, for publication, a task of overwhelming difficulty because of its scope and Leonardo's idiosyncratic writing.
It was left incomplete at the time of Melzi's death more than fifty years later, with only a small amount of the material on anatomy included in Leonardo's "Treatise on painting", published in France in 1632.
During the time that Melzi was ordering the material into chapters for publication, they were examined by a number of anatomists and artists, including Vasari, Cellini and Albrecht Dürer who made a number of drawings from them.Leonardo's anatomical drawings include many studies of the human skeleton and its parts, and studies muscles and sinews.
He studied the mechanical functions of the skeleton and the muscular forces that are applied to it in a manner that prefigured the modern science of biomechanics.
He drew the heart and vascular system, the sex organs and other internal organs, making one of the first scientific drawings of a fetus "in utero".
The drawings and notation are far ahead of their time, and if published, would undoubtedly have made a major contribution to medical science.As an artist, Leonardo also closely observed and recorded the effects of age and of human emotion on the physiology, studying in particular the effects of rage.
He also drew many figures who had significant facial deformities or signs of illness.
Leonardo also studied and drew the anatomy of many animals, dissecting cows, birds, monkeys, bears, and frogs, and comparing in his drawings their anatomical structure with that of humans.
He also made a number of studies of horses.
In what year did Donatello return to Florence?
Donatello returned to Florence in 1453.
The Judith and Holofernes, begun for the Duomo di Siena date from 1455 to 1460 but were later acquired by the Medici.
Until 1461, Donatello remained in Siena, where he created a "St. John the Baptist", also for the Duomo, and models for its gates, now lost.For his last commission in Florence, Donatello produced reliefs for the bronze pulpits in the church of San Lorenzo, with help from students Bartolomeo Bellano and Bertoldo di Giovanni.
Donatello provided the general design and personally executed the "Martyrdom of St. Lawrence" and the "Deposition from the Cross"; he worked on the reliefs of "Christ before Pilate" and "Christ before Caiphus", with Bellano.
This work is characterized by an intense, free, indeed sketchy and suggestively unfinished — in Italian a "non-finito" — technique that heightens the dramatic effect of the scenes and emphasizes their spiritual intensity.
Donatello died in Florence in 1466 and was buried in the Basilica of San Lorenzo, next to Cosimo de' Medici the Elder.
What year did Henry Spencer Moore pass away?
Henry Spencer Moore (30 July 1898 – 31 August 1986) was an English sculptor and artist.
He was best known for his semi-abstract monumental bronze sculptures which are located around the world as public works of art.His forms are usually abstractions of the human figure, typically depicting mother-and-child or reclining figures.
Moore's works are usually suggestive of the female body, apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups.
His forms are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces.
Many interpreters liken the undulating form of his reclining figures to the landscape and hills of his birthplace, Yorkshire.Moore was born in Castleford, the son of a coal miner.
He became well-known through his carved marble and larger-scale abstract cast bronze sculptures, and was instrumental in introducing a particular form of modernism to the United Kingdom.
His ability in later life to fulfill large-scale commissions made him exceptionally wealthy.
Yet he lived frugally and most of the money he earned went towards endowing the Henry Moore Foundation, which continues to support education and promotion of the arts.
What year did Andy Warhol move to New York City?
Early life (1928–1949).Andy Warhol (né Andrej Varhola, Jr.) was born on August 6, 1928 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
He was the fourth child of Andrej Varhola (Americanized as Andrew Warhola, Sr., 1889–1942) and Júlia (née Zavacká, 1892–1972), whose first child was born in their homeland and died before their move to the U.S. Andy had two older brothers, Paul (born June 26, 1922) and John Warhola (May 31, 1925 – December 24, 2010).His parents were working-class Lemko emigrants from Mikó (now called Miková), located in today's northeastern Slovakia, part of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire.
Warhol's father immigrated to the United States in 1914, and his mother joined him in 1921, after the death of Warhol's grandparents.
Warhol's father worked in a coal mine.
The family lived at 55 Beelen Street and later at 3252 Dawson Street in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh.
The family was Byzantine Catholic and attended St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church.
Andy Warhol had two older brothers—Pavol (Paul), the oldest, was born before the family emigrated; Ján was born in Pittsburgh.
Pavol's son, James Warhola, became a successful children's book illustrator.
About 1939, he started to collect autographed cards of film stars.In third grade, Warhol had Sydenham's chorea (also known as St. Vitus' Dance), the nervous system disease that causes involuntary movements of the extremities, which is believed to be a complication of scarlet fever which causes skin pigmentation blotchiness.
He became a hypochondriac, developing a fear of hospitals and doctors.
Often bedridden as a child, he became an outcast at school and bonded with his mother.
At times when he was confined to bed, he drew, listened to the radio and collected pictures of movie stars around his bed.
Warhol later described this period as very important in the development of his personality, skill-set and preferences.
When Warhol was 13, his father died in an accident.As a teenager, Warhol graduated from Schenley High School in 1945.
After graduating from high school, his intentions were to study art education at the University of Pittsburgh in the hope of becoming an art teacher, but his plans changed and he enrolled in the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh, where he studied commercial art.
In 1949, he moved to New York City and began a career in magazine illustration and advertising.
In 1949, he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in pictorial design.
Where did Dali get his idea to have clocks melting?
Dalí employed extensive symbolism in his work.
For instance, the hallmark "melting watches" that first appear in "The Persistence of Memory" suggest Einstein's theory that time is relative and not fixed.
The idea for clocks functioning symbolically in this way came to Dalí when he was staring at a runny piece of Camembert cheese on a hot August day.The elephant is also a recurring image in Dalí's works.
It first appeared in his 1944 work "Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee Around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening".
The elephants, inspired by Gian Lorenzo Bernini's sculpture base in Rome of an elephant carrying an ancient obelisk, are portrayed "with long, multijointed, almost invisible legs of desire" along with obelisks on their backs.
Coupled with the image of their brittle legs, these encumbrances, noted for their phallic overtones, create a sense of phantom reality.
"The elephant is a distortion in space", one analysis explains, "its spindly legs contrasting the idea of weightlessness with structure."
"I am painting pictures which make me die for joy, I am creating with an absolute naturalness, without the slightest aesthetic concern, I am making things that inspire me with a profound emotion and I am trying to paint them honestly."
—Salvador Dalí, in Dawn Ades, "Dalí and Surrealism".The egg is another common Dalíesque image.
He connects the egg to the prenatal and intrauterine, thus using it to symbolize hope and love; it appears in "The Great Masturbator" and "The Metamorphosis of Narcissus".
"The Metamorphosis of Narcissus" also symbolized death and petrification.Various other animals appear throughout his work as well: ants point to death, decay, and immense sexual desire; the snail is connected to the human head (he saw a snail on a bicycle outside Freud's house when he first met Sigmund Freud); and locusts are a symbol of waste and fear.
Is there any way to prove if a suspected Pollock painting is authentic?
In 2003, twenty-four Pollock-esque paintings and drawings were found in a locker in Wainscott, New York.
An inconclusive debate continues about whether or not these works are Pollock originals.
Physicists have argued over whether fractals can be used to authenticate the paintings.
This would require an analysis of geometric consistency of the paint splatters in Pollock's work at a microscopic level, and would be measured against the finding that patterns in Pollock's paintings increased in complexity with time.
Analysis of the synthetic pigments shows that some were not patented until the 1980s, and therefore that it is highly improbable that Pollock could have used such paints.In 2006 a documentary, "Who the *$&% Is Jackson Pollock?"
was made concerning Teri Horton, a truck driver who in 1992 bought an abstract painting for five dollars at a thrift store in California.
This work may be a lost Pollock painting but its authenticity is debated.
Name the The US copyright representative for Les Heritiers Matisse
The first painting of Matisse acquired by a public collection was "Still Life with Geraniums" (1910), exhibited in the Pinakothek der Moderne.His "The Plum Blossoms" (1948) was purchased on 8 September 2005, for the Museum of Modern Art by Henry Kravis and the new president of the museum, Marie-Josée Drouin.
Estimated price was US$25 million.
Previously, it had not been seen by the public since 1970.
In 2002, a Matisse sculpture, "Reclining Nude I (Dawn)," sold for US$9.2 million, a record for a sculpture by the artist.Matisse's daughter Marguerite often aided Matisse scholars with insights about his working methods and his works.
She died in 1982 while compiling a catalogue of her father's work.Matisse's son, Pierre Matisse, (1900–1989) opened a modern art gallery in New York City during the 1930s.
The Pierre Matisse Gallery which was active from 1931 until 1989 represented and exhibited many European artists and a few Americans and Canadians in New York often for the first time.
He exhibited Joan Miró, Marc Chagall, Alberto Giacometti, Jean Dubuffet, André Derain, Yves Tanguy, Le Corbusier, Paul Delvaux, Wifredo Lam, Jean-Paul Riopelle, Balthus, Leonora Carrington, Zao Wou Ki, Sam Francis, sculptors Theodore Roszak, Raymond Mason and Reg Butler, and several other important artists, including the work of Henri Matisse.Henri Matisse's grandson, Paul Matisse, is an artist and inventor living in Massachusetts.
Matisse's great-granddaughter Sophie Matisse is active as an artist.
Les Heritiers Matisse functions as his official Estate.
The US copyright representative for Les Heritiers Matisse is the Artists Rights Society.
What is association football commonly known as?
Association football, commonly known as football or soccer, is a sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball.
It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries, making it the world's most popular sport.
The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end.
The object of the game is to score by using any part of the body besides the arms and hands to get the football into the opposing goal.The goalkeepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with their hands or arms while it is in play and then only in their penalty area.
Outfield players mostly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may use their head or torso to strike the ball instead.
The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins.
If the score is tied at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time and/or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition.
The Laws of the Game were originally codified in England by The Football Association in 1863.
Association football is governed internationally by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA; ) which organises a World Cup every four years.

How long was the average American League game in 1997?
In clock-limited sports, games often end with a team that holds the lead killing the clock rather than competing aggressively against the opposing team.
In contrast, baseball has no clock; a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time.
At almost any turn in any baseball game, the most advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy.
In contrast, again, the clock comes into play even in the case of multi-day Test and first-class cricket: the possibility of a draw often encourages a team that is batting last and well behind to bat defensively, giving up any faint chance at a win to avoid a loss.
Baseball offers no such reward for conservative batting.While nine innings has been the standard since the beginning of professional baseball, the duration of the average major league game has increased steadily through the years.
At the turn of the 20th century, games typically took an hour and a half to play.
In the 1920s, they averaged just less than two hours, which eventually ballooned to 2:38 in 1960.
By 1997, the average American League game lasted 2:57 (National League games were about 10 minutes shorter—pitchers at the plate making for quicker outs than designated hitters).
In 2004, Major League Baseball declared that its goal was an average game of merely 2:45.
The lengthening of games is attributed to longer breaks between half-innings for television commercials, increased offense, more pitching changes, and a slower pace of play with pitchers taking more time between each delivery, and batters stepping out of the box more frequently.
Other leagues have experienced similar issues.
In 2008, Nippon Professional Baseball took steps aimed at shortening games by 12 minutes from the preceding decade's average of 3:18.
How can you earn a one-point shot in Basketball?
Measurements and time limits discussed in this section often vary among tournaments and organizations; international and NBA rules are used in this section.The object of the game is to outscore one's opponents by throwing the ball through the opponents' basket from above while preventing the opponents from doing so on their own.
An attempt to score in this way is called a shot.
A successful shot is worth two points, or three points if it is taken from beyond the three-point arc which is from the basket in international games and in NBA games.
A one-point shot can be earned when shooting from the foul line after a foul is made.
What is the way a racquet is held to hit shots called?
A grip is a way of holding the racquet in order to hit shots during a match.
The grip affects the angle of the racquet face when it hits the ball and influences the pace, spin, and placement of the shot.
Players use various grips during play, including the Continental (The "Handshake Grip"), Eastern (Can be either semi-eastern or full eastern.
Usually used for backhands.
), and Western (semi-western or full western, usually for forehand grips) grips.
Most players change grips during a match depending on what shot they are hitting; for example, slice shots and serves call for a Continental grip.
What keeps the body streamlined and protect the hair from chlorinated water?
 Ear plugs can prevent water from getting in the ears.
 Noseclips can prevent water from getting in the nose.
However, this is generally only used for synchronised swimming.
Using noseclips in competitive swimming can cause a disadvantage to most swimmers.
It is for this reason that noseclips are only used for synchronised swimming and recreational swimming.
 Goggles protect the eyes from chlorinated water, and can improve underwater visibility.
Tinted goggles protect the eyes from sunlight that reflects from the bottom of the pool.
 Swim caps keep the body streamlined and protect the hair from chlorinated water.
 Kickboards are used to keep the upper body afloat while exercising the lower body.
Pull buoys are used to keep the lower body afloat while exercising the upper body.
 Swimfins are used to elongate the kick and improve technique and speed.
Fins also build upper calf muscles.
 Safety fencing and equipment is mandatory at public pools and a zoning requirement at most residential pools in the United States.
Which sport contains Popular formations include the 4-2, 6-2, and 5-1 systems?
Volleyball is essentially a game of transition from one of the above skills to the next, with choreographed team movement between plays on the ball.
These team movements are determined by the teams chosen serve receive system, offensive system, coverage system, and defensive system.The serve receive system is the formation used by the receiving team to attempt to pass the ball to the designated setter.
Systems can consist of 5 receivers, 4 receivers, 3 receivers, and in some cases 2 receivers.
The most popular formation at higher levels is a 3 receiver formation consisting of two left sides and a libero receiving every rotation.
This allows middles and right sides to become more specialized at hitting and blocking.Offensive systems are the formations used by the offense to attempt to ground the ball into the opposing court (or otherwise score points).
Formations often include designated player positions with skill specialization (see "Player specialization", below).
Popular formations include the 4-2, 6-2, and 5-1 systems (see "Formations", below).
There are also several different attacking schemes teams can use to keep the opposing defense off balance.Coverage systems are the formations used by the offense to protect their court in the case of a blocked attack.
Executed by the 5 offensive players not directly attacking the ball, players move to assigned positions around the attacker to dig up any ball that deflects off the block back into their own court.
Popular formations include the 2-3 system and the 1-2-2 system.
In lieu of a system, some teams just use a random coverage with the players nearest the hitter.Defensive systems are the formations used by the defense to protect against the ball being grounded into their court by the opposing team.
The system will outline which players are responsible for which areas of the court depending on where the opposing team is attacking from.
Popular systems include the 6-Up, 6-Back-Deep, and 6-Back-Slide defense.
There are also several different blocking schemes teams can employ to disrupt the opposing teams offense.Some teams, when they are ready to serve, will line up their other five players in a screen to obscure the view of the receiving team.
This action is only illegal if the server makes use of the screen, so the call is made at the referees discretion as to the impact the screen made on the receivers ability to pass the ball.
The most common style of screening involves a W formation designed to take up as much horizontal space as possible.
Who wins under the sudden death rule in a playoff?
In stroke play, the score achieved for each and every hole of the round or tournament is added to produce the total score, and the player with the lowest score wins.
Stroke play is the game most commonly played by professional golfers.
If there is a tie after the regulation number of holes in a professional tournament, a playoff takes place between all tied players.
Playoffs either are sudden death or employ a pre-determined number of holes, anywhere from three to a full 18.
In sudden death, a player who scores lower on a hole than all of his opponents wins the match.
If at least two players remain tied after such a playoff using a pre-determined number of holes, then play continues in sudden death format, where the first player to win a hole wins the tournament.
What is the ideal position in mixed doubles?
In mixed doubles, both pairs typically try to maintain an attacking formation with the woman at the front and the man at the back.
This is because the male players are usually substantially stronger, and can therefore produce smashes that are more powerful.
As a result, mixed doubles require greater tactical awareness and subtler positional play.
Clever opponents will try to reverse the ideal position, by forcing the woman towards the back or the man towards the front.
In order to protect against this danger, mixed players must be careful and systematic in their shot selection.At high levels of play, the formations will generally be more flexible: the top women players are capable of playing powerfully from the back-court, and will happily do so if required.
When the opportunity arises, however, the pair will switch back to the standard mixed attacking position, with the woman in front and men in the back.
What equipment is used in Alpine snowboarding?
Sometimes called freecarving, this takes place on hard packed snow or groomed runs and focuses on carving linked turns, much like surfing or longboarding.
Little or no jumping takes place in this discipline.
Alpine Snowboarding consists of a small portion of the general snowboard population, that has a well connected social community and its own specific board manufacturers.
Alpine Snowboard equipment is a ski-like hardshell boot and plate binding system with a true directional snowboard that is stiffer and narrower to manage linking turns with greater forces and speed.
Shaped skis can thank these "freecarve" snowboards for the cutting-edge technology leading to their creation.
Highlights of alpine snowboarding includes a unique sensation felt through each carved turn.
A skilled alpine snowboarder can link numerous turns into a run placing their body very close to the ground each turn, similar to a motogp turn or waterski carve.
Depending on factors including stiffness, turning radius and personality this can be done slowly or fast.Carvers make perfect half-circles out of each turn, changing edges when the snowboard is perpendicular to the fall line and starting every turn on the downhill edge.
Carving on a snowboard is like riding a roller coaster, because the board will lock into a turn radius and provide what feels like multiple Gs of acceleration.
What is similar to wheelchair fencing but for the able bodied?
Other variants include chair fencing, "one-hit épée" (one of the five events which constitute modern pentathlon) and the various types of non-Olympic competitive fencing.
Chair fencing is similar to wheelchair fencing but for the able bodied.
The opponents set up opposing chairs and fence while seated; all the usual rules of fencing are applied.
An example of the latter is the American Fencing League (distinct from the United States Fencing Association): the format of competitions is different and the right of way rules are interpreted in a different way.
In a number of countries, school and university matches deviate slightly from the FIE format.
What type of bow is more useful when on horseback?
Central Asian tribesmen (after the domestication of the horse) and American Plains Indians (after gaining access to horses) became extremely adept at archery on horseback.
Lightly armoured, but highly mobile archers were excellently suited to warfare in the Central Asian steppes, and they formed a large part of armies that repeatedly conquered large areas of Eurasia.
Shorter bows are more suited to use on horseback, and the composite bow enabled mounted archers to use powerful weapons.
Empires throughout the Eurasian landmass often strongly associated their respective "barbarian" counterparts with the usage of the bow and arrow, to the point where powerful states like the Han Dynasty referred to their neighbours, the Xiong-nu, as "Those Who Draw the Bow" For example, Xiong-nu mounted bowmen made them more than a match for the Han military, and their threat was at least partially responsible for Chinese expansion into the Ordos region, to create a stronger, more powerful buffer zone against them.
It is possible that "barbarian" peoples were responsible for introducing archery or certain types of bows to their "civilized" counterparts—the Xiong-nu and the Han being one example.
Similarly, short bows seem to have been introduced to Japan by northeast Asian groups.
What is another name for Mexican professional wrestling?
Mexican professional wrestling, also known as "Lucha libre" is a style of wrestling that combines mixed-martial arts and the wrestling of North America.
In Lucha libre the wrestler or "luchador" uses a mask to cover his face.
Traditionally the match is for the best of three rounds without a time limit.
The "Luchador" or "wrestler" athlete uses their own wrestling style or "estilo de lucha" consisting of aerial attack wrestling moves, strikes and complex submission moves.
The most popular "luchadores" are Santo, Blue Demon, Rey Mysterio, Eddie Guerrero, La Parka, Dos Caras Jr./Alberto Del Rio and Mistico.
What is an advantage of counter hitting?
Counter punchers are slippery, defensive style fighters who often rely on their opponent's mistakes in order to gain the advantage, whether it be on the score cards or more preferably a knockout.
They use their well-rounded defense to avoid or block shots and then immediately catch the opponent off guard with a well placed and timed punch.
A fight with a skilled counter-puncher can turn into a war of attrition, where each shot landed is a battle in itself.
Thus, fighting against counter punchers requires constant feinting and the ability to avoid telegraphing ones attacks.
To be truly successful using this style they must have good reflexes, a high level of prediction and awareness, pinpoint accuracy and speed, both in striking and in footwork.Notable counter punchers include Vitali Klitschko, Floyd Mayweather, Jr., Evander Holyfield, Max Schmeling, Chris Byrd, Jim Corbett, Jack Johnson, Bernard Hopkins, Laszlo Papp, Jerry Quarry, Anselmo Moreno, James Toney, Marvin Hagler, Juan Manuel Márquez, Humberto Soto, Roger Mayweather, Pernell Whitaker and Sergio Gabriel Martinez.Counter punchers usually wear their opponents down by causing them to miss their punches.
The more the opponent misses, the faster they'll tire, and the psychological effects of being unable to land a hit will start to sink in.
The counter puncher often tries to outplay their opponent entirely, not just in a physical sense, but also in a mental and emotional sense.
This style can be incredibly difficult, especially against seasoned fighters, but winning a fight without getting hit is often worth the pay-off.
They usually try to stay away from the center of the ring, in order to outmaneuver and chip away at their opponents.
A large advantage in counter-hitting is the forward momentum of the attacker, which drives them further into your return strike.
As such, knockouts are more common than one would expect from a defensive style.
When did the modern Olympics began?
When the modern Olympics began in 1896, the initiators and organizers were looking for a great popularizing event, recalling the ancient glory of Greece.
The idea of a marathon race came from Michel Bréal, who wanted the event to feature in the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens.
This idea was heavily supported by Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympics, as well as by the Greeks.
The Greeks staged a selection race for the Olympic marathon on 10 March 1896 that was won by Charilaos Vasilakos in 3 hours and 18 minutes (with the future winner of the introductory Olympic Games marathon coming in fifth).
The winner of the first Olympic Marathon, on 10 April 1896 (a male-only race), was Spyridon "Spyros" Louis, a Greek water-carrier, in 2 hours 58 minutes and 50 seconds.The women's marathon was introduced at the 1984 Summer Olympics (Los Angeles, USA) and was won by Joan Benoit of the United States with a time of 2 hours 24 minutes and 52 seconds.Since the modern games were founded, it has become a tradition for the men's Olympic marathon to be the last event of the athletics calendar, with a finish inside the Olympic stadium, often within hours of, or even incorporated into, the closing ceremonies.
The marathon of the 2004 Summer Olympics revived the traditional route from Marathon to Athens, ending at Panathinaiko Stadium, the venue for the 1896 Summer Olympics.The Olympic men's record is 2:06:32, set at the 2008 Summer Olympics by Samuel Kamau Wanjiru of Kenya (average speed about 20.01 km/hr).
The Olympic women's record is 2:23:07, set at the 2012 Summer Olympics by Tiki Gelana of Ethiopia.
The men's London 2012 Summer Olympic marathon winner was Stephen Kiprotich of Uganda (2:08:01).
Per capita, the Great Rift Valley, Kenya has produced a large number of elite marathon runners, helped by the high altitude.
How many main styles of taekwondo are there?
Taekwondo or (Korean 태권도 (hangul) / 跆拳道 (hanja), ) is a Korean martial art.
It combines combat and self-defense techniques with sport and exercise.
"Gyeorugi" (), a type of sparring, has been an Olympic event since 2000.
Taekwondo was developed by a variety of Korean masters during the 1940s as partial combination of taekkyeon, Okinawan karate, and other traditions.The name "taekwondo" was coined by Choi Hong Hi (of the Oh Do Kwan).
The World Taekwondo Federation claims that taekwondo development was a collaborative effort by a council consisting of members from the nine original kwans, while the International Taekwon-Do Federation credits Choi Hong Hi solely.
"Traditional taekwondo" typically refers to the martial art as it was established in the 1950s and 1960s in the South Korean military and in various civilian organizations, including schools and universities.
In particular, the names and symbolism of the both the traditional patterns and the newer poomsae often refer to elements of Korean history, culture and religious philosophy.
This symbolism is replicated in the Korean flag.
"Sport taekwondo" was developed in the 1950s and may have a somewhat different focus, especially in terms of its emphasis on speed and competition (as in Olympic sparring).
Sport taekwondo is in turn subdivided into two main styles.
One style is practiced by International Taekwon-Do adherents and was created in 1955 by Choi Hong Hi.
The other style derives from Kukkiwon, the source of the sparring system "sihap gyeorugi".
This style is now an event at the summer Olympic Games and is governed by the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF).
Kukkiwon (World Taekwondo Headquarters) is the traditional center for WTF taekwondo and was founded in 1973 by Dr. Kim Un Yong.Although there are doctrinal and technical differences between sparring in the two main styles and among the various organizations, the art in general emphasizes kicks and punches thrown from a mobile stance.
Taekwondo training generally includes a system of blocks, kicks, punches, and open-handed strikes and may also include various take-downs or sweeps, throws, and joint locks.
Pressure points, known as "jiapsul", are used, as well as grabbing self-defense techniques borrowed from other martial arts such as Japanese judo, Korean hapkido, and Korean wrestling or ssireum.In Korean, "tae" (태, ) means "to strike or break with the foot"; "kwon" (권, ) means "to strike or break with the fist"; and "do" (도, ) means "way of life".
Thus, "taekwondo" may be loosely translated as "the way of the foot and the hand."
The name "taekwondo" is also written as "taekwon-do", "tae kwon-do", or "tae kwon do" by various organizations.
When was the International Judo Federation(IJF) Founded?
The international governing body for judo is the International Judo Federation (IJF), founded in 1951.
Members of the IJF include the African Judo Union (AJU), the Pan-American Judo Confederation (PJC), the Judo Union of Asia (JUA), the European Judo Union (EJU) and the Oceania Judo Union (OJU), each comprising a number of national judo associations.
The IJF is responsible for organising international competition and hosts the World Judo Championships and is involved in running the Olympic Judo events.
To impart a spin on the ball which is parallel to its trajectory, how must the racket be swung?
This type of spin is almost exclusively employed in service, but it is also used from time to time in the lob at the professional level.
Unlike any of the aforementioned techniques, corkspin (sometimes referred to as "drill-spin") features a unique situation in which the axis of spin is more or less parallel to the trajectory of the ball.
This means that the Magnus effect will have little to no effect on the trajectory of a cork-spun ball.
Upon bouncing, the ball will dart right or left, depending on the direction of the spin, making it very difficult to return.
Although in theory this type of spin produces the most obnoxious effects, it is not as strategically practical as sidespin or backspin in terms of the limitations that it imposes upon the opponent during their return.
Aside from the initial direction change when bouncing, provided that it does not exceed the reach of the opponent, a cork-spun ball is easily countered with topspin "or" backspin.
Similar to a backspin stroke, the corkspin stroke has a lower maximum velocity, simply due to the contact angle of the racket when producing the stroke.
To impart a spin on the ball which is parallel to its trajectory, the racket must be swung more or less perpendicular to the trajectory of the ball.
This greatly limits the amount of forward momentum that can be transferred to the ball by the racket.
Corkspin is almost always mixed with another variety of spin, as it is less effective and harder to produce on its own.
Where do most countries have embassies in the US?
The United States has an established structure of foreign relations.
It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and New York City is home to the United Nations Headquarters.
It is a member of the G8, G20, and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
Almost all countries have embassies in Washington, D.C., and many have consulates around the country.
Likewise, nearly all nations host American diplomatic missions.
However, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Bhutan, and the Republic of China (Taiwan) do not have formal diplomatic relations with the United States (although the U.S. still supplies Taiwan with military equipment).The United States has a "special relationship" with the United Kingdom and strong ties with Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Japan, South Korea, Israel, and several European countries, including France and Germany.
It works closely with fellow NATO members on military and security issues and with its neighbors through the Organization of American States and free trade agreements such as the trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.
In 2008, the United States spent a net $25.4 billion on official development assistance, the most in the world.
As a share of America's large gross national income (GNI), however, the U.S. contribution of 0.18% ranked last among 22 donor states.
By contrast, private overseas giving by Americans is relatively generous.The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for three sovereign nations through Compact of Free Association with Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau, all of which are Pacific island nations which were part of the U.S.-administered Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands beginning after World War II, and gained independence in subsequent years.
What year did Russia begin using Chinese renminbi in it's trade?
In November 2010, Russia began using the Chinese renminbi in its bilateral trade with China.
This was soon followed by Japan, Australia, Singapore, and the United Kingdom.
As a result of the rapid internationalization of the renminbi, it became the eighth-most-traded currency in the world in 2013.
how many rubles does the Russian government plan to allocate to develop the next generation of nuclear energy technology?
In recent years, Russia has frequently been described in the media as an energy superpower.
The country has the world's largest natural gas reserves, the 8th largest oil reserves, and the second largest coal reserves.
Russia is the world's leading natural gas exporter and second largest natural gas producer, while also the largest oil exporter and the largest oil producer.
On 1 January 2011, Russia said it had begun scheduled oil shipments to China, with the plan to increase the rate up to 300,000 barrels per day in 2011.Russia is the 3rd largest electricity producer in the world and the 5th largest renewable energy producer, the latter because of the well-developed hydroelectricity production in the country.
Large cascades of hydropower plants are built in European Russia along big rivers like Volga.
The Asian part of Russia also features a number of major hydropower stations, however the gigantic hydroelectric potential of Siberia and the Russian Far East largely remains unexploited.Russia was the first country to develop civilian nuclear power and to construct the world's first nuclear power plant.
Currently the country is the 4th largest nuclear energy producer, with all nuclear power in Russia being managed by Rosatom State Corporation.
The sector is rapidly developing, with an aim of increasing the total share of nuclear energy from current 16.9% to 23% by 2020.
The Russian government plans to allocate 127 billion rubles ($5.42 billion) to a federal program dedicated to the next generation of nuclear energy technology.
About 1 trillion rubles ($42.7 billion) is to be allocated from the federal budget to nuclear power and industry development before 2015.
What is the highest court for criminal and civil cases in England and Wales?
The English law legal system, developed over the centuries, is the basis of common law legal systems used in most Commonwealth countries and the United States (except Louisiana).
Despite now being part of the United Kingdom, the legal system of the Courts of England and Wales continued, under the Treaty of Union, as a separate legal system from the one used in Scotland.
The general essence of English law is that it is made by judges sitting in courts, applying their common sense and knowledge of legal precedent—"stare decisis"—to the facts before them.The court system is headed by the Senior Courts of England and Wales, consisting of the Court of Appeal, the High Court of Justice for civil cases, and the Crown Court for criminal cases.
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom is the highest court for criminal and civil cases in England and Wales.
It was created in 2009 after constitutional changes, taking over the judicial functions of the House of Lords.
A decision of the Supreme Court is binding on every other court in the hierarchy, which must follow its directions.Crime increased between 1981 and 1995, but fell by 42% in the period 1995–2006.
The prison population doubled over the same period, giving it the highest incarceration rate in Western Europe at 147 per 100,000.
Her Majesty's Prison Service, reporting to the Ministry of Justice, manages most prisons, housing over 85,000 convicts.
How many administrative regions is France divided into?
France is divided into 27 administrative regions, 22 in metropolitan France (including the territorial collectivity of Corsica), and five located overseas.
The regions are further subdivided into 101 departments, which are numbered mainly alphabetically.
This number is used in postal codes and vehicle number plates amongst others.The 101 departments are subdivided into 341 arrondissements which are, in turn, subdivided into 4,051 cantons.
These cantons are then divided into 36,697 communes, which are municipalities with an elected municipal council.
There are 2,588 intercommunal entities grouping 33,414 of the 36,697 communes (i.e.
91.1% of all the communes).
Three communes, Paris, Lyon and Marseille are subdivided into 45 municipal arrondissements.The regions, departments and communes are all known as territorial collectivities, meaning they possess local assemblies as well as an executive.
Arrondissements and cantons are merely administrative divisions.
However, this was not always the case.
Until 1940, the arrondissements were territorial collectivities with an elected assembly, but these were suspended by the Vichy regime and definitely abolished by the Fourth Republic in 1946.
Freedom of religion is guaranteed by what?
As of 2005, just under half of the South Korean population expressed no religious preference.
Of the rest, most are Buddhist or Christian.
According to the 2007 census, 29.2% of the population at that time was Christian (18.3% identified themselves as Protestants, 10.9% as Roman Catholics), and 22.8% were Buddhist.
Other religions include Islam and various new religious movements such as Jeungsanism, Cheondoism and Wonbuddhism.
The earliest religion practiced was Korean shamanism.
Today, freedom of religion is guaranteed by the constitution, and there is no state religion.Christianity is South Korea's largest religion, accounting for more than half of all South Korean religious adherents.
There are approximately 13.7 million Christians in South Korea today, about 63% of Christians belong to Protestant churches, while about 37% belong to the Roman Catholic Church.
The number of Protestant Christians have slowly decreased since 1990s, while the number of Roman Catholics has rapidly increased since 1980s.
Presbyterian denominations are the biggest Christian denominations in South Korea.
About 9 million people belongs to the 100 different Presbyterian churches, among the biggest denominations are the Presbyterian Church in Korea (HapDong), Presbyterian Church in Korea (TongHap), the Presbyterian Church in Korea (Koshin).
For more information see Presbyterianism in South Korea.
South Korea is also the second-largest missionary-sending nation, after the United States.Buddhism was introduced to Korea in the year 372.
According to the national census as of 2005, South Korea has over Buddhists.
Today, about 90% of Korean Buddhists belong to Jogye Order.
Most of the National Treasures of South Korea are Buddhist artifacts.
Buddhism became the state religion in some of Korean kingdoms since the Three Kingdoms Period, when Goguryeo adopted it as the state religion in 372, followed by Baekche (528).
Buddhism had been the state religion of Unified Korea from North South States Period (not to be confused with the modern division of Korea) to Goryeo before suppression under the Joseon Dynasty in favor of Neo-Confucianism.Fewer than 30,000 South Koreans are thought to be Muslims, but the country has some 100,000 resident foreign workers from Muslim countries, Bangladesh and Pakistan.Korean shamanism, today known as Muism (religion of the mu ) or Sinism (religion of the gods) encompasses a variety of indigenous religious beliefs and practices of the Korean people and the Korean sphere.
In contemporary South Korea, the most used term is "Muism" and a shaman is known as a "mudang" (, ) or Tangol (당골).
Since the early 2000s, this religion has regained popularity among Koreans.

Sixteen sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, twelve of which are of cultural significance.
In what time period were the foundations of Hindu literature laid?
Indian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years.
During the Vedic period (c. 1700 – 500 BCE), the foundations of Hindu philosophy, mythology, and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as "dhárma", "kárma", "yóga", and "mokṣa", were established.
India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation's major religions.
The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the "Upanishads", the "Yoga Sutras", the "Bhakti" movement, and by Buddhist philosophy.
How many active volcanoes does Indonesia have?
Indonesia lies between latitudes 11°S and 6°N, and longitudes 95°E and 141°E.
It consists of 17,508 islands, about 6,000 of which are inhabited.
These are scattered over both sides of the equator.
The largest are Java, Sumatra, Borneo (shared with Brunei and Malaysia), New Guinea (shared with Papua New Guinea), and Sulawesi.
Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on Borneo, Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea, and East Timor on the island of Timor.
Indonesia shares maritime borders across narrow straits with Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Palau to the north, and with Australia to the south.
The capital, Jakarta, is on Java and is the nation's largest city, followed by Surabaya, Bandung, Medan, and Semarang.At 1,919,440 square kilometers (741,050 sq mi), Indonesia is the world's 15th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area.
Its average population density is 134 people per square kilometer (347 per sq mi), 79th in the world, although Java, the world's most populous island, has a population density of 940 people per square kilometer (2,435 per sq mi).
At , Puncak Jaya in Papua is Indonesia's highest peak, and Lake Toba in Sumatra its largest lake, with an area of 1,145 square kilometers (442 sq mi).
The country's largest rivers are in Kalimantan, and include the Mahakam and Barito; such rivers are communication and transport links between the island's river settlements.Indonesia's location on the edges of the Pacific, Eurasian, and Australian tectonic plates makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes.
Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes, including Krakatoa and Tambora, both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century.
The eruption of the Toba supervolcano, approximately 70,000 years ago, was one of the largest eruptions ever, and a global catastrophe.
Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra, and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006.
However, volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali.Lying along the equator, Indonesia has a tropical climate, with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons.
Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from , and up to in mountainous regions.
Mountainous areas – particularly in the west coast of Sumatra, West Java, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Papua – receive the highest rainfall.
Humidity is generally high, averaging about 80%.
Temperatures vary little throughout the year; the average daily temperature range of Jakarta is .
What is Brazil's official name?
Brazil (, ), officially the Federative Republic of Brazil (, ), is the largest country in both South America and the Latin American region.
It is the world's fifth largest country, both by geographical area and by population.
It is the largest Lusophone country in the world, and the only one in the Americas.Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of .
It is bordered on the north by Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and the French overseas region of French Guiana; on the northwest by Colombia; on the west by Bolivia and Peru; on the southwest by Argentina and Paraguay and on the south by Uruguay.
Numerous archipelagos form part of Brazilian territory, such as Fernando de Noronha, Rocas Atoll, Saint Peter and Paul Rocks, and Trindade and Martim Vaz.
It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and occupies 47 percent of the continent of South America.Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing of explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral in 1500, who claimed the area for Portugal.
Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808, when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro after French forces led by Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Portugal.
In 1815, it was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves.
Its independence was achieved in 1822 with the creation of the Empire of Brazil, a unitary state governed under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system.
The country became a presidential republic in 1889, when a military "coup d'état" proclaimed the Republic, although the bicameral legislature, now called Congress, dates back to the ratification of the first constitution in 1824.
An authoritarian military junta had led the nation from 1964 until 1985.
Brazil's current Constitution, formulated in 1988, defines it as a federal republic.
The Federation is composed of the union of the Federal District, the 26 states, and the 5,564 municipalities.The Brazilian economy is the world's seventh largest by nominal GDP and the seventh largest by purchasing power parity, as of 2012.
A member of the BRIC group, Brazil has one of the world's fastest growing major economies, with its economic reforms giving the country new international recognition and influence.
Brazil's national development bank (BNDES) plays an important role for the country's economic growth.
Brazil is a founding member of the United Nations, the G20, CPLP, Latin Union, the Organization of Ibero-American States, the Organization of American States, Mercosul and the Union of South American Nations.
Brazil is one of 17 megadiverse countries, home to a variety of wildlife, natural environments, and extensive natural resources in a variety of protected habitats.
Brazil is a regional power in Latin America and a middle power in international affairs, with some analysts identifying it as an emerging global power.
Brazil has been the world's largest producer of coffee for the last 150 years.
On what legal grounds does India claim the region of Kashmir?
The Kashmir conflict is a territorial dispute between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir region, the most northwesterly region of South Asia.
The two countries have fought at least three wars over Kashmir—the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, 1965, 1971 and 1999—and several skirmishes over the Siachen Glacier.
India claims the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir and administers approximately 45.1% of the region, including most of Jammu, the Kashmir Valley, Ladakh, and the Siachen Glacier.
India's claim is contested by Pakistan, which controls approximately 38.2% of Kashmir, consisting of Azad Kashmir and the northern areas of Gilgit and Baltistan.The conflict of Kashmir has its origin in 1947, when British India was separated into the two states of Pakistan and India.
As part of the partition process, both countries had agreed that the rulers of princely states would be allowed to opt for membership of either Pakistan or India, or in special cases to remain independent.
India claims Kashmir on the basis of the Instrument of Accession, a legal agreement with Kashmir's leaders executed by Maharaja Hari Singh, then ruler of Kashmir, agreeing to accede the area to India.
Pakistan claims Kashmir on the basis of a Muslim majority and of geography, the same principles that were applied for the creation of the two independent states.
India referred the dispute to the United Nations on 1 January 1948.
In a resolution in 1948, the UN asked Pakistan to remove most of its troops.
A plebiscite would then be held.
However, Pakistan failed to vacate the region.
A ceasefire was reached in 1949 and a Line of Control was established, dividing Kashmir between the two countries.Pakistan's position is that the people of Jammu and Kashmir have the right to determine their future through impartial elections as mandated by the United Nations.
India has stated that it believes that Kashmir is an integral part of India, referring to the 1972 Simla Agreement and to the fact that elections take place regularly.
Certain Kashmiri independence groups believe that Kashmir should be independent of both India and Pakistan.
Where do most minorities in Nigeria reside?
Nigeria has more than 250 ethnic groups, with varying languages and customs, creating a country of rich ethnic diversity.
The largest ethnic groups are the Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo and Fulani, accounting for more than 70% of the population, while the Edo, Ijaw, Kanuri, Ibibio, Ebira, Nupe, Gwari, Itsekiri, Jukun, Urhobo, Igala, Idoma and Tiv comprise between 25 and 30%; other minorities make up the remaining 5%.The middle belt of Nigeria is known for its diversity of ethnic groups, including the Pyem, Goemai, and Kofyar.
The official population count of each of Nigeria's ethnicities has always remained controversial and disputed as members of different ethnic groups believe the census is rigged to give a particular group (usually believed to be northern groups) numerical superiority.There are small minorities of British, American, East Indian, Chinese (est.
50,000), white Zimbabwean, Japanese, Greek, Syrian and Lebanese immigrants in Nigeria.
Immigrants also include those from other West African or East African nations.
These minorities mostly reside in major cities such as Lagos and Abuja, or in the Niger Delta as employees for the major oil companies.
A number of Cubans settled in Nigeria as political refugees following the Cuban Revolution.In the middle of the 19th century, a number of ex-slaves of Afro-Cuban and Afro-Brazilian descent and emigrants from Sierra Leone established communities in Lagos and other regions of Nigeria.
Many ex-slaves came to Nigeria following the emancipation of slaves in the Americas.
Many of the immigrants, sometimes called Saros (immigrants from Sierra Leone) and Amaro (ex-slaves from Brazil) later became prominent merchants and missionaries in these cities.
What year was the National Autonomous University of Mexico established
The National Autonomous University of Mexico was officially established in 1910, and the university become one of the most important institutes of higher learning in Mexico.
UNAM provides world class education in science, medicine, and engineering.
Many scientific institutes and new institutes of higher learning, such as National Polytechnic Institute (founded in 1936), were established during the first half of the 20th century.
Most of the new research institutes were created within UNAM.
Twelve institutes were integrated into UNAM from 1929 to 1973.
In 1959, the Mexican Academy of Sciences was created to coordinate scientific efforts between academics.In 1995 the Mexican chemist Mario J. Molina shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Paul J. Crutzen and F. Sherwood Rowland for their work in atmospheric chemistry, particularly concerning the formation and decomposition of ozone.
Molina, an alumnus of UNAM, became the first Mexican citizen to win the Nobel Prize in science.In recent years, the largest scientific project being developed in Mexico was the construction of the Large Millimeter Telescope (Gran Telescopio Milimétrico, GMT), the world's largest and most sensitive single-aperture telescope in its frequency range.
It was designed to observe regions of space obscured by stellar dust.
How many South Vietnamese were executed in killings?
In the aftermath of the war, under Lê Duẩn's administration, the government embarked on a mass campaign of collectivization of farms and factories.
This caused economic chaos and resulted in triple-digit inflation, while national reconstruction efforts progressed slowly.
At least one million South Vietnamese were sent to reeducation camps, with an estimated 165,000 prisoners dying.
Between 100,000 and 200,000 South Vietnamese were executed in extrajudicial killings; another 50,000 died performing hard labor in "New Economic Zones".
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, millions of people fled the country in crudely built boats, creating an international humanitarian crisis; hundreds of thousands died at sea.In 1978, the Vietnamese military invaded Cambodia to remove from power the Khmer Rouge, who had been attacking Vietnamese border villages.
Vietnam was victorious, installing a government in Cambodia which ruled until 1989.
This action worsened relations with the Chinese, who launched a brief incursion into northern Vietnam in 1979.
This conflict caused Vietnam to rely even more heavily on Soviet economic and military aid.At the Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam in December 1986, reformist politicians replaced the "old guard" government with new leadership.
The reformers were led by 71-year-old Nguyen Van Linh, who became the party's new general secretary.
Linh and the reformers implemented a series of free-market reforms – known as "" ("Renovation") – which carefully managed the transition from a planned economy to a "socialist-oriented market economy".Though the authority of the state remained unchallenged under "Đổi Mới", the government encouraged private ownership of farms and factories, economic deregulation and foreign investment, while maintaining control over strategic industries.
The Vietnamese economy subsequently achieved strong growth in agricultural and industrial production, construction, exports and foreign investment.
However, these reforms have also caused a rise in income inequality and gender disparities.
What is a major component of Egypt's economy?
Egypt ( ""), is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia, via a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula.
Most of its territory of lies within the Nile Valley of North Africa and is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Gulf of Aqaba to the east, the Red Sea to the east and south, Sudan to the south and Libya to the west.With over 86 million inhabitants, Egypt is one of the most populous countries in Africa and the Middle East, and the 15th-most populated in the world.
The great majority of its people live near the banks of the Nile River, an area of about , where the only arable land is found.
The large regions of the Sahara Desert, which constitute most of Egypt's territory, are sparsely inhabited.
About half of Egypt's residents live in urban areas, with most spread across the densely populated centres of greater Cairo, Alexandria and other major cities in the Nile Delta.Egypt has one of the longest histories of any modern state, having been continuously inhabited since the 10th millennium BC.
Its monuments, such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx, were constructed by its ancient civilization, which was one of the most powerful of its time and one of the first six civilizations to arise independently in the world.
Its ancient ruins, such as those of Memphis, Thebes, Karnak, and the Valley of the Kings outside Luxor, are a significant focus of archaeological study and popular interest from around the world.
Egypt's rich cultural legacy, as well as the attraction of its Red Sea Riviera, have made tourism a vital part of the economy, employing about 12 percent of the country's workforce.The economy of Egypt is one of the most diversified in the Middle East, with sectors such as tourism, agriculture, industry and services at almost equal production levels.
Egypt is considered to be a regional and middle power, with significant cultural, political, and military influence in North Africa, the Middle East and the Muslim world.
The fault lines that led to the creation of the Black Sea contributed to the creation of what other geologic features of Turkey?
Turkey is a transcontinental Eurasian country.
Asian Turkey (made up largely of Anatolia), which includes 97% of the country, is separated from European Turkey by the Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles.
European Turkey comprises 3% of the country.The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
It lies between latitudes 35° and 43° N, and longitudes 25° and 45° E. Turkey's area, including lakes, occupies 783,562 square kilometres (300,948 sq mi), of which 755,688 square kilometres (291,773 sq mi) are in Southwest Asia and 23,764 square kilometres (9,174 sq mi) in Europe.
Turkey is the world's 37th-largest country in terms of area.
The country is encircled by seas on three sides: the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north and the Mediterranean to the south.
Turkey also contains the Sea of Marmara in the northwest.The European section of Turkey, East Thrace, forms the borders of Turkey with Greece and Bulgaria.
The Asian part of the country, Anatolia, consists of a high central plateau with narrow coastal plains, between the Köroğlu and Pontic mountain ranges to the north and the Taurus Mountains to the south.
Eastern Turkey has a more mountainous landscape and is home to the sources of rivers such as the Euphrates, Tigris and Aras, and contains Mount Ararat, Turkey's highest point at 5,137 metres (16,854 ft), and Lake Van, the largest lake in the country.Turkey is divided into seven census regions: Marmara, Aegean, Black Sea, Central Anatolia, Eastern Anatolia, Southeastern Anatolia and the Mediterranean.
The uneven north Anatolian terrain running along the Black Sea resembles a long, narrow belt.
This region comprises approximately one-sixth of Turkey's total land area.
As a general trend, the inland Anatolian plateau becomes increasingly rugged as it progresses eastward.Turkey's varied landscapes are the product of complex earth movements that have shaped the region over thousands of years and still manifest themselves in fairly frequent earthquakes and occasional volcanic eruptions.
The Bosphorus and the Dardanelles owe their existence to the fault lines running through Turkey that led to the creation of the Black Sea.
There is an earthquake fault line across the north of the country from west to east, along which a major earthquake occurred in 1999.
In 2005, how did Germany spend of its GDP on health care?
Germany has the world's oldest universal health care system, dating back to Bismarck's social legislation in 1883.
He stressed the importance of three key principles; solidarity, the government is responsible to ensure access by those who are in need, subsidiarity, policies are implemented with smallest no political and administrative influence, and corporatism, the government representative bodies in health care professions deems feasible procedures.
Since then there have been many reforms and provisions to ensure a balanced health care system.
Currently the population is covered by a fairly comprehensive health insurance plan provided by statute.
Certain groups of people (lifetime officials, self-employed persons, employees with high income) can opt out of the plan and switch to a private insurance contract.
Previously, these groups could also choose to do without insurance, but this option was dropped in 2009.
According to the World Health Organization, Germany's health care system was 77% government-funded and 23% privately funded .
In 2005, Germany spent 11% of its GDP on health care.
Germany ranked 20th in the world in life expectancy with 77 years for men and 82 years for women, and it had a very low infant mortality rate (4 per 1,000 live births)., the principal cause of death was cardiovascular disease, at 41%, followed by malignant tumours, at 26%., about 82,000 Germans had been infected with HIV/AIDS and 26,000 had died from the disease (cumulatively, since 1982).This article may incorporate text from this source, which is in the public domain.</ref>According to a 2005 survey, 27% of German adults are smokers.
What does Khana Ratsadon mean in English?
Prior to 1932, the Kingdom of Siam did not possess a legislature, as all legislative powers were vested within the person of the monarch.
This had been the case since the foundation of the Sukhothai Kingdom in the 12th century: as the king was seen as a "Dharmaraja" or "King who rules in accordance with Dharma" (the Buddhist law of righteousness).
However on 24 June 1932 a group of civilians and military officers, calling themselves the Khana Ratsadon (or People's Party) carried out a bloodless revolution, in which the 150 years of absolute rule of the House of Chakri was ended.
In its stead the group advocated a constitutional form of monarchy with an elected legislature.The "Draft Constitution" of 1932 signed by King Prajadhipok, created Thailand's first legislature, a People's Assembly with 70 appointed members.
The assembly met for the first time on 28 June 1932, in the Ananda Samakhom Throne Hall.
The Khana Ratsadon decided that the people were not yet ready for an elected assembly; however they later changed their minds.
By the time the "permanent" constitution came into force in December of that year, elections were scheduled for 15 November 1933.
The new constitution also changed the composition of the assembly to 78 directly elected and 78 appointed (by the Khana Ratsadon) together compromising 156 members.
What are some examples of fine works of Western architecture that can be found in Italy?
Italy has a very broad and diverse architectural style, which cannot be simply classified by period, but also by region, because of Italy's division into several regional states until 1861.
This has created a highly diverse and eclectic range in architectural designs.Italy is known for its considerable architectural achievements, such as the construction of arches, domes and similar structures during ancient Rome, the founding of the Renaissance architectural movement in the late-14th to 16th centuries, and being the homeland of Palladianism, a style of construction which inspired movements such as that of Neoclassical architecture, and influenced the designs which noblemen built their country houses all over the world, notably in the UK, Australia and the US during the late 17th to early 20th centuries.
Several of the finest works in Western architecture, such as the Colosseum, the Milan Cathedral and Florence cathedral, the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the building designs of Venice are found in Italy.Italian architecture has also widely influenced the architecture of the world.
British architect Inigo Jones, inspired by the designs of Italian buildings and cities, brought back the ideas of Italian Renaissance architecture to 17th-century England, being inspired by Andrea Palladio.
Additionally, Italianate architecture, popular abroad since the 19th century, was used to describe foreign architecture which was built in an Italian style, especially modelled on Renaissance architecture.
On what date did three British colonies joined to form the federal dominion of Canada?
Canada is a country in North America consisting of 10 provinces and 3 territories.
Located in the northern part of the continent, it extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean.
At 9.98 million square kilometres in total, Canada is the world's second-largest country by total area, and its common border with the United States is the world's longest land border shared by the same two countries.The land that is now Canada has been inhabited for millennia by various Aboriginal peoples.
Beginning in the late 15th century, British and French colonies were established on the region's Atlantic coast.
As a consequence of various conflicts, the United Kingdom gained and lost North American territories until left in the late 18th century with what mostly comprises Canada today.
On July 1, 1867, three British colonies joined to form the federal dominion of Canada.
Other colonies subsequently joined and the remainder of Britain's lands were transferred to Canada.Canada is a federal parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state.
Canada is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations.
The country is officially bilingual at the federal level.
It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries, with a population of approximately 35 million as of December 2012.
Its advanced economy is one of the largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed trade networks.
Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture.Canada is a developed country and one of the wealthiest in the world, with the eighth highest per capita income globally, and the eleventh highest ranking in the Human Development Index.
It ranks among the highest in international measurements of education, government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, and economic freedom.
Canada's participation in economic international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings includes the G8 (Group of Eight), the Group of Ten (economic), the Group of Twenty (G-20 major economies), the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
Canada's alliances include the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
How man professional orchestras does Spain have?
Spanish music is often considered abroad to be synonymous with flamenco, a West Andalusian musical genre, which, contrary to popular belief, is not widespread outside that region.
Various regional styles of folk music abound in Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, Castile, the Basque Country, Galicia and Asturias.
Pop, rock, hip hop and heavy metal are also popular.In the field of classical music, Spain has produced a number of noted composers such as Isaac Albéniz, Manuel de Falla and Enrique Granados and singers and performers such as Plácido Domingo, José Carreras, Montserrat Caballé, Alicia de Larrocha, Alfredo Kraus, Pablo Casals, Ricardo Viñes, José Iturbi, Pablo de Sarasate, Jordi Savall and Teresa Berganza.
In Spain there are over forty professional orchestras, including the Orquestra Simfònica de Barcelona, Orquesta Nacional de España and the Orquesta Sinfónica de Madrid.
Major opera houses include the Teatro Real,the Gran Teatre del Liceu, Teatro Arriaga and the El Palau de les Arts Reina Sofía.Thousands of music fans also travel to Spain each year for internationally recognised summer music festivals Sónar which often features the top up and coming pop and techno acts, and Benicàssim which tends to feature alternative rock and dance acts.
Both festivals mark Spain as an international music presence and reflect the tastes of young people in the country.The most popular traditional musical instrument, the guitar, originated in Spain.
Typical of the north are the traditional bag pipers or "gaiteros", mainly in Asturias and Galicia.
Why didn't Tolkien like the title "The Return of the King"
A dispute with his publisher, George Allen & Unwin, led to the book being offered to Collins in 1950.
Tolkien intended "The Silmarillion" (itself largely unrevised at this point) to be published along with "The Lord of the Rings," but A&U were unwilling to do this.
After Milton Waldman, his contact at Collins, expressed the belief that "The Lord of the Rings" itself "urgently wanted cutting", Tolkien eventually demanded that they publish the book in 1952.
Collins did not; and so Tolkien wrote to Allen and Unwin, saying, "I would gladly consider the publication of any part of the stuff.
"For publication, the book was divided into three volumes: "The Fellowship of the Ring" (Books I, "The Ring Sets Out", and II, "The Ring Goes South"), "The Two Towers" (Books III, "The Treason of Isengard", and IV, "The Ring Goes East"), and "The Return of the King" (Books V, "The War of the Ring", and VI, "The End of the Third Age", plus six appendices).
This was due largely to post-war paper shortages, as well as being a way to keep down the price of the book.
Delays in producing appendices, maps and especially indices led to the volumes being published later than originally hoped — on 21 July 1954, on 11 November 1954 and on 20 October 1955 respectively in the United Kingdom, and slightly later in the United States.
"The Return of the King" was especially delayed.
Tolkien, moreover, did not especially like the title "The Return of the King", believing it gave away too much of the storyline.
He had originally suggested "The War of the Ring", which was dismissed by his publishers.The books were published under a profit-sharing arrangement, whereby Tolkien would not receive an advance or royalties until the books had broken even, after which he would take a large share of the profits.
It has ultimately become the second best-selling novel ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.
Only "A Tale of Two Cities" by Charles Dickens has sold more copies worldwide (over 200 million) while the fourth best-selling novel is Tolkien's "The Hobbit".
What did Orion pictures fear about 'The Terminator?'
Orion Pictures did not have faith in "The Terminator" performing well at the box office and feared a negative critical reception.
At an early screening of the film, the actors' agents insisted to the producers that the film should be screened for critics.
Orion only held one press screening for the film.
The film was premiered on October 26, 1984.
On its opening week, "The Terminator" played at 1,005 theaters and grossed $4,020,663 making it number one in the box office.
The film remained at number one in its second week.
It lost its number one spot in the third week to "Oh, God!
You Devil".
Cameron noted that "The Terminator" was a hit "relative to its market, which is between the summer and the Christmas blockbusters.
But it's better to be a big fish in a small pond than the other way around.
"Writer Harlan Ellison stated that he "loved the movie, was just blown away by it", but believed that the screenplay was based on an episode of "The Outer Limits" he had written, titled "Soldier".
Orion gave Ellison an undisclosed amount of money and an acknowledgment credit in later prints of the film.
Some accounts of the settlement state that "Demon with a Glass Hand", another "Outer Limits" episode written by Ellison, was also claimed to have been plagiarized by the film, but Ellison has explicitly stated that "The Terminator" "was a ripoff" of "Soldier" rather than "Demon with a Glass Hand".Cameron was against Orion's decision and was told that if he did not agree with the settlement, they would have Cameron pay for any damages if Orion lost Ellison's suit.
Cameron replied that he "had no choice but to agree with the settlement.
Of course there was a gag order as well, so I couldn't tell this story, but now I frankly don't care.
It's the truth.
Harlan Ellison is a parasite who can kiss my ass."
What year was Terminator Salvation released?
The film was released in North America on May 21, 2009 with Warner Bros. setting the American premiere on May 14, 2009 at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood.
Elsewhere, Sony Pictures Entertainment released the film in most overseas territories on different dates in June.
One exception was Mexico, however, because of the swine flu outbreak in the country, which forced Sony to push the release date to July 31, 2009.It is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for "intense sequences of sci-fi violence, action, and language," unlike the previous R-rated films.
The decision to release the film with a PG-13 rating has met with much criticism from fans, as well as the media.
The rating decision was made after McG cut out a shot of Marcus stabbing a thug with a screwdriver, as the director felt disallowing the young audience due to that one shot was unfair.
He also deleted a topless scene for Moon Bloodgood because, "It was a soft moment between a man and a woman that was designed to echo the Kelly McGillis/Harrison Ford moment in "Witness" in the end, it felt more like a gratuitous moment of a girl taking her top off in an action picture, and I didn't want that to convolute the story or the characters."
The producers had expected the rating because of the modern leniency towards violence in PG-13 films, such as the 2007 action film, "Live Free or Die Hard".
What film noticeably influenced the current generation of mainstream animated films?
Previous films and TV shows, such as "Fractured Fairy Tales" and "The Princess Bride", have parodied the traditional fairy tale.
However, "Shrek" itself has noticeably influenced the current generation of mainstream animated films.
Particularly after "Shrek 2", animated films began to incorporate more pop culture references and end-film musical numbers.
Such elements can be seen in films like "Robots", and "Chicken Little".
It also inspired a number of computer animated films which also spoofed fairy tales, or other related story genres, often including adult-oriented humor, most of which were not nearly as successful as "Shrek", such as "Happily N'Ever After", "Igor", and "Hoodwinked!
".

Who composed the score of The Shawshank Redemption?
The score was composed by Thomas Newman and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score in 1994, which was his first Oscar nomination.
The majority of the score consists of dark piano music, which plays along the main character's role at Shawshank.
The main theme ("End Titles" on the soundtrack album) is perhaps best known to modern audiences as the inspirational sounding music from many movie trailers dealing with inspirational, dramatic, or romantic films in much the same way that James Horner's driving music from the end of "Aliens" is used in many movie trailers for action films.
A central scene in the film features the "Letter Duet" ("Canzonetta sull'aria") from Mozart's "The Marriage of Figaro."

Why did Fincher protest the placement of "Fight Club" ads during World Wrestling Federation broadcasts?
Release.Marketing.Filming concluded in December 1998, and David Fincher edited the footage in early 1999 to prepare "Fight Club" for a screening with senior executives.
They did not receive the film positively and were concerned that there would not be an audience for the film.
Executive producer Art Linson, who supported the film, recalled the response: "So many incidences of "Fight Club" were alarming, no group of executives could narrow them down."
Nevertheless, "Fight Club" was originally slated to be released in July 1999 but was later changed to August 6, 1999.
The studio further delayed the film's release, this time to autumn, citing a crowded summer schedule and a hurried post-production process.
Outsiders attributed the delays to the Columbine High School massacre earlier in the year.Marketing executives at 20th Century Fox faced difficulties in marketing "Fight Club" and at one point considered marketing it as an art film.
They considered that the film was primarily geared toward male audiences because of its violence and believed that not even Brad Pitt would attract female filmgoers.
Research testing showed that the film appealed to teenagers.
Fincher refused to let the posters and trailers focus on Pitt and encouraged the studio to hire the advertising firm Wieden+Kennedy to devise a marketing plan.
The firm proposed a bar of pink soap with the title "Fight Club" embossed on it as the film's main marketing image; the proposal was considered "a bad joke" by Fox executives.
Fincher also released two early trailers in the form of fake public service announcements presented by Pitt and Norton; the studio did not think the trailers marketed the film appropriately.
Instead, the studio financed a $20 million large-scale campaign to provide a press junket, posters, billboards, and trailers for TV that highlighted the film's fight scenes.
The studio advertised "Fight Club" on cable during World Wrestling Federation broadcasts, which Fincher protested, believing that the placement created the wrong context for the film.
Linson believed that the "ill-conceived one-dimensional" marketing by marketing executive Robert Harper largely contributed to "Fight Club"s lukewarm box office performance in the United States.
What year was the score for the film released?
The 32-song soundtrack from the film was released on July 6, 1994.
With the exception of a lengthy suite from Alan Silvestri's score, all the songs are previously released; the soundtrack includes songs from Elvis Presley, Fleetwood Mac, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Aretha Franklin, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Three Dog Night, The Byrds, The Doors, Jimi Hendrix, The Mamas & the Papas, Aileen Quinn, The Doobie Brothers, Simon & Garfunkel, Bob Seger, Buffalo Springfield, and Michael McDonald among others.
Music producer Joel Sill reflected on compiling the soundtrack: "We wanted to have very recognizable material that would pinpoint time periods, yet we didn't want to interfere with what was happening cinematically."
The two-disc album has a variety of music from the 1950s–1980s performed by American artists.
According to Sills, this was due to Zemeckis' request, "All the material in there is American.
Bob (Zemeckis) felt strongly about it.
He felt that Forrest wouldn't buy anything but American.
"The soundtrack reached a peak of number 2 on the "Billboard" album chart.
The soundtrack went on to sell twelve million copies, and is one of the top selling albums in the United States.
The score for the film was composed and conducted by Alan Silvestri and released on August 2, 1994.
What 1995 Japanese cyberpunk film had a strong influence on The Matrix?
In the film, the code that comprises the Matrix itself is frequently represented as downward-flowing green characters.
This code utilizes a custom typeface designed by Simon Whiteley, which includes mirror images of half-width kana characters and Western Latin letters and numerals.
The color green reflects the green tint commonly used on early monochrome computer monitors.
Lynne Cartwright, the Visual Effects Supervisor at Animal Logic, supervised the creation of the film's opening title sequence, as well as the general look of the Matrix code throughout the film, in collaboration with Lindsey Fleay and Justen Marshall.
The portrayal resembles the opening credits of the 1995 Japanese cyberpunk film, "Ghost in the Shell", which had a strong influence on the "Matrix" series (see below).
It was also used in the subsequent films, on the related website, and in the game "", and its drop-down effect is reflected in the design of some posters for the "Matrix" series.
The code received the Runner-up Award in the 1999 Jesse Garson Award for In-film typography or opening credit sequence.
"The Matrix"s production designer, Owen Paterson, used methods to distinguish the "real world" and the Matrix in a pervasive way.
The production design team generally placed a bias towards the Matrix code's distinctive green color in scenes set within the simulation, whereas there is an emphasis on the color blue during scenes set in the "real world".
In addition, the Matrix scenes' sets were slightly more decayed, monolithic, and grid-like, to convey the cold, logical and artificial nature of that environment.
For the "real world", the actors' hair was less styled, their clothing had more textile content, and the cinematographers used longer lenses to soften the backgrounds and emphasize the actors.The "Nebuchadnezzar" was designed to have a patched-up look, instead of clean, cold and sterile space ship interior sets as used on films like "Star Trek".
The wires were made visible to show the ship's working internals, and each composition was carefully designed to convey the ship as "a marriage between Man and Machine".
For the scene when Neo wakes up in the pod connected to the Matrix, the pod was constructed to look dirty, used, and sinister.
During the testing of a breathing mechanism in the pod, the tester went into hypothermia in under eight minutes, so the pod had to be heated.Kym Barrett, costume designer, said that she defined the characters and their environment by their costume.
For example, Reeves' office costume was designed for Thomas Anderson to look uncomfortable, disheveled, and out of place.
Barrett sometimes used three types of fabric for each costume, and also had to consider acting practicality.
The actors needed to perform martial art actions in their costume, hang upside-down without people seeing up their dress, or work the wires when strapped to the harnesses.
For Trinity, Barrett experimented with how each fabric absorbs and reflects different types of light, and was eventually able to make Trinity's costume mercury-like and oil-slick to suit the character.
For the Agents, their costume was designed to create a secret service, undercover look, resembling the film "JFK".The sunglasses, a staple to the film's aesthetics, were commissioned for the film to designer Richard Walker from sunglass maker Blinde Design.

What is the highest-grossing motion picture worldwide of 1994?
Reception.Box office.
"The Lion King" earned $422,783,777 in North America and an $564,700,000 in other territories for a worldwide total of $987,483,777.
It is the ninteenth highest-grossing film, the third-highest-grossing animated film of all time worldwide and the second highest-grossing film of Walt Disney Animation Studios (behind "Frozen)".
It is also the highest-grossing motion picture of 1994 worldwide.
After its initial run, having earned $768.6 million, it ranked as the second-highest grossing film of all time worldwide, behind "Jurassic Park" .
It held the record for the highest-grossing animated feature film (in North America, outside North America, and worldwide) until it was surpassed by the computer animated "Finding Nemo" (2003), "Shrek 2" (2004), "" (2009), "Toy Story 3" (2010), and "Frozen" (2013).
During its 3D re-release, "The Lion King" surpassed all the afomentioned films but "Toy Story 3" to rank as the second-highest-grossing animated film worldwide, and the highest-grossing hand-drawn animation.

Where were the exteriors above the prison filmed?
Concept artist Tully Summers commented on Nolan's style of cinematography when asked about the difference between his designs for this film and fantasy-based designs for "Men in Black 3": "The difference for me was Christopher Nolan's visual style.
One of the things that makes his Batman movies so compelling is their tone of plausibility.
He will often prefer a raw, grittier design over one that is very sleek and product design pretty.
It's sort of a practical military aesthetic.
This stuff is made to work, not impress shoppers.
"The Dark Knight Rises" is a war film."
Producer Emma Thomas stated this Batman film has a different visual aesthetic from the first two Nolan-directed features, explaining that "it's meant to be winter in Gotham, so that right there is going to lend a whole different look to the film.
"The film introduces a vehicle that has been compared with the Batplane, dubbed "the Bat".
In designing the Bat, Nathan Crowley approached it as if it were an actual military project, emphasising the need for it to "fit into the same family" as the Tumbler and the Batpod.
The final version of the Bat takes its design cues from the Harrier Jump Jet, Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey and the Boeing AH-64 Apache.
Chris Corbould described the Bat's size and shape as presenting a major challenge for filming given Christopher Nolan's emphasis on practical effects over computer-generated imagery.
In order to make the Bat "fly", it was variously supported by wires, suspended from cranes and helicopters, and mounted on a purpose-built vehicle with hydraulic controls to simulate movement.When designing the Batcave set, Crowley and fellow production designer Kevin Kavanaugh hit upon the idea of flooding the Batcave and having Batman's equipment, the Batsuit and a supercomputer rise from the water.
Another set was designed at Cardington as an "underground prison", a rough-hewn labyrinth of stone cells in a vast abyss with a vertical shaft leading to the surface.
Exteriors above the prison were filmed in Jodhpur, India, chosen because the "forbidding landscape added to the desolation".
Which song on the official soundtrack for Das Boot was not composed by Doldinger?
The characteristic lead melody of the soundtrack, composed and produced by Klaus Doldinger, took on a life of its own after German rave group U96 created a remixed "techno version" in 1991.
The title theme "Das Boot" later became an international hit.The official soundtrack features only compositions by Doldinger, except for "J'attendrai" sung by Rina Ketty.
The soundtrack ("Filmmusik") released following the release of "The Director's Cut" version omits "J'attendrai".Songs heard in the film, but not included on the album are "La Paloma" sung by Rosita Serrano, the "Erzherzog-Albrecht-Marsch" (a popular military march), "It's a Long Way to Tipperary" performed by the Red Army Chorus, Heimat, Deine Sterne and the Westerwald-Marsch.

Who composed and conducted the film score for "Toy Story 3?"
The film score for "Toy Story 3" was composed and conducted by Randy Newman, his sixth for Pixar after "Toy Story", "A Bug's Life", "Toy Story 2", "Monsters, Inc.", and "Cars".
Initially, Disney released the soundtrack only as digital download.
This was the second instance where Disney did not release the award-winning soundtrack of a Pixar film on CD, the first being "Up".
In January 2012, Intrada released the "Toy Story 3" soundtrack on Compact Disc.In addition to the tracks included in the soundtrack album, the film also uses several other tracks such as "Dream Weaver" by Gary Wright, "Le Freak" by Chic, and Randy Newman's original version of "You've Got a Friend in Me."
Furthermore, tracks "Cowboy!"
and "Come to Papa" included material from Newman's rejected score to "Air Force One".
The song "Losing You" from Newman's own album "Harps and Angels" was also used in the first trailer for the film.
The Judas Priest song "Electric Eye" was also used in the film in the temp score for the opening scene of "Toy Story 3".
The aliens are playing the tune in their sports car.
The song was ultimately replaced by another piece of music.

How much money did Batman Begins amount on it's opening weekend?
Batman Begins is a 2005 British-American superhero film based on the fictional DC Comics character Batman, co-written and directed by Christopher Nolan.
It stars Christian Bale as Batman along with Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman.
The film reboots the "Batman" film series, telling the origin story of the character from Bruce Wayne's initial fear of bats, the death of his parents, his journey to become Batman, and his fight against Ra's al Ghul's plot to destroy Gotham City.
It draws inspiration from classic comic book storylines such as "The Man Who Falls", ', and '.After a series of unsuccessful projects to resurrect Batman on screen following the 1997 critical failure of "Batman & Robin", Nolan and David S. Goyer began to work on the film in early 2003 and aimed for a darker and more realistic tone, with humanity and realism being the basis of the film.
The goal was to get the audience to care for both Batman and Bruce Wayne.
The film, which was primarily shot in Iceland and Chicago, relied on traditional stunts and miniatures – computer-generated imagery was used minimally.
"Batman Begins" was both critically and commercially successful.
The film opened on June 17, 2005, in the United States and Canada in 3,858 theaters.
It grossed $48 million in its opening weekend in North America, eventually grossing over $372 million worldwide.
The film received critical acclaim and has been considered by many as one of the best superhero films ever made.
Critics noted that fear was a common motif throughout the film, and remarked that it had a darker tone compared with previous "Batman" films.
The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Cinematography and three BAFTA awards.The film is followed by "The Dark Knight" (2008) and "The Dark Knight Rises" (2012) in a continual story-arc, which has later been referred to as "The Dark Knight" trilogy.
When was the Brusilov Offensive in eastern Galicia?
Despite the success of the June 1916 Brusilov Offensive in eastern Galicia, dissatisfaction with the Russian government's conduct of the war grew.
The offensive's success was undermined by the reluctance of other generals to commit their forces to support the victory.
Allied and Russian forces were revived only temporarily by Romania's entry into the war on 27 August.
German forces came to the aid of embattled Austro-Hungarian units in Transylvania while a German-Bulgarian force attacked from the south, and Bucharest fell to the Central Powers on 6 December.
Meanwhile, unrest grew in Russia, as the Tsar remained at the front.
Empress Alexandra's increasingly incompetent rule drew protests and resulted in the murder of her favourite, Rasputin, at the end of 1916.In March 1917, demonstrations in Petrograd culminated in the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II and the appointment of a weak Provisional Government, which shared power with the Petrograd Soviet socialists.
This arrangement led to confusion and chaos both at the front and at home.
The army became increasingly ineffective.Discontent and the weaknesses of the Provisional Government led to a rise in the popularity of the Bolshevik Party, led by Vladimir Lenin, which demanded an immediate end to the war.
The successful armed uprising by the Bolsheviks of November was followed in December by an armistice and negotiations with Germany.
At first, the Bolsheviks refused the German terms, but when German troops began marching across the Ukraine unopposed, the new government acceded to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on 3 March 1918.
The treaty ceded vast territories, including Finland, the Baltic provinces, parts of Poland and Ukraine to the Central Powers.
Despite this enormous apparent German success, the manpower required for German occupation of former Russian territory may have contributed to the failure of the Spring Offensive and secured relatively little food or other materiel.With the adoption of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Entente no longer existed.
The Allied powers led a small-scale invasion of Russia, partly to stop Germany from exploiting Russian resources and, to a lesser extent, to support the "Whites" (as opposed to the "Reds") in the Russian Civil War.
Allied troops landed in Arkhangelsk and in Vladivostok as part of the North Russia Intervention.
In 1938, at the outbreak of World War II, which had a larger population, the Western Allies (United Kingdom, France, Poland and British Dominions) or the European Axis (Germany and Italy)
In Europe, before the outbreak of the war, the Allies had significant advantages in both population and economics.
In 1938, the Western Allies (United Kingdom, France, Poland and British Dominions) had a 30 percent larger population and a 30 percent higher gross domestic product than the European Axis (Germany and Italy); if colonies are included, it then gives the Allies more than a 5:1 advantage in population and nearly 2:1 advantage in GDP.
In Asia at the same time, China had roughly six times the population of Japan, but only an 89 percent higher GDP; this is reduced to three times the population and only a 38 percent higher GDP if Japanese colonies are included.Though the Allies' economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of Germany and Japan, they became the decisive factor by 1942, after the United States and Soviet Union joined the Allies, as the war largely settled into one of attrition.
While the Allies' ability to out-produce the Axis is often attributed to the Allies having more access to natural resources, other factors, such as Germany and Japan's reluctance to employ women in the labour force, Allied strategic bombing, and Germany's late shift to a war economy contributed significantly.
Additionally, neither Germany nor Japan planned to fight a protracted war, and were not equipped to do so.
To improve their production, Germany and Japan used millions of slave labourers; Germany used about 12 million people, mostly from Eastern Europe, while Japan pressed more than 18 million people in Far East Asia.
Who testified that Booth sent supplies to Mudd's house?
The degree of Mudd's culpability has remained a controversy ever since.
Some, including Mudd's grandson Richard Mudd, claimed that Mudd was innocent of any wrongdoing and that he had been imprisoned merely for treating a man who came to his house late at night with a fractured leg.
Over a century after the assassination, Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan both wrote letters to Richard Mudd agreeing that his grandfather committed no crime.
However, others, including authors Edward Steers, Jr. and James Swanson, assert that Samuel Mudd visited Booth three times in the months before the failed kidnapping attempt.
The first time was November 1864 when Booth, looking for help in his kidnapping plot, was directed to Mudd by agents of the Confederate Secret Service.
In December, Booth met with Mudd again and stayed the night at his farm.
Later that December, Mudd went to Washington and introduced Booth to a Confederate agent he knew — John Surratt.
Additionally, George Atzerodt testified that Booth sent supplies to Mudd's house in preparation for the kidnap plan.
Mudd lied to the authorities who came to his house after the assassination, claiming that he did not recognize the man who showed up on his doorstep in need of treatment and giving false information about where Booth and Herold went.
He also hid the monogrammed boot that he had cut off Booth's injured leg behind a panel in his attic, but the thorough search of Mudd's house soon revealed this further evidence against him.
One hypothesis is that Dr. Mudd was active in the kidnapping plot, likely as the person the conspirators would turn to for medical treatment in case Lincoln were injured, and that Booth thus remembered the doctor and went to his house to get help in the early hours of April 15.
When did Congress pass the Mobile Act which recognized West Florida as being part of the United States?
A dispute immediately arose between Spain and the United States regarding the extent of Louisiana.
The territory's boundaries had not been defined in the 1762 Treaty of Fontainebleau that ceded it from France to Spain, nor the 1800 Third Treaty of San Ildefonso ceding it back to France, nor the 1803 Louisiana Purchase agreement ceding it to the United States.The United States claimed Louisiana included the entire western portion of the Mississippi River drainage basin to the crest of the Rocky Mountains and land extending southeast to the Rio Grande and West Florida.
Spain insisted that Louisiana comprised no more than the western bank of the Mississippi River and the cities of New Orleans and St. Louis.
The dispute was ultimately resolved by the Adams-Onis Treaty of 1819, with the United States gaining most of what it had claimed in the west.The relatively narrow Louisiana of New Spain had been a special province under the jurisdiction of the Captaincy General of Cuba while the vast region to the west was in 1803 still considered part of the Commandancy General of the Provincias Internas.
Louisiana had never been considered to be one of New Spain's internal provinces.If the territory included all the tributaries of the Mississippi on its western bank, the northern reaches of the Purchase extended into the equally ill-defined British possession—Rupert's Land of British North America, now part of Canada.
The Purchase originally extended just beyond the 50th parallel.
However, the territory north of the 49th parallel (including the Milk River and Poplar River watersheds) was ceded to the UK in exchange for parts of the Red River Basin south of 49th parallel in the Anglo-American Convention of 1818.The eastern boundary of the Louisiana purchase was the Mississippi River, from its source to the 31st parallel, although the source of the Mississippi was, at the time, unknown.
The eastern boundary below the 31st parallel was unclear; the U.S. claimed the land as far as the Perdido River, and Spain claimed the border of its Florida Colony remained the Mississippi river.
In early 1804, Congress passed the Mobile Act which recognized West Florida as being part of the United States.
The Adams–Onís Treaty with Spain (1819) resolved the issue upon ratification in 1821.
Today, the 31st parallel is the northern boundary of the western half of the Florida Panhandle, and the Perdido is the western boundary of Florida.Because the western boundary was contested at the time of the Purchase, President Jefferson immediately began to organize three missions to explore and map the new territory.
All three started from the Mississippi River.
The Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804) traveled up the Missouri River; the Red River Expedition (1806) explored the Red River basin; the Pike Expedition (1806) also started up the Missouri, but turned south to explore the Arkansas River watershed.
The maps and journals of the explorers helped to define the boundaries during the negotiations leading to the Adams–Onís Treaty, which set the western boundary as follows: north up the Sabine River from the Gulf of Mexico to its intersection with the 32nd parallel, due north to the Red River, up the Red River to the 100th meridian, north to the Arkansas River, up the Arkansas River to its headwaters, due north to the 42nd parallel and due west to its previous boundary.
Who was the head of the Counter Intelligence Branch of the Western Defense Command?
The prospect of sabotage was always present, and sometimes suspected when there were equipment failures.
While there were some problems believed to be the result of careless or disgruntled employees, there were no confirmed instances of Axis-instigated sabotage.
However, on 10 March 1945, a Japanese fire balloon struck a power line, and the resulting power surge caused the three reactors at Hanford to be temporarily shut down.
With so many people involved, security was a difficult task.
A special Counter Intelligence Corps detachment was formed to handle the project's security issues.
By 1943, it was clear that the Soviet Union was attempting to penetrate the project.
Lieutenant Colonel Boris T. Pash, the head of the Counter Intelligence Branch of the Western Defense Command, investigated suspected Soviet espionage at the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley.
Oppenheimer informed Pash that he had been approached by a fellow professor at Berkeley, Haakon Chevalier, about passing information to the Soviet Union.The most successful Soviet spy was Klaus Fuchs, a member of the British Mission who played an important part at Los Alamos.
The 1950 revelation of Fuchs' espionage activities damaged the United States' nuclear cooperation with Britain and Canada.
Subsequently, other instances of espionage were uncovered, leading to the arrest of Harry Gold, David Greenglass and Ethel and Julius Rosenberg.
Other spies like George Koval and Theodore Hall remained unknown for decades.
The value of the espionage is difficult to quantify, as the principal constraint on the Soviet atomic bomb project was a shortage of uranium ore.
The consensus is that espionage saved the Soviets one or two years of effort.
How many Vietnamese civilians died in the Vietnam War?
Estimates of the number of casualties vary, with one source suggesting up to 3.8 million violent war deaths.195,000–430,000 South Vietnamese civilians died in the war.
50,000–65,000 North Vietnamese civilians died in the war.
The Army of the Republic of Vietnam lost between 171,331 and 220,357 men during the war.
The official US Department of Defense figure was 950,765 communist forces killed in Vietnam from 1965 to 1974.
Defense Department officials believed that these body count figures need to be deflated by 30 percent.
In addition, Guenter Lewy assumes that one-third of the reported "enemy" killed may have been civilians, concluding that the actual number of deaths of communist military forces was probably closer to 444,000.
A detailed demographic study calculated 791,000–1,141,000 war-related deaths for all of Vietnam.
Between 200,000 and 300,000 Cambodians died during the war.
About 60,000 Laotians also died, and 58,220 U.S. service members were killed.

What year did  the women of Boston produce 40,000 skeins of yarn, and 180 women in Middletown, Massachusetts wove of cloth?
Women contributed to the American Revolution in many ways, and were involved on both sides.
While formal Revolutionary politics did not include women, ordinary domestic behaviors became charged with political significance as Patriot women confronted a war that permeated all aspects of political, civil, and domestic life.
They participated by boycotting British goods, spying on the British, following armies as they marched, washing, cooking, and tending for soldiers, delivering secret messages, and in a few cases like Deborah Samson, fighting disguised as men.
Also, Mercy Otis Warren held meetings in her house and cleverly attacked Loyalists with her creative plays and histories.
Above all, they continued the agricultural work at home to feed their families and the armies.
They maintained their families during their husbands' absences and sometimes after their deaths.American women were integral to the success of the boycott of British goods, as the boycotted items were largely household items such as tea and cloth.
Women had to return to knitting goods, and to spinning and weaving their own cloth — skills that had fallen into disuse.
In 1769, the women of Boston produced 40,000 skeins of yarn, and 180 women in Middletown, Massachusetts wove of cloth.A crisis of political loyalties could disrupt the fabric of colonial America women's social worlds: whether a man did or did not renounce his allegiance to the King could dissolve ties of class, family, and friendship, isolating women from former connections.
A woman's loyalty to her husband, once a private commitment, could become a political act, especially for women in America committed to men who remained loyal to the King.
Legal divorce, usually rare, was granted to Patriot women whose husbands supported the King.
When was the Peace of Augsburg recognized?
The Reformation led to a series of religious wars that culminated in the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648), which devastated much of Germany, killing between 25 and 40% of its population.
From 1618 to 1648 the Roman Catholic House of Habsburg and its allies fought against the Protestant princes of Germany, supported at various times by Denmark, Sweden and France.
The Habsburgs, who ruled Spain, Austria, Slovene Lands, the Spanish Netherlands and much of Germany and Italy, were staunch defenders of the Roman Catholic Church.
Some historians believe that the era of the Reformation came to a close when Roman Catholic France allied itself, first in secret and later on the battlefields, with Protestant states against the Habsburg dynasty.
For the first time since the days of Luther, political and national convictions again outweighed religious convictions in Europe.The main tenets of the Peace of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years' War, were:
 All parties would now recognise the Peace of Augsburg of 1555, by which each prince would have the right to determine the religion of his own state, the options being Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism, and now Calvinism (the principle of "cuius regio, eius religio")
 Christians living in principalities where their denomination was "not" the established church were guaranteed the right to practice their faith in public during allotted hours and in private at their will.
The treaty also effectively ended the papacy's pan-European political power.
Fully aware of the loss, Pope Innocent X declared the treaty "null, void, invalid, iniquitous, unjust, damnable, reprobate, inane, empty of meaning and effect for all times."
European sovereigns, Roman Catholic and Protestant alike, ignored his verdict.However, this treaty did not mean that the Reformation concluded.
It would be about another century (ca.
1750) before the Reformation could truly be considered to have ended.
Meanwhile, other reform movements continued to spring up, even within the Reformation churches.
One such movement was Pietism, which impacted the Low Countries (hence the Reformed churches), Germany (hence also Lutheranism), and Great Britain, which led to a split in Lutheranism and which brought about the creation of some new churches (most notably the Moravian Church and Methodism).
In turn, Pietism would branch out into a "normative" form and Radical Pietism.The Reformation had a wide-ranging influence on personal life.
In fashion, for instance, it led to a more sober and dignified, less wasteful esthetics.Further impact on the Reformation came from the Age of Enlightenment, and its preponderance of Rationalism.
This would lead to redefined roles for religion, eventually relegating it to second-class status.In "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism", Max Weber first suggested that cultural values could affect economic success, arguing that the Protestant Reformation led to values that drove people toward worldly achievements, a hard work ethic, and saving to accumulate wealth for investment.
The new religions (in particular, Calvinism and other more austere Protestant groups) effectively forbade wastefully using hard earned money and identified the purchase of luxuries a sin.
Where was the biggest market for illicit tea?
As Europeans developed a taste for tea in the 17th century, rival companies were formed to import the product from China.
In England, Parliament gave the East India Company a monopoly on the importation of tea in 1698.
When tea became popular in the British colonies, Parliament sought to eliminate foreign competition by passing an act in 1721 that required colonists to import their tea only from Great Britain.
The East India Company did not export tea to the colonies; by law, the company was required to sell its tea wholesale at auctions in England.
British firms bought this tea and exported it to the colonies, where they resold it to merchants in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston.Until 1767, the East India Company paid an "ad valorem" tax of about 25% on tea that it imported into Great Britain.
Parliament laid additional taxes on tea sold for consumption in Britain.
These high taxes, combined with the fact that tea imported into Holland was not taxed by the Dutch government, meant that Britons and British Americans could buy smuggled Dutch tea at much cheaper prices.
The biggest market for illicit tea was England—by the 1760s the East India Company was losing £400,000 per year to smugglers in Great Britain—but Dutch tea was also smuggled into British America in significant quantities.In 1767, to help the East India Company compete with smuggled Dutch tea, Parliament passed the Indemnity Act, which lowered the tax on tea consumed in Great Britain, and gave the East India Company a refund of the 25% duty on tea that was re-exported to the colonies.
To help offset this loss of government revenue, Parliament also passed the Townshend Revenue Act of 1767, which levied new taxes, including one on tea, in the colonies.
Instead of solving the smuggling problem, however, the Townshend duties renewed a controversy about Parliament's right to tax the colonies.
What were the causes of Brtain's population doubling every 50 years?
According to Robert Hughes in "The Fatal Shore", the population of England and Wales, which had remained steady at 6 million from 1700 to 1740, rose dramatically after 1740.
The population of England had more than doubled from 8.3 million in 1801 to 16.8 million in 1850 and, by 1901, had nearly doubled again to 30.5 million.
As living conditions and health care improved during the 19th century, Britain's population doubled every 50 years.
Europe's population increased from about 100 million in 1700 to 400 million by 1900.The Industrial Revolution was the first period in history during which there was a simultaneous increase in population and in per capita income.
What, according to the economists, caused the Great Depression?
Two economists of the 1920s, Waddill Catchings and William Trufant Foster, popularized a theory that influenced many policy makers, including Herbert Hoover, Henry A. Wallace, Paul Douglas, and Marriner Eccles.
It held the economy produced more than it consumed, because the consumers did not have enough income.
Thus the unequal distribution of wealth throughout the 1920s caused the Great Depression.According to this view, the root cause of the Great Depression was a global over-investment in heavy industry capacity compared to wages and earnings from independent businesses, such as farms.
The solution was the government must pump money into consumers' pockets.
That is, it must redistribute purchasing power, maintain the industrial base, but re-inflate prices and wages to force as much of the inflationary increase in purchasing power into consumer spending.
The economy was overbuilt, and new factories were not needed.
Foster and Catchings recommended federal and state governments start large construction projects, a program followed by Hoover and Roosevelt.

Were Germany, Austra, and Hungary included in the negotiations?
Negotiations between the Allied powers started on 18 January in the "Salle de l'Horloge" at the French Foreign Ministry, on the Quai d'Orsay in Paris.
Initially, 70 delegates of 27 nations participated in the negotiations.
Having been defeated, Germany, Austria, and Hungary were excluded from the negotiations.
Russia was also excluded because it had negotiated a separate peace with Germany in 1918, in which Germany gained a large fraction of Russia's land and resources.
The treaty's terms were extremely harsh, as the negotiators at Versailles later pointed out.At first a "Council of Ten" comprising two delegates each from Britain, France, the United States, Italy and Japan), met officially to decide the peace terms.
It became the "Big Four" when Japan dropped out and the top person from each of the other four met in 145 closed sessions to make all the major decisions, which were later ratified by the entire assembly.
Apart from Italian issues, the main conditions were determined at personal meetings among the by the leaders of the "Big Three" nations: British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, and American President Woodrow Wilson.The minor nations attended a weekly "Plenary Conference" that discussed issues in a general forum but made no decisions.
These members formed over 50 commissions that made various recommendations, many of which were incorporated into the final Treaty.
When was the Chernobyl Recovery and Development Programme launched?
The United Nations Development Programme has launched in 2003 a specific project called the Chernobyl Recovery and Development Programme (CRDP) for the recovery of the affected areas.
The programme was initiated in February 2002 based on the recommendations in the report on Human Consequences of the Chernobyl Nuclear Accident.
The main goal of the CRDP's activities is supporting the Government of Ukraine in mitigating long-term social, economic, and ecological consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe.
CRDP works in the four most Chernobyl-affected areas in Ukraine: Kyivska, Zhytomyrska, Chernihivska and Rivnenska.
When did North Korea declare it 'is not restrained by the North-South declaration on non-aggression.'?
Division of Korea (1954–present).The Korean Armistice Agreement provided for monitoring by an international commission.
Since 1953, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC), composed of members from the Swiss and Swedish Armed Forces, has been stationed near the DMZ.In April 1975, South Vietnam's capital was captured by the North Vietnamese army.
Encouraged by the success of Communist revolution in Indochina, Kim Il-sung saw it as an opportunity to invade the South.
Kim visited China in April of that year, and met with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai to ask for military aid.
Despite Pyongyang's expectations, however, Beijing refused to help North Korea for another war in Korea.Since the armistice, there have been numerous incursions and acts of aggression by North Korea.
In 1976, the axe murder incident was widely publicized.
Since 1974, four incursion tunnels leading to Seoul have been uncovered.
In 2010, a North Korean submarine torpedoed and sank the South Korean corvette ROKS "Cheonan", resulting in the deaths of 46 sailors.
Again in 2010, North Korea fired artillery shells on Yeonpyeong island, killing two military personnel and two civilians.After a new wave of U.N. sanctions, on 11 March 2013, North Korea claimed that it had invalidated the 1953 armistice.
On 13 March 2013, North Korea confirmed it ended the 1953 Armistice and declared North Korea "is not restrained by the North-South declaration on non-aggression."
On 30 March 2013, North Korea stated that it had entered a "state of war" with South Korea and declared that "The long-standing situation of the Korean peninsula being neither at peace nor at war is finally over."
Speaking on 4 April 2013, the United States Secretary of Defense, Chuck Hagel, informed the press that Pyongyang had "formally informed" the Pentagon that it had "ratified" the potential usage of a nuclear weapon against South Korea, Japan and the United States of America, including Guam and Hawaii.
Hagel also stated that the US would deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-ballistic missile system to Guam, due to a credible and realistic nuclear threat from North Korea.
How many people were on board the "Lunniy Orbitalny Korabl"?
The Soviet Union had planned to divide their lunar program into two separate manned programs: circumlunar flights in 1967 and lunar landings from 1968.The circumlunar missions were to be launched by a UR-500 rocket, later known as the Proton.
The cosmonauts would be flown to the Moon in the Soyuz 7K-L1 (Zond), which made four unsuccessful unmanned flights between 1967 and 1970.
One flight of the Zond was, however, successful and returned its non-human passengers (tortoises) to Earth; had it been used for a manned circumlunar mission, the flight would have carried two cosmonauts.The Soviet lunar landing missions would use spacecraft derived from the Soyuz 7K-L1.
The orbital module (Soyuz 7K-L3), the ""Lunniy Orbitalny Korabl"" (LOK), had a crew of two.
The LOK and a separate lunar lander, the ""Lunniy Korabl"" (LK), had 40% of the mass of the Apollo CSM/LM due to the launch vehicle's capabilities.The launch vehicle would have been the N1 rocket, which was roughly the same height and takeoff mass as the American Saturn V, exceeded its takeoff thrust by 28%, and yet had roughly half the TLI payload capability.
The N1 was unsuccessfully tested four times, exploding each time due to problems with the first stage's thirty engines.The Soviet leadership cancelled the program in 1970 after the first two successful American Moon landings.
What is the first step in the biosynthesis of J?
The nucleobases are classified into two types: the purines, A and G, being fused five- and six-membered heterocyclic compounds, and the pyrimidines, the six-membered rings C and T. A fifth pyrimidine nucleobase, uracil (U), usually takes the place of thymine in RNA and differs from thymine by lacking a methyl group on its ring.
In addition to RNA and DNA a large number of artificial nucleic acid analogues have also been created to study the properties of nucleic acids, or for use in biotechnology.Uracil is not usually found in DNA, occurring only as a breakdown product of cytosine.
However in a number of bacteriophages – "Bacillus subtilis" bacteriophages PBS1 and PBS2 and "Yersinia" bacteriophage piR1-37 – thymine has been replaced by uracil.
Another phage - Staphylococcal phage S6 - has been identified with a genome where thymine has been replaced by uracil.Base J (beta-d-glucopyranosyloxymethyluracil), a modified form of uracil, is also found in a number of organisms: the flagellates "Diplonema" and "Euglena", and all the kinetoplastid genera Biosynthesis of J occurs in two steps: in the first step a specific thymidine in DNA is converted into hydroxymethyldeoxyuridine; in the second HOMedU is glycosylated to form J. Proteins that bind specifically to this base have been identified.
These proteins appear to be distant relatives of the Tet1 oncogene that is involved in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia.
J appears to act as a termination signal for RNA polymerase II.
When did Last Glacial Maximum happen?
Past precipitation can be estimated in the modern era with the global network of precipitation gauges.
Surface coverage over oceans and remote areas is relatively sparse, but, reducing reliance on interpolation, satellite data has been available since the 1970s.
Quantification of climatological variation of precipitation in prior centuries and epochs is less complete but approximated using proxies such as marine sediments, ice cores, cave stalagmites, and tree rings.Climatological temperatures substantially affect precipitation.
For instance, during the Last Glacial Maximum of 18,000 years ago, thermal-driven evaporation from the oceans onto continental landmasses was low, causing large areas of extreme desert, including polar deserts (cold but with low rates of precipitation).
In contrast, the world's climate was wetter than today near the start of the warm Atlantic Period of 8000 years ago.Estimated global land precipitation increased by approximately 2% over the course of the 20th century, though the calculated trend varies if different time endpoints are chosen, complicated by ENSO and other oscillations, including greater global land precipitation in the 1950s and 1970s than the later 1980s and 1990s despite the positive trend over the century overall.Similar slight overall increase in global river runoff and in average soil moisture has been perceived.
What term describes the ability of a cell to go through numerous cycles of cell division while maintaining the undifferentiated state?
The classical definition of a stem cell requires that it possess two properties:
"Self-renewal": the ability to go through numerous cycles of cell division while maintaining the undifferentiated state.
"Potency": the capacity to differentiate into specialized cell types.
In the strictest sense, this requires stem cells to be either totipotent or pluripotent—to be able to give rise to any mature cell type, although multipotent or unipotent progenitor cells are sometimes referred to as stem cells.
Apart from this it is said that stem cell function is regulated in a feed back mechanism.
What does the term clone mean?
The term "clone" is used in horticulture to refer to descendants of a single plant which were produced by vegetative reproduction or apomixis.
Many horticultural plant cultivars are clones, having been derived from a single individual, multiplied by some process other than sexual reproduction.
As an example, some European cultivars of grapes represent clones that have been propagated for over two millennia.
Other examples are potato and banana.
Grafting can be regarded as cloning, since all the shoots and branches coming from the graft are genetically a clone of a single individual, but this particular kind of cloning has not come under ethical scrutiny and is generally treated as an entirely different kind of operation.Many trees, shrubs, vines, ferns and other herbaceous perennials form clonal colonies naturally.
Parts of an individual plant may become detached by fragmentation and grow on to become separate clonal individuals.
A common example is in the vegetative reproduction of moss and liverwort gametophyte clones by means of gemmae.
Some vascular plants e.g.
dandelion and certain viviparous grasses also form seeds asexually, termed apomixis, resulting in clonal populations of genetically identical individuals.
What are examples of external forcings?
Initial causes of temperature changes (external forcings).The climate system can respond to changes in "external forcings."
External forcings can "push" the climate in the direction of warming or cooling.
Examples of external forcings include changes in atmospheric composition (e.g., increased concentrations of greenhouse gases), solar luminosity, volcanic eruptions, and variations in Earth's orbit around the Sun.
Orbital cycles vary slowly over tens of thousands of years and at present are in an overall cooling trend which would be expected to lead towards an ice age, but the 20th century instrumental temperature record shows a sudden rise in global temperatures.
What characteristic of Mendeleev's periodic table implicitly predicted the properties of elements that had not yet been discovered?
Russian chemistry professor Dmitri Mendeleev and German chemist Julius Lothar Meyer independently published their periodic tables in 1869 and 1870, respectively.
Mendeleev's table was his first published version; that of Meyer was an expanded version of his (Meyer's) table of 1864.
They both constructed their tables by listing the elements in rows or columns in order of atomic weight and starting a new row or column when the characteristics of the elements began to repeat.The recognition and acceptance afforded to Mendeleev's table came from two decisions he made.
The first was to leave gaps in the table when it seemed that the corresponding element had not yet been discovered.
Mendeleev was not the first chemist to do so, but he was the first to be recognized as using the trends in his periodic table to predict the properties of those missing elements, such as gallium and germanium.
The second decision was to occasionally ignore the order suggested by the atomic weights and switch adjacent elements, such as tellurium and iodine, to better classify them into chemical families.
With the development of theories of atomic structure, it became apparent that Mendeleev had unintentionally listed the elements in order of increasing atomic number or nuclear charge.The significance of atomic numbers to the organization of the periodic table was not appreciated until the existence and properties of protons and neutrons became understood.
Mendeleev's periodic tables used atomic weight instead of atomic number to organize the elements, information determinable to fair precision in his time.
Atomic weight worked well enough in most cases to (as noted) give a presentation that was able to predict the properties of missing elements more accurately than any other method then known.
Substitution of atomic numbers, once understood, gave a definitive, integer-based sequence for the elements, still used today even as new synthetic elements are being produced and studied.
What was a problem for classical physics?
Modern physics began in the early 20th century with the work of Max Planck in quantum theory and Albert Einstein's theory of relativity.
Both of these theories came about due to inaccuracies in classical mechanics in certain situations.
Classical mechanics predicted a varying speed of light, which could not be resolved with the constant speed predicted by Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism; this discrepancy was corrected by Einstein's theory of special relativity, which replaced classical mechanics for fast-moving bodies and allowed for a constant speed of light.
Black body radiation provided another problem for classical physics, which was corrected when Planck proposed that light comes in individual packets known as photons; this, along with the photoelectric effect and a complete theory predicting discrete energy levels of electron orbitals, led to the theory of quantum mechanics taking over from classical physics at very small scales.Quantum mechanics would come to be pioneered by Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schrödinger and Paul Dirac.
From this early work, and work in related fields, the Standard Model of particle physics was derived.
Following the discovery of a particle with properties consistent with the Higgs boson at CERN in 2012, all fundamental particles predicted by the standard model, and no others, appear to exist; however physics beyond the Standard Model, with theories such as supersymmetry, is an active area of research.
What process includes the phonoomenon of energy flow in cells?
Foundations of modern biology.Cell theory.Cell theory states that the cell is the fundamental unit of life, and that all living things are composed of one or more cells or the secreted products of those cells (e.g.
shells).
All cells arise from other cells through cell division.
In multicellular organisms, every cell in the organism's body derives ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg.
The cell is also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes.
In addition, the phenomenon of energy flow occurs in cells in processes that are part of the function known as metabolism.
Finally, cells contain hereditary information (DNA), which is passed from cell to cell during cell division.
What are large enzymes that make antibiotics called?
Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of a cell's genome.
When mutations occur, they can either have no effect, alter the product of a gene, or prevent the gene from functioning.
Based on studies in the fly "Drosophila melanogaster", it has been suggested that if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene, this will probably be harmful, with about 70% of these mutations having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial.Mutations can involve large sections of a chromosome becoming duplicated (usually by genetic recombination), which can introduce extra copies of a gene into a genome.
Extra copies of genes are a major source of the raw material needed for new genes to evolve.
This is important because most new genes evolve within gene families from pre-existing genes that share common ancestors.
For example, the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light: three for colour vision and one for night vision; all four are descended from a single ancestral gene.New genes can be generated from an ancestral gene when a duplicate copy mutates and acquires a new function.
This process is easier once a gene has been duplicated because it increases the redundancy of the system; one gene in the pair can acquire a new function while the other copy continues to perform its original function.
Other types of mutations can even generate entirely new genes from previously noncoding DNA.The generation of new genes can also involve small parts of several genes being duplicated, with these fragments then recombining to form new combinations with new functions.
When new genes are assembled from shuffling pre-existing parts, domains act as modules with simple independent functions, which can be mixed together to produce new combinations with new and complex functions.
For example, polyketide synthases are large enzymes that make antibiotics; they contain up to one hundred independent domains that each catalyse one step in the overall process, like a step in an assembly line.
What is primarily the scientific study of the morphology of the adult human body?
Human anatomy.Research and practice.Human anatomy, including gross human anatomy and histology, is primarily the scientific study of the morphology of the adult human body.
It differs from physiology in that anatomy is about the morphology of biological structures, while physiology is the way those structures actually work.Generally, students of certain biological sciences, paramedics, prosthetists and orthotists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nurses, and medical students learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models, skeletons, textbooks, diagrams, photographs, lectures and tutorials, and in addition, medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of dissection and inspection of cadavers.
The study of microscopic anatomy (or histology) can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations (or slides) under a microscope.Human anatomy, physiology and biochemistry are complementary basic medical sciences, which are generally taught to medical students in their first year at medical school.
Human anatomy can be taught regionally or systemically; that is, respectively, studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest, or studying by specific systems, such as the nervous or respiratory systems.
The major anatomy textbook, Gray's Anatomy, has been reorganized from a systems format to a regional format, in line with modern teaching methods.
A thorough working knowledge of anatomy is required by physicians, especially surgeons and doctors working in some diagnostic specialties, such as histopathology and radiology.Academic human anatomists are usually employed by universities, medical schools or teaching hospitals.
They are often involved in teaching anatomy, and research into certain systems, organs, tissues or cells.
What two forms of confirmation bias are under study with respect to astrological belief?
Astrology has been rejected by the scientific community as having no explanatory power for describing the universe.
Scientific testing of astrology has been conducted, and no evidence has been found to support any of the premises or purported effects outlined in astrological traditions.
There is no proposed mechanism of action by which the positions and motions of stars and planets could affect people and events on Earth that does not contradict well understood, basic aspects of biology and physics.The majority of professional astrologers rely on performing astrology-based personality tests and making relevant predictions about the remunerator's future.
Those who continue to have faith in astrology have been characterized as doing so "in spite of the fact that there is no verified scientific basis for their beliefs, and indeed that there is strong evidence to the contrary".It has also been shown that confirmation bias is a psychological factor that contributes to belief in astrology.
Confirmation bias is a form of cognitive bias.
From the literature, Astrology believers often tend to selectively remember those predictions which have turned out to be true, and do not remember those predictions which happen to be false.
Another, separate, form of confirmation bias also plays a role, where believers often fail to distinguish between messages that demonstrate special ability and those which do not.
Thus there are two distinct forms of confirmation bias that are under study with respect to astrological belief.
What is the name for the location where the solar wind collides with the interstellar wind?
The heliosphere is divided into two separate regions.
The solar wind travels at roughly 400 km/s until it collides with the interstellar wind; the flow of plasma in the interstellar medium.
The collision occurs at the termination shock, which is roughly 80–100 AU from the Sun upwind of the interstellar medium and roughly 200 AU from the Sun downwind.
Here the wind slows dramatically, condenses, and becomes more turbulent, forming a great oval structure known as the heliosheath.
This structure is believed to look and behave very much like a comet's tail, extending outward for a further 40 AU on the upwind side but tailing many times that distance downwind; evidence from the Cassini and Interstellar Boundary Explorer spacecraft has suggested that it is forced into a bubble shape by the constraining action of the interstellar magnetic field.
The outer boundary of the heliosphere, the heliopause, is the point at which the solar wind finally terminates and is the beginning of interstellar space.
Both "Voyager 1" and "Voyager 2" are reported to have passed the termination shock and entered the heliosheath, at 94 and 84 AU from the Sun, respectively.
"Voyager 1" is also reported to have reached the heliopause.The shape and form of the outer edge of the heliosphere is likely affected by the fluid dynamics of interactions with the interstellar medium as well as solar magnetic fields prevailing to the south, e.g.
it is bluntly shaped with the northern hemisphere extending 9 AU farther than the southern hemisphere.
Beyond the heliopause, at around 230 AU, lies the bow shock, a plasma "wake" left by the Sun as it travels through the Milky Way.Due to a lack of data, the conditions in local interstellar space are not known for certain.
It is expected that NASA's Voyager spacecraft, as they pass the heliopause, will transmit valuable data on radiation levels and solar wind back to Earth.
How well the heliosphere shields the Solar System from cosmic rays is poorly understood.
A NASA-funded team has developed a concept of a "Vision Mission" dedicated to sending a probe to the heliosphere.
What is an example of a medical study being conducted in space by the National Space Biomedical Research Institute?
Scientific research.Medicine in space.A variety of large-scale medical studies are being conducted in space by the National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI).
Prominent among these is the Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity Study, in which astronauts (including former ISS Commanders Leroy Chiao and Gennady Padalka) perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts to diagnose and potentially treat hundreds of medical conditions in space.
Usually there is no physician on board the International Space Station, and diagnosis of medical conditions is challenging.
Astronauts are susceptible to a variety of health risks including decompression sickness, barotrauma, immunodeficiencies, loss of bone and muscle, orthostatic intolerance due to volume loss, sleep disturbances, and radiation injury.
Ultrasound offers a unique opportunity to monitor these conditions in space.
This study's techniques are now being applied to cover professional and Olympic sports injuries as well as ultrasound performed by non-expert operators in populations such as medical and high school students.
It is anticipated that remote guided ultrasound will have application on Earth in emergency and rural care situations, where access to a trained physician is often rare.
What is one way antisense RNA can act as a binding to an mRNA?
Several types of RNA can downregulate gene expression by being complementary to a part of an mRNA or a gene's DNA.
MicroRNAs (miRNA; 21-22 nt) are found in eukaryotes and act through RNA interference (RNAi), where an effector complex of miRNA and enzymes can cleave complementary mRNA, block the mRNA from being translated, or accelerate its degradation.While small interfering RNAs (siRNA; 20-25 nt) are often produced by breakdown of viral RNA, there are also endogenous sources of siRNAs.
siRNAs act through RNA interference in a fashion similar to miRNAs.
Some miRNAs and siRNAs can cause genes they target to be methylated, thereby decreasing or increasing transcription of those genes.
Animals have Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNA; 29-30 nt) that are active in germline cells and are thought to be a defense against transposons and play a role in gametogenesis.Many prokaryotes have CRISPR RNAs, a regulatory system similar to RNA interference.
Antisense RNAs are widespread; most downregulate a gene, but a few are activators of transcription.
One way antisense RNA can act is by binding to an mRNA, forming double-stranded RNA that is enzymatically degraded.
There are many long noncoding RNAs that regulate genes in eukaryotes, one such RNA is Xist, which coats one X chromosome in female mammals and inactivates it.An mRNA may contain regulatory elements itself, such as riboswitches, in the 5' untranslated region or 3' untranslated region; these cis-regulatory elements regulate the activity of that mRNA.
The untranslated regions can also contain elements that regulate other genes.
What are by far the most abundant biological entities on Earth and outnumber all the others put together?
Viruses are by far the most abundant biological entities on Earth and they outnumber all the others put together.
They infect all types of cellular life including animals, plants, bacteria and fungi.
However, different types of viruses can infect only a limited range of hosts and many are species-specific.
Some, such as smallpox virus for example, can infect only one species – in this case humans, and are said to have a narrow host range.
Other viruses, such as rabies virus, can infect different species of mammals and are said to have a broad range.
The viruses that infect plants are harmless to animals, and most viruses that infect other animals are harmless to humans.
The host range of some bacteriophages is limited to a single strain of bacteria and they can be used to trace the source of outbreaks of infections by a method called phage typing.
What are bacteriophages?
Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria.
Many types of bacteriophage exist, some simply infect and lyse their host bacteria, while others insert into the bacterial chromosome.
A bacteriophage can contain genes that contribute to its host's phenotype: for example, in the evolution of and "Clostridium botulinum", the toxin genes in an integrated phage converted a harmless ancestral bacterium into a lethal pathogen.
Bacteria resist phage infection through restriction modification systems that degrade foreign DNA, and a system that uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that the bacteria have come into contact with in the past, which allows them to block virus replication through a form of RNA interference.
This CRISPR system provides bacteria with acquired immunity to infection.
How are kefir and kumis made?
Root beer and other sweet carbonated beverages can be produced using the same methods as beer, except the fermentation is stopped sooner, producing carbon dioxide, but only trace amounts of alcohol, and a significant amount of sugar is left in the drink.
"Kvass", a fermented drink made from rye, is popular in Eastern Europe; it has a recognizable, but low alcoholic content.
Yeast in symbiosis with acetic acid bacteria is used in the preparation of "kombucha", a fermented sweetened tea.
Species of yeasts found in the tea can vary, and may include: "Brettanomyces bruxellensis", "Candida stellata", "Schizosaccharomyces pombe", "Torulaspora delbrueckii" and "Zygosaccharomyces bailii".
"Kombucha" is a popular beverage in Eastern Europe and some former Soviet republics under the name "chajnyj grib" (Чайный гриб), which means "tea mushroom".
"Kefir" and "kumis" are made by fermenting milk with yeast and bacteria.
Who started development of the first electron microscope in 1931 which was the transmission electron microscope (TEM)?
In the early 1900s a significant alternative to light microscopy was developed, using electrons rather than light to generate the image.
Ernst Ruska started development of the first electron microscope in 1931 which was the transmission electron microscope (TEM).
The transmission electron microscope works on the same principle as an optical microscope but uses electrons in the place of light and electromagnets in the place of glass lenses.
Use of electrons instead of light allows a much higher resolution.Development of the transmission electron microscope was quickly followed in 1935 by the development of the scanning electron microscope by Max Knoll.Electron microscopes quickly became popular following the Second World War.
Ernst Ruska, working at Siemens developed the first commercial transmission electron microscope and major scientific conferences on electron microscopy started being held in the 1950s.
In 1965 the first commercial scanning electron microscope was developed by Professor Sir Charles Oatley and his postgraduate student Gary Stewart and marketed by the Cambridge Instrument Company as the "Stereoscan".
What is the maximum physical size limit for refracting telescopes?
The earliest recorded working telescopes were the refracting telescopes that appeared in the Netherlands in 1608.
Their development is credited to three individuals: Hans Lippershey and Zacharias Janssen, who were spectacle makers in Middelburg, and Jacob Metius of Alkmaar.
Galileo heard about the Dutch telescope in June 1609, built his own within a month, and greatly improved upon the design in the following year.The idea that the objective, or light-gathering element, could be a mirror instead of a lens was being investigated soon after the invention of the refracting telescope.
The potential advantages of using parabolic mirrors—reduction of spherical aberration and no chromatic aberration—led to many proposed designs and several attempts to build reflecting telescopes.
In 1668, Isaac Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope, of a design which now bears his name, the Newtonian reflector.The invention of the achromatic lens in 1733 partially corrected color aberrations present in the simple lens and enabled the construction of shorter, more functional refracting telescopes.
Reflecting telescopes, though not limited by the color problems seen in refractors, were hampered by the use of fast tarnishing speculum metal mirrors employed during the 18th and early 19th century—a problem alleviated by the introduction of silver coated glass mirrors in 1857, and aluminized mirrors in 1932.
The maximum physical size limit for refracting telescopes is about 1 meter (40 inches), dictating that the vast majority of large optical researching telescopes built since the turn of the 20th century have been reflectors.
The largest reflecting telescopes currently have objectives larger than 10 m (33 feet).The 20th century also saw the development of telescopes that worked in a wide range of wavelengths from radio to gamma-rays.
The first purpose built radio telescope went into operation in 1937.
Since then, a tremendous variety of complex astronomical instruments have been developed.
What did Bekenstein propose about black holes?
Open questions.Entropy and thermodynamics.In 1971, Hawking showed under general conditions that the total area of the event horizons of any collection of classical black holes can never decrease, even if they collide and merge.
This result, now known as the second law of black hole mechanics, is remarkably similar to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy of a system can never decrease.
As with classical objects at absolute zero temperature, it was assumed that black holes had zero entropy.
If this were the case, the second law of thermodynamics would be violated by entropy-laden matter entering a black hole, resulting in a decrease of the total entropy of the universe.
Therefore, Bekenstein proposed that a black hole should have an entropy, and that it should be proportional to its horizon area.The link with the laws of thermodynamics was further strengthened by Hawking's discovery that quantum field theory predicts that a black hole radiates blackbody radiation at a constant temperature.
This seemingly causes a violation of the second law of black hole mechanics, since the radiation will carry away energy from the black hole causing it to shrink.
The radiation, however also carries away entropy, and it can be proven under general assumptions that the sum of the entropy of the matter surrounding a black hole and one quarter of the area of the horizon as measured in Planck units is in fact always increasing.
This allows the formulation of the first law of black hole mechanics as an analogue of the first law of thermodynamics, with the mass acting as energy, the surface gravity as temperature and the area as entropy.One puzzling feature is that the entropy of a black hole scales with its area rather than with its volume, since entropy is normally an extensive quantity that scales linearly with the volume of the system.
This odd property led Gerard 't Hooft and Leonard Susskind to propose the holographic principle, which suggests that anything that happens in a volume of spacetime can be described by data on the boundary of that volume.Although general relativity can be used to perform a semi-classical calculation of black hole entropy, this situation is theoretically unsatisfying.
In statistical mechanics, entropy is understood as counting the number of microscopic configurations of a system that have the same macroscopic qualities (such as mass, charge, pressure, etc.).
Without a satisfactory theory of quantum gravity, one cannot perform such a computation for black holes.
Some progress has been made in various approaches to quantum gravity.
In 1995, Andrew Strominger and Cumrun Vafa showed that counting the microstates of a specific supersymmetric black hole in string theory reproduced the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy.
Since then, similar results have been reported for different black holes both in string theory and in other approaches to quantum gravity like loop quantum gravity.
What is diffuse nebulae?
Most nebulae can be described as diffuse nebulae, which means that they are extended and contain no well-defined boundaries.
In visible light these nebulae may be divided into emission and reflection nebulae.
Emission nebulae emit spectral line radiation from ionized gas (mostly ionized hydrogen); they are often called HII regions (the term "HII" is used in professional astronomy to refer to ionized hydrogen).Reflection nebulae themselves do not emit significant amounts of visible light, but are near stars and reflect light from them.
Similar nebulae not illuminated by stars do not exhibit visible radiation, but may be detected as opaque clouds blocking light from luminous objects behind them; they are called "dark nebulae".Although these nebulae have different visibility at optical wavelengths, they are all bright sources of infrared emission, chiefly from dust within the nebulae.
What is the width of the mangetosphere of the Earth?
The Earth is constantly immersed in the solar wind, a rarefied flow of hot plasma (gas of free electrons and positive ions) emitted by the Sun in all directions, a result of the two-million-degree heat of the Sun's outermost layer, the corona.
The solar wind usually reaches Earth with a velocity around 400 km/s, density around 5 ions/cm3 and magnetic field intensity around 2–5 nT (nanoteslas; Earth's surface field is typically 30,000–50,000 nT).
These are typical values.
During magnetic storms, in particular, flows can be several times faster; the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) may also be much stronger.The IMF originates on the Sun, related to the field of sunspots, and its field lines (lines of force) are dragged out by the solar wind.
That alone would tend to line them up in the Sun-Earth direction, but the rotation of the Sun skews them (at Earth) by about 45 degrees, so that field lines passing Earth may actually start near the western edge ("limb") of the visible Sun.Earth's magnetosphere is formed by the impact of the solar wind on the Earth's magnetic field.
It forms an obstacle to the solar wind, diverting it, at an average distance of about 70,000 km (11 Earth radii or Re), forming a bow shock 12,000 km to 15,000 km (1.9 to 2.4 Re) further upstream.
The width of the magnetosphere abreast of Earth, is typically 190,000 km (30 Re), and on the night side a long "magnetotail" of stretched field lines extends to great distances (> 200 Re).The magnetosphere is full of trapped plasma as the solar wind passes the Earth.
The flow of plasma into the magnetosphere increases with increases in solar wind density and speed, with increase in the southward component of the IMF and with increases in turbulence in the solar wind flow.
The flow pattern of magnetospheric plasma is from the magnetotail toward the Earth, around the Earth and back into the solar wind through the magnetopause on the day-side.
In addition to moving perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field, some magnetospheric plasma travel down along the Earth's magnetic field lines and lose energy to the atmosphere in the auroral zones.
Magnetospheric electrons accelerated downward by field-aligned electric fields cause the bright aurora features.
The un-accelerated electrons and ions cause the dim glow of the diffuse aurora.
What is the traditional definition of a "soft taco"?
Traditionally, soft-shelled tacos referred to corn tortillas that were cooked to a softer state than a hard taco - usually by grilling or steaming.
More recently the term has come to include flour tortilla based tacos mostly from large manufacturers and restaurant chains.
In this context, "soft tacos" are tacos made with wheat flour tortillas and filled with the same ingredients as a hard taco.
What is a Hawaiian hamburger?
In Mexico, burgers (called "hamburguesas") are served with ham and slices of American cheese (locally called "queso americano") fried on top of the meat patty.
The toppings include avocado, jalapeño slices, shredded lettuce, onion and tomato.
The bun has mayonnaise, ketchup and mustard.
In certain parts are served with bacon, which can be fried or grilled along with the meat patty.
A slice of pineapple is also a usual option, and the variation is known as a "Hawaiian hamburger".Some restaurants' burgers also have barbecue sauce, and others also replace the ground patty with sirloin, Al pastor meat, barbacoa or a fried chicken breast.
Many burger chains from the United States can be found all over Mexico, including Carl's Jr., Sonic, as well as global chains such as McDonald's and Burger King.
How are tornado fries made?
Tornado fries are made by skewering the whole potato, and then cutting with a specialized spiral slicer.
The potato is spread evenly along the skewer and deep fried.
The cooking process fuses the potato to the skewer and holds it in place.
It is then sprinkled with dry seasonings or served with dipping sauce.
Tornado fries gets their name from the tornado-like shape that the potato has on the skewer.
What was saussage casing originally made from?
Traditionally, sausage casings were made of the cleaned intestines, or stomachs in the case of haggis and other traditional puddings.
Today, however, natural casings are often replaced by collagen, cellulose, or even plastic casings, especially in the case of industrially manufactured sausages.
Some forms of sausage, such as sliced sausage, are prepared without a casing.
Additionally, luncheon meat and sausage meat are now available without casings in tin cans and jars.
What type of online club has Bobby Flay endorsed?
 mania.The United States and Canada have seen an increase in the popularity of bacon and bacon related recipes, dubbed "bacon mania".
The sale of bacon in the U.S. has increased significantly since 2011.
Sales climbed 9.5% in 2013, making it an all-time high of nearly $4 billion in U.S.
In a survey conducted by Smithfield, 65% of Americans would support bacon as their "national food."
Dishes such as bacon explosion, chicken fried bacon, and chocolate-covered bacon have been popularised over the internet, as has using candied bacon.
Recipes spread quickly through both countries' national media, culinary blogs, and YouTube.
Restaurants have organized and are organizing bacon and beer tasting nights, "The New York Times" reported on bacon infused with Irish whiskey used for Saint Patrick's Day cocktails, and celebrity chef Bobby Flay has endorsed a "Bacon of the Month" club online, in print, and on national television.Commentators explain this surging interest in bacon by reference to what they deem American cultural characteristics.
Sarah Hepola, in a 2008 article in Salon.com, suggests a number of reasons, one of them being that eating bacon in the modern, health-conscious world is an act of rebellion: "Loving bacon is like shoving a middle finger in the face of all that is healthy and holy while an unfiltered cigarette smoulders between your lips."
She also suggests bacon is sexy (with a reference to Sarah Katherine Lewis' book "Sex and Bacon"), kitsch, and funny.
Hepola concludes by saying that "Bacon is American".Alison Cook, writing in the "Houston Chronicle", argues the case of bacon's American citizenship by referring to historical and geographical uses of bacon.
Early American literature echoes the sentiment—in Ebenezer Cooke's 1708 poem "The Sot-Weed Factor", a satire of life in early colonial America, the narrator already complains that practically all the food in America was bacon-infused.
What meats are traditionally used to make Chuanr?
Chuanr (), often referred to as "chua'r" in Pekingese and throughout the North, or kawap (كاۋاپ) in Uyghur, is a variation of kebab originating from the Uyghurs in the Western province of Xinjiang and a popular dish in Chinese Islamic cuisine.
The dish has since spread across the rest of the country and become a popular street food.Although the most traditional form of chuanr uses lamb or mutton, other types of meat, such as chicken, beef, pork, and seafood, may be used as well.
Small pieces of meat are skewered and either roasted or deep-fried.
Common spices and condiments include cumin called "ziran", pepper, sesame, and sesame oil.During Chinese New Year, it is common to find fruit kebabs candied and covered with a hard candy sugar coating.
At the famous Wángfǔjǐng in Beijing, it is very common to find many kinds of fruit kebabs of everything from bananas, strawberries, and seasonal Chinese fruits, as well as scorpions, squids, and various Japanese-flavored kebabs all year long.
What was "kansui" named after?
Most noodles are made from four basic ingredients: wheat flour, salt, water, and "kansui", which is essentially a type of alkaline mineral water, containing sodium carbonate and usually potassium carbonate, as well as sometimes a small amount of phosphoric acid.
Originally, "kansui" was named after the water from Inner Mongolia's Lake Kan which contained large amounts of these minerals and was said to be perfect for making these noodles.
Making noodles with "kansui" lends them a yellowish hue as well as a firm texture.
Eggs may also be substituted for "kansui".
Some noodles are made with neither eggs nor "kansui" and should only be used for yakisoba.Ramen comes in various shapes and lengths.
It may be thick, thin, or even ribbon-like, as well as straight or wrinkled.
What does Hadaka udon refer to?
 "Zaru udon": Chilled udon noodles topped with shredded nori and served on a zaru (笊 or ざる), a sieve-like bamboo tray.
Accompanied by a chilled dipping sauce, usually a strong mixture of dashi, mirin, and shoyu.
Eaten with wasabi or grated ginger.
 "Bukkake udon": Cold udon served with thick dashi-broth.
 "Hadaka udon" (naked udon 裸うどん): Cold udon served on its own.
 Kijoyu udon: Served in a cold soup of raw (unpasteurized) soy sauce and sudachi (a type of citrus) juice, sometimes with a bit of grated daikon.
Where was rice imported from to the Classical world?
Rice was known to the Classical world, being imported from Egypt, and perhaps west Asia.
It was known to Greece by returning soldiers from Alexander the Great's military expedition to Asia.
Large deposits of rice from the first century A.D. have been found in Roman camps in Germany.The Moors brought Asiatic rice to the Iberian Peninsula in the 10th century.
Records indicate it was grown in Valencia and Majorca.
In Majorca, rice cultivation seems to have stopped after the Christian conquest, although historians are not certain.Muslims also brought rice to Sicily, where it was an important crop long before it is noted in the plain of Pisa (1468) or in the Lombard plain (1475), where its cultivation was promoted by Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, and demonstrated in his model farms.After the 15th century, rice spread throughout Italy and then France, later propagating to all the continents during the age of European exploration.In European Russia, a short-grain, starchy rice similar to the Italian varieties, has been grown in the Krasnodar Krai, and known in Russia as "Kuban Rice" or "Krasnodar Rice".
In the Russian Far East several "japonica" cultivars are grown in Primorye around the Khanka lake.
Increasing scale of rice production in the region has recently brought criticism towards growers' alleged bad practices in regards to the environment.
How do you generally cook a fish steak?
A steak (from Old Norse "steik", "roast") is generally a cut of beef sliced perpendicular to the muscle fibers, or of fish cut perpendicular to the spine.
Meat steaks are usually grilled, pan-fried, or broiled, while fish steaks may also be baked.Steak can also be meat cooked in sauce, such as steak and kidney pie, or minced meat formed into a steak shape, such as Salisbury steak and hamburger steak.
Without qualification, the word "steak" generally refers to beefsteak.
Steaks from other animals are usually qualified as, "e.g.
", 'swordfish steak' or 'venison steak'.
What distinguishes a Main course salad from an Appetizer salad?
Salad is a popular ready-to-eat dish often containing leafy vegetables, usually served chilled or at a moderate temperature and often served with a sauce or dressing.
Salads may also contain ingredients such as fruit, grain, meat, seafood and sweets.
Though many salads use raw ingredients, some use cooked ingredients.Most salads are served cold, although some, such as south German potato salad, are served warm.
Some consider the warmth of a dish a factor that excludes it from the salad category calling the warm mixture a casserole, a sandwich topping or more specifically, name it for the ingredients which comprise it.
Leafy vegetable salads are generally served with a dressing, as well as various garnishes such as nuts or croutons, and sometimes with meat, fish, pasta, cheese, eggs, or whole grains.Salads may be served at any point during a meal, such as:
Appetizer salads, light salads to stimulate the appetite as the first course of the meal.
Side salads, to accompany the main course as a side dish.
Main course salads, usually containing a portion of heartier fare, such as chicken breast or slices of beef.
Palate-cleansing salads, to settle the stomach after the main course.
Dessert salads, sweet versions often containing fruit, gelatin and/or whipped cream.
How is popcorn often served in Peru?
Popcorn is commonly eaten in movie theaters.
This snack is usually served salted or sweetened.
In North America, it is traditionally served salted, often with butter or a butterlike topping, with toffee or spices.
However, sweetened versions, such as caramel corn and kettle corn, are also commonly available.
In the United Kingdom, ready-made popcorn is available either salted or simply sweetened with sugar.
Toffee (i.e.
caramel) popcorn is also available, but tends to be more expensive.
In Peru, popcorn is sometimes sweetened with small candy pellets and sweetened condensed milk, but its more often eaten with salt and the only buttered version known to any considerable degree is microwave popcorn.
In Mexico, popcorn is served with either jalapeño juice, hot sauce, cheese, butter, or salt.
Popcorn is a popular snack food at sporting events and in cinemas, where it has been served since 1914.Popcorn as a breakfast cereal was consumed by Americans in the 1800s and generally consisted of popcorn with milk and a sweetener.Popcorn balls (popped kernels stuck together with a sugary "glue") were hugely popular around the turn of the 20th century, but their popularity has since waned.
Popcorn balls are still served in some places as a traditional Halloween treat.
Cracker Jack is a popular, commercially produced candy that consists of peanuts mixed in with caramel-covered popcorn.
Kettle corn is a variation of normal popcorn, cooked with white sugar and salt, traditionally in a large copper kettle.
Once reserved for specialty shops and county fairs, kettle corn has recently become popular, especially in the microwave popcorn market.
The popcorn maker is a relatively new home appliance, and its popularity is increasing because it offers the opportunity to add flavours of the consumer's own choice and to choose healthy-eating popcorn styles.Some popular brands of popcorn in the United States are Orville Redenbacher's, Act II, Jiffy Pop (all three of which are brands of the ConAgra Foods conglomerate), Pop Secret, Candy Land Gourmet, Jolly Time, Aussie Crunch, Newman's Own, Dale and Thomas and Pop Weaver.
Where does the word "cake" come from?
The term "cake" has a long history.
The word itself is of Viking origin, from the Old Norse word "kaka".Although clear examples of the difference between cake and bread are easy to find, the precise classification has always been elusive.
For example, banana bread may be properly considered either a quick bread or a cake.The Greeks invented beer as a leavener, frying fritters in olive oil, and cheesecakes using goat's milk.
In ancient Rome, basic bread dough was sometimes enriched with butter, eggs, and honey, which produced a sweet and cake-like baked good.
Latin poet Ovid refers to the birthday of him and his brother with party and cake in his first book of exile, "Tristia".Early cakes in England were also essentially bread: the most obvious differences between a "cake" and "bread" were the round, flat shape of the cakes, and the cooking method, which turned cakes over once while cooking, while bread was left upright throughout the baking process.Sponge cakes, leavened with beaten eggs, originated during the Renaissance, possibly in Spain.
What is used to freeze and harden ice cream?
Using liquid nitrogen to freeze ice cream is an old idea and has been used for many years to harden ice cream.
The use of liquid nitrogen in the primary freezing of ice cream, that is to effect the transition from the liquid to the frozen state without the use of a conventional ice cream freezer, has only recently started to see commercialization.
Some commercial innovations have been documented in the National Cryogenic Society Magazine "Cold Facts".
The most noted brands are Dippin' Dots, Blue Sky Creamery, Project Creamery, and Sub Zero Cryo Creamery.
The preparation results in a column of white condensed water vapor cloud, reminiscent of popular depictions of witches' cauldrons.
The ice cream, dangerous to eat while still "steaming", is allowed to rest until the liquid nitrogen is completely vaporised.
Sometimes ice cream is frozen to the sides of the container, and must be allowed to thaw.Making ice cream with liquid nitrogen has advantages over conventional freezing.
Due to the rapid freezing, the crystal grains are smaller, giving the ice cream a creamier texture, and allowing one to get the same texture by using less milkfat.
Such ice crystals will grow very quickly via the processes of recrystallization, thereby obviating the original benefits unless steps are taken to inhibit ice crystal growth.For similar reasons, good results can also be achieved with the more readily available "dry ice" and authors such as Heston Blumenthal have published recipes to produce ice cream and sorbet using a simple blender.
Is it possible to produce genuine yogurt from plant sources?
Various manufacturers have endeavoured to produce plant-based substitutes for yogurt, using soy milk, nut milks such as almond milk, and coconut milk, for consumers who are unable to tolerate dairy products in any form.
Although "Lactobacillus" strains exist that can produce lactic acid from plant-derived feed stock ("e.g."
sauerkraut), since plants do not produce lactose, it is not possible to produce genuine yogurt from plant sources with the same bacteria cultures used to convert milk into yogurt.
What do animals skins and organs do?
History.Origins.Cheese is an ancient food whose origins predate recorded history.
There is no conclusive evidence indicating where cheesemaking originated, either in Europe, Central Asia or the Middle East, but the practice had spread within Europe prior to Roman times and, according to Pliny the Elder, had become a sophisticated enterprise by the time the Roman Empire came into being.The earliest evidence of cheese-making in the archaeological record dates back to 5,500 BCE, in what is now Kujawy, Poland, where strainers with milk fats molecules have been found.
Earliest proposed dates for the origin of cheesemaking range from around 8000 BCE, when sheep were first domesticated.
Since animal skins and inflated internal organs have, since ancient times, provided storage vessels for a range of foodstuffs, it is probable that the process of cheese making was discovered accidentally by storing milk in a container made from the stomach of an animal, resulting in the milk being turned to curd and whey by the rennet from the stomach.
There is a legend – with variations – about the discovery of cheese by an Arab trader who used this method of storing milk.Cheesemaking may have begun independently of this by the pressing and salting of curdled milk to preserve it.
Observation that the effect of making milk in an animal stomach gave more solid and better-textured curds may have led to the deliberate addition of rennet.Early archeological evidence of Egyptian cheese has been found in Egyptian tomb murals, dating to about 2000 BCE.
The earliest cheeses were likely to have been quite sour and salty, similar in texture to rustic cottage cheese or feta, a crumbly, flavorful Greek cheese.Cheese produced in Europe, where climates are cooler than the Middle East, required less salt for preservation.
With less salt and acidity, the cheese became a suitable environment for useful microbes and molds, giving aged cheeses their respective flavors.
What is the sun cultivation method?
Originally, coffee farming was done in the shade of trees that provided a habitat for many animals and insects.
Remnant forest trees were used for this purpose, but many species have been planted as well.
These include leguminous trees of the genera "Acacia", "Albizia", "Cassia", "Erythrina", "Gliricidia", "Inga", and "Leucaena", as well as the nitrogen-fixing non-legume sheoaks of the genus "Casuarina", and the silky oak "Grevillea robusta".This method commonly referred to as the traditional shaded method, or "shade-grown".
Starting in the 1970s, many farmers switched their production method to sun cultivation, in which coffee is grown in rows under full sun with little or no forest canopy.
This causes berries to ripen more rapidly and bushes to produce higher yields, but requires the clearing of trees and increased use of fertilizer and pesticides, which damage the environment and cause health problems.Unshaded coffee plants grown with fertilizer yield the most coffee, although unfertilized shaded crops generally yield more than unfertilized unshaded crops: the response to fertilizer is much greater in full sun.
Although traditional coffee production causes berries to ripen more slowly and produce lower yields, the quality of the coffee is allegedly superior.
In addition, the traditional shaded method provides living space for many wildlife species.
Proponents of shade cultivation say environmental problems such as deforestation, pesticide pollution, habitat destruction, and soil and water degradation are the side effects of the practices employed in sun cultivation.The American Birding Association, Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center, National Arbor Day Foundation, and the Rainforest Alliance have led a campaign for 'shade-grown' and organic coffees, which can be sustainably harvested.
Shaded coffee cultivation systems show greater biodiversity than full-sun systems, and those more distant from continuous forest compare rather poorly to undisturbed native forest in terms of habitat value for some bird species.Another issue concerning coffee is its use of water.
According to "New Scientist", using industrial farming practices, it takes about of water to grow the coffee seeds needed to produce one cup of coffee, and the coffee is often grown in countries where there is a water shortage, such as Ethiopia.By using sustainable agriculture methods, the amount of water usage can be dramatically reduced, while retaining comparable yields.
For comparison, the United States Geological Survey reports that one egg requires an input of of water; one serving of milk requires an input of of water; one serving of rice requires an input of of water; and one glass of wine requires an input of of water.Coffee grounds may be used for composting or as a mulch.
They are especially appreciated by worms and acid-loving plants such as blueberries.
Some commercial coffee shops run initiatives to make better use of these grounds, including Starbucks' "Grounds for your Garden" project, and community sponsored initiatives such as "Ground to Ground".Starbucks sustainability chief Jim Hanna has warned that Climate change may significantly impact coffee yields within a few decades.
What is juice?
Juice is a liquid that is naturally contained in fruit and vegetables.
It can also refer to liquids that are flavored with these or other biological food sources such as meat and seafood.
It is commonly consumed as a beverage or used as an ingredient or flavoring in foods.
For which film was "Rolling In the Deep" used in the advertising trailer?
"Rolling in the Deep" first gained attention when it was used in a trailer for the film "I Am Number Four" and in the film itself.
It has since been featured in several television series such as in "90210" third season, in "Doctor Who" sixth series premiere, in "One Tree Hill" eighth season, in "Gossip Girl" fourth season finale, and in "The Secret Life of the American Teenager" fourth season.
"Rolling in the Deep" was used as the theme song for E4's reality series "Made in Chelsea" and appeared in "So You Think You Can Dance" eighth season during contestant Mitchell Kelly's solo performance.The instrumental of the song was used in Apple Inc's marketing video for the iPhone 4S.
It was also featured in CBC's intro to Game 1 of the hockey 2011 Stanley Cup Finals between the Vancouver Canucks and the Boston Bruins.
while the song's instrumentals were played heavily in promos during the 2011 NBA Draft.
The song was played in the background during the parade of athletes at the 2012 Summer Olympic Games.
How much did Psy earn from Gangnam Style?
Record executives in the music industry believe that music charts will increasingly be filled with YouTube-driven globalised acts from foreign countries.
Sean Carey, a research fellow in the School of Social Sciences at the University of Roehampton, wrote that the flow of popular music will no longer be a single traffic route from North America and Europe to other parts of the globe, but will also move the other way as well.
According to Adam Sherwin from "The Independent", the global web demand for Gangnam Style had short-circuited the "traditional reluctance" of radio stations to play foreign-language songs.
The song is also underlining a shift in how money is being made in the music business.
Although Psy earned more than US$60,000 from music sales of "Gangnam Style" in South Korea alone, he and his music label YG Entertainment have raked in almost US$1 million from advertisements which appear on YouTube videos identified for using "Gangnam Style" in its content.
The "Harvard Business Review" published an article written by Kevin Evers, who explained how "Gangnam Style" had changed Billboard's ranking methodology of its music charts.
Instead of relying solely on radio plays and paid purchases, Billboard started to place a heavier emphasis on digital sales and YouTube views.
As a result of the change, Gangnam Style moved up to the top position of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs music chart.
According to the British Phonographic Industry's report based on Official Charts Company sales data, thanks to Psy's song and Carly Rae Jepsen’s "Call Me Maybe," pop became the UK’s favourite musical genre of the year, taking the lion’s share of the singles market (38.5%) in 2012.
Who has choral arrangements on "Across the Universe", "I Me Mine" and "The Long and Winding Road"?

In what categories was "Hey Jude" nominated for grammy in 1969?
Upon the release of the "Hey Jude" single, "Time" contrasted it with its B-side "Revolution."
"Time" wrote, "The other side of the new disk urges activism of a different sort" due to McCartney "liltingly exhorta friend to overcome his fears and commit himself in love."
Robert Christgau of "The Village Voice" called it "one of his truest and most forthright love songs" and was critical of its omission from "The Beatles".
Music analyst Alan Pollack praised "Hey Jude," saying, "it's such a good illustration of two compositional lessons—how to fill a large canvas with simple means, and how to use diverse elements such as harmony, bassline, and orchestration to articulate form and contrast."
He also said it is unusual for a long song because it uses a "binary form that combines a fully developed, hymn-like song together with an extended, mantra-like jam on a simple chord progression."
Pollack described the song's long coda and fadeout as "an astonishingly transcendental effect," while Unterberger observed, "What could have very easily been boring is instead hypnotic".
John Lennon said "Hey Jude" was "one of his [Paul's masterpieces.
""Hey Jude" was nominated for the Grammy Awards of 1969 in the Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal categories but failed to win any of them.
It did win the 1968 Ivor Novello Award for "A-Side With the Highest Sales".
In the 1968 "NME" Readers' Poll, "Hey Jude" was named the best single of the year.
In 2001, "Hey Jude" was inducted into the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Grammy Hall of Fame.In 2004 and later in 2010, "Rolling Stone" ranked the song at number eight on "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time," making it the highest ranked Beatles song on the list.
Also in 2010, "Rolling Stone" ranked the song at number seven on the Beatles' 100 Greatest Songs.
It came in third on Channel 4's list of 100 Greatest Singles.
The Amusement & Music Operators Association ranked "Hey Jude" the 11th-best jukebox single of all time.
It was also voted the greatest song of all time by "Mojo" readers.
Who taught the oboe in the "small, rather stuffy music room" in the basement where Lennon and McCartney sat at the piano and composed 'I Want to Hold Your Hand'?
Although it is said that Brian Epstein had encouraged Lennon and McCartney to write a song to appeal to American listeners this has been denied by George Martin.
McCartney had recently moved into 57 Wimpole Street, London, where he was living as a guest of Dr Richard and Margaret Asher, whose daughter, actress Jane Asher, had become McCartney’s girlfriend after meeting him earlier in the year.
This location briefly became Lennon and McCartney's new writing base, taking over from McCartney’s Forthlin Road home in Liverpool.
Margaret Asher taught the oboe in the "small, rather stuffy music room" in the basement where Lennon and McCartney sat at the piano and composed 'I Want to Hold Your Hand'.
In September 1980, Lennon told "Playboy" magazine:In 1994, McCartney agreed with Lennon's description of the circumstances surrounding the composition of "I Want to Hold Your Hand", saying:
How long is Every Breath You Take?
7": A&M / AM 117
 "Every Breath You Take" – 4:13
 "Murder By Numbers" – 4:31
2x7": A&M / AM 117
 "Every Breath You Take" – 4:13
 "Murder By Numbers" – 4:31
 "Man In A Suitcase" (live) – 2:18
 "Truth Hits Everybody '83" -3:34

What was the origin of "Free Bird"
It has become something of a humorous tradition for audience members at concerts to shout "Free Bird" as a request to hear the song, regardless of the performer or style of music.
The phenomenon began earlier in the 1970s with The Allman Brothers Band's epic "Whipping Post", but then took off to a much greater extent with "Free Bird", which was very popular by 1979.
This can be traced back to Skynyrd's first live album, 1976's "One More from the Road".
For their second encore, Van Zant asked the crowd, "What song is it you wanna hear?
", which was immediately followed by several shouts of "Free Bird", to which the band responded with a 14-minute rendition of the song.
The spoken interaction was reproduced on the album as an introduction to the song.

Who  enters a pool of water next to him and in the end of the video, he gets out of the water, rises on his feet and looks up at the camera as it zooms out overhead?
There are two music videos: one for UK, one for the US.In the music video for UK, Gary Lightbody lies on open ground as cameras film him from different angles.
It starts raining, splashing his face and hands.
Gary enters a pool of water next to him and in the end of the video, he gets out of the water, rises on his feet and looks up at the camera as it zooms out overhead.In the US music video, Lightbody is shown lying down in busy places while singing.
People ignore him and step over him.
Among the places he lies are a diner, an intersection, at the top of an escalator, in a subway car, at the top of a hill overlooking a highway, and at the end on a bed.
Which song was listed number 8 on "Village Voice"'s Pazz and Jop list?
Reception.Critical response.Critics were very positive in their reviews of the song.
In the "Entertainment Weekly" review of the album, critic Chris Willman wrote: "Take the title track ... on which imagines himself as a paranoid monarch.
'Who would ever want to be king?'
Martin asks.
'Revolutionaries wait/For my head on a silver plate!'.
The confident majesty of the music, however, belies how he and his bandmates have invigorated their rock-lite reign."
Josh Hathaway from "The Plain Dealer" noted "Viva la Vida" as the "catchiest" song on the album.
Chris Jones of the BBC noted: "The string/brass mutations that bolster a track like 'Viva La Vida' ... conjure tunes so sweetly melancholy."
In the IGN review, critic Chad Grischow wrote, "It is their one and only foray into unabashed orchestral pop, but the punchy strut of the strings and fantastic marching vocals make it far too charming and lively to dislike, and even harder not to love.
""Viva la Vida" was nominated for "Record of the Year", and won "Song of the Year", and "Best Pop Performance by a Duo or a Group" at the 2009 Grammy Awards.
This song also won the Ivor Novello Award for "Best Selling British Single".

"Viva la Vida" has been sampled in several other songs including Flo Rida's single "Be on You".
Where were the vocals for Eminem's "Love the Way You Lie" recorded?
Mike Strange recorded and mixed Eminem's vocals at Effigy Studios in Ferndale, Michigan.
The sessions took two days.
Strange edited the vocals with D-Verb—a reverberation software—and an Extra Long Delay plug-in.
He preferred to make few changes; for "Love the Way You Lie" he almost exclusively used board compression and console equalization.
Strange used the Bricasti and Eventide Reverb 2016 mixing tools for "brighter" reverberation.
Detroit musician Luis Resto has contributed to the arrangement on many of Eminem's songs, but did not do so for "Love the Way You Lie".
According to Strange, "Everything we needed was already in the track, apart from the vocals."
Two to three weeks after the sessions, Alex da Kid arrived to help mix and master the track.
He wanted to replace the acoustic guitar on the demo, but Eminem chose to keep it.
Strange said, "It was simply a matter of trying to match and then to improve on the demo da Kid'd sent us."
Strange's brother Joe engineered the track.Rihanna's recording sessions took place at Sun Studios in Dublin, Ireland.
Marcos Tovar mixed her vocals, which were engineered by Spike Lindsey and mastered from Detroit over the Internet.
The American songwriter Makeba Riddick provided additional vocal production.
Strange used equalization, compression and reverberation but left the vocal balance.
He assumed that Rihanna was satisfied with her recorded vocals and did not make major changes on her seven stereo vocal tracks.
What year was all I want for Christmas released?
When the song was first released as a single in 1994, no remixes were commissioned.
Carey re-released the song commercially in Japan in 2000, with a new remix known as the So So Def remix.
The remix contains new vocals and is played over a harder, more urban beat; it features raps by Jermaine Dupri and Bow Wow.
The remix appears on Carey's compilation album "Greatest Hits" (2001) as a bonus track.
In 2009, a remix produced by Carey and Low Sunday, called "Mariah's New Dance Mix", was released.
The mix laid the original 1994 vocals over new electronic instrumentation.
The remix garnered a positive response.
MTV's Kyle Anderson wrote that "it's difficult to improve perfection," but that the remix "does dress up the song in a disco thump that should make your office Christmas party 28 percent funkier than it was last year."
Idolator's Becky Bain praised the song's catchiness.In 2010, Carey re-recorded the song for her thirteenth studio and second holiday album, "Merry Christmas II You".
Titled "All I Want for Christmas Is You (Extra Festive)", the new version featured re-recorded vocals, softer bell ringing and stronger drumming, and an orchestral introduction that replaced the a capella introduction.
Steven J. Horowitz from "Rap-Up" wrote that the new version "sound just as enjoyable as it did in 1994."
While the song was praised, it drew criticism for being too similar to the original.
Thomas Connor from the "Chicago Sun-Times" wrote that the new version "just seems to add a few brassy backup singers to the exact same arrangement."
Caryn Ganz from "Rolling Stone" agreed, writing that it was "hard to figure out what's 'extra festive'" about the new version.
Dan Hancox, editor of "The National", also felt the new version was unnecessary.In 2011, pop singer Justin Bieber also recorded a version of the song as a duet with Carey, titled "All I Want for Christmas Is You (Superfestive!
)", on his holiday album, "Under the Mistletoe".
The accompanying music video for the duet was filmed in Macy's department store in New York, and features Bieber shopping with his friends whilst Carey poses on a staging area next to a Christmas tree and gifts.
The two rejoice at the end by sitting in a sleigh with a crowd of young customers handing out gifts to everyone.
was the first season of prison break in hollywood?
The first three seasons of "Prison Break" were primarily filmed outside of Hollywood.
The majority of the first season of the series was filmed on location in and around Chicago.
After it was closed down in 2002, Joliet Prison became the set of "Prison Break" in 2005, standing in as Fox River State Penitentiary on screen.
Scenes set in Lincoln's cell, the infirmary, and the prison yard were all shot on location at the prison.
Lincoln's cell was alleged to be the same one in which serial killer John Wayne Gacy was incarcerated, which at least one member of the production crew refused to enter, because it was alleged to be haunted.
Other sets were built at the prison, including the cell blocks that housed the general prison population; these blocks had three tiers of cells (as opposed to the real cell block's two) and had cells much larger than real cells to allow more space for the actors and cameras.
Exterior scenes were filmed in areas around Chicago, Woodstock, and Joliet in Illinois.
Other locations included O'Hare International Airport in Chicago and Toronto, Ontario in Canada.
"Prison Break" spent $2 million per episode in the state of Illinois, which cost them a total of $24 million in 2005.Renewed for a second season, "Prison Break" resumed filming on June 15, 2006, in Dallas, Texas due to the close proximity of rural and urban settings.
Locations within a 30-minute radius of Dallas were chosen which included Little Elm, Decatur, and Mineral Wells.
Many of these locations were used to represent various American towns.
The show was expected to spend in excess of $50 million in Texas over the course of the second season.
For the final three episodes of the second season, filming took place in Pensacola, Florida to represent Panama.
Each episode took eight days to film and approximately $1.4 million went to the local economy per episode.The third season was shot in Dallas and had a budget of $3 million per episode.
Several of the exterior scenes with Lincoln and Gretchen negotiating the escape from the Panama jail were shot in the Casco Viejo quarter of Panama City.
The principal photography for the fourth season was relocated to Los Angeles, California.
How much was spent on each episode of the 10th season.
Distribution.Broadcast.After the produced pilot lived up to NBC's hopes, the series premiered with the name "Friends" on September 22, 1994 in the coveted Thursday 8:30 p.m. timeslot.
The pilot aired between "Mad About You" and "Seinfeld", and was watched by almost 22 million American viewers.
The series was a huge success throughout its run, and was a staple of NBC's Thursday night line-up, dubbed by the network as Must See TV.
When Crane told reporters in 2001 that the ninth season was a possibility, critics believed that he was posturing, and that at least two of the cast members would not sign on for another season.
When it was confirmed that "Friends" would return for a ninth season, the news was mainly about the amount of money—$7 million per episode—that it took to bring the series back for another season.After year-long expectations that the ninth season would be the series' last, NBC signed a deal in late December 2002 to bring the series back for a final tenth season.
The series' creative team did not want to extend negotiations into the next year, and wanted to start writing the rest of the ninth season episodes and a potential series finale.
NBC agreed to pay $10 million to Warner Bros. for the production of each tenth season episode, the highest price in television history for a 30-minute series.
Although NBC was unable to bring in enough advertising revenue from commercials to cover the costs, the series was integral to the Thursday night schedule, which brought high ratings and profits to the other television series.
The cast demanded that the tenth season be reduced from the usual 24 episodes to 18 episodes to allow them to work on outside projects.In fall 2001, Warner Bros.
Domestic Cable made a deal with sister network TBS (both are owned by Time Warner) to air the series in rerun syndication.
Warner Bros.
Domestic Cable announced that it had sold additional cable rights to "Friends" to Nick at Nite which began airing in the fall of 2011 (unlike the TBS and broadcast syndication airings, Nick at Nite broadcasts of the series, which began airing as part of a seven-night launch marathon on September 5, 2011, replace the end credit tag scenes with marginalized credits featuring promotions for the series and other Nick at Nite programs).
Warner Bros. was expected to make $200 million in license fees and advertising from the deal.
Nick at Nite paid $500,000 per episode to air the episodes after 6 p.m.
ET for six years through fall 2017.
TBS also renewed its contract for the same six-year period as Nick at Nite but paid $275,000 per episode because airings were restricted to before 6 p.m.
ET except for the first year.
In syndication until 2005, "Friends" had earned $4 million per episode in cash license fees for a total of $944 million.Beginning on March 5, 2012, high definition versions of all 236 "Friends" episodes were made available to local broadcast stations, starting with the pilot episode.
For the remastered episodes, Warner Bros. restored previously cropped images on the left and right sides of the screen, using the original 35 mm film source, to use the entire widescreen frame.
These masters had been airing in New Zealand on TV2 since January 2011.
Lorres alleged the program was plagiarized because of the use of what?
Through the use of his vanity cards at the end of episodes, Lorre alleged that the program had been plagiarized by a show produced and aired in Belarus.
Officially titled Теоретики ("The Theorists"), the show features "clones" of the main characters, a similar opening sequence, and what appears to be a very close Russian translation of the scripts.
Lorre expressed annoyance and described his inquiry with the Warner Brothers legal department about options.
The television production company and station's close relationship with the Belarus government was cited as the reason that any attempt to claim copyright infringement would be in vain because the company copying the episodes is operated by the government.However, no legal action was required to end production of the other show: as soon as the word got out that the show was unlicensed, the actors quit and the producers cancelled it.
Dmitriy Tankovich (who plays Leonard's counterpart, "Seva") said in an interview: "I'm upset.
At first, the actors were told all legal issues were resolved.
We didn't know it wasn't the case, so when the creators of "The Big Bang Theory" started talking about the show, I was embarrassed.
I can't understand why our people first do, and then think.
I consider this to be the rock bottom of my career.
And I don't want to take part in a stolen show".
how old is scott howard?
Seventeen-year-old high school student Scott Howard is sick of being average and wishing he were special.
His father runs a local hardware store.
Scott plays basketball for his high school's team, the Beavers, with a not-so-good win-loss record.
The girl of his dreams, Pamela Wells, is dating Mick McAllister, a jerk from an opposing high school team, the Dragons.
After another of the team's losses, Scott begins to notice strange changes to his body.
While at a party, Scott keeps undergoing changes and eventually he returns home, locks himself in the bathroom, and undergoes a complete change and becomes a werewolf, while his father demands that he open the door.
He tries to refuse, only to finally give in and find his father has also transformed.
Harold never told his son about the condition because "sometimes it skips a generation" and he was hoping it would not happen to Scott.
Scott accidentally reveals his transformation to the public at one of his basketball games.
After momentarily stunning the crowd with The Wolf, Scott goes on to amaze them with his basketball skills.Scott subsequently learns to use his family "curse" to gain popularity at school, becoming the team's star basketball player, and learns to transform at will between his normal self and The Wolf.
His team goes from last to first, and Scott begins spending most of his time at school as The Wolf.
He also wins the interest of Pamela while ignoring the affections of his best friend, Boof, who has loved him since childhood.
One night at a school dance, however, he gets into a confrontation with Mick causing Scott to become The Wolf and claw Mick.
Though Mick isn't seriously injured, the crowd starts looking at Scott as a monster rather than the cool basketball star he had become.
The conclusion of the film finds Scott playing in the championship basketball game as himself against Mick's team.
During the game Mick constantly fouls Scott leading Scott to remind him if he keeps fouling he will be benched.
Mick fouls him one last time leading Scott to shoot two free throws.
He makes both baskets putting the Beavers ahead and wins the game.
While Scott is being carried by the crowd, Pamela walks over to him, but he snubs her and runs over to Boof where they kiss.
Mick goes to get Pamela, who now has lost interest in the former basketball hero.
The last scene shows Scott, Boof, and Mr. Howard embracing as the whole school celebrates.
"Breaking Bad" creator Vince Gilligan cast Bryan Cranston for the role of Walter White based on having worked with him in an episode of what previous television series?
"Breaking Bad" creator Vince Gilligan cast Bryan Cranston for the role of Walter White based on having worked with him in an episode of the science fiction television series "The X-Files", on which Gilligan worked as a writer.
Cranston played an anti-Semite with a terminal illness who took series co-protagonist Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) hostage.
Gilligan said the character had to be simultaneously loathsome and sympathetic, and that "Bryan alone was the only actor who could do that, who could pull off that trick.
And it is a trick.
I have no idea how he does it."
AMC officials, who were initially reluctant with the casting choice, having known Cranston only as the over-the-top character Hal on the comedy series "Malcolm in the Middle", approached actors John Cusack and Matthew Broderick about the role.
When both actors declined, the executives were persuaded to cast Cranston after seeing his "X-Files" episode.Cranston contributed a great deal to the Walter White persona.
When Gilligan left much of Walter's past unexplained during the development of the series, the actor wrote his own backstory for the character.
At the start of the show, Cranston gained 10 pounds to reflect the character's personal decline and had the natural red highlights of his hair dyed a regular brown.
He collaborated with costume designer Kathleen Detoro on a wardrobe of mostly neutral green and brown colors to make the character bland and unremarkable, and worked with makeup artist Frieda Valenzuela to create a mustache he described as "impotent" and like a "dead caterpillar".
Cranston repeatedly identified elements within certain scripts where he disagreed with how the character was handled, and went so far as to call Gilligan directly when he could not work out disagreements with the episode's screenwriters.
Cranston has said he was inspired partially by his elderly father for how Walter carries himself physically, which he described as "a little hunched over, never erect, if the weight of the world is on this man's shoulders".
In contrast to his character, Cranston has been described as extremely playful on set, with Aaron Paul describing him as "a kid trapped in a man's body".Gilligan originally intended for Aaron Paul's character, Jesse Pinkman, to be killed at the end of "Breaking Bad" 's first season in a botched drug deal as a plot device to plague Walter White with guilt.
However, Gilligan said by the second episode of the season, he was so impressed with Paul's performance that "it became pretty clear early on that would be a huge, colossal mistake, to kill off Jesse".

What year was "The Five Doctors" produced?
In 1983, coinciding with the series' 20th anniversary, a charity special titled "The Five Doctors" was produced in aid of Children in Need, featuring three of the first five Doctors, a new actor to replace the deceased William Hartnell, and unused footage to represent Tom Baker.
This was a full-length, 90-minute film, the longest single episode of "Doctor Who" produced to date (the television movie ran slightly longer on broadcast where it included commercial breaks).In 1993, for the franchise's 30th anniversary, another charity special, titled "Dimensions in Time" was produced for Children in Need, featuring all of the surviving actors who played the Doctor and a number of previous companions.
It also featured a crossover with the soap opera "EastEnders", the action taking place in the latter's Albert Square location and around Greenwich.
The special was one of several special 3D programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system that made use of the Pulfrich effect requiring glasses with one darkened lens; the picture would look normal to those viewers who watched without the glasses.In 1999, another special, "Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death", was made for Comic Relief and later released on VHS.
An affectionate parody of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional serial format, complete with cliffhangers, and running down the same corridor several times when being chased (the version released on video was split into only two episodes).
In the story, the Doctor (Rowan Atkinson) encounters both the Master (Jonathan Pryce) and the Daleks.
During the special the Doctor is forced to regenerate several times, with his subsequent incarnations played by, in order, Richard E. Grant, Jim Broadbent, Hugh Grant and Joanna Lumley.
The script was written by Steven Moffat, later to be head writer and executive producer to the revived series.Since the return of "Doctor Who" in 2005, the franchise has produced two original "mini-episodes" to support Children in Need.
The first, aired in November 2005, was an which introduced David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor.
It was followed in November 2007 by "Time Crash", a 7-minute scene which featured the Tenth Doctor meeting the Fifth Doctor (played once again by Peter Davison).A set of two mini-episodes, titled "Space" and "Time" respectively, were produced to support Comic Relief.
They were aired during the Comic Relief 2011 event.During 2011 Children in Need, an exclusively-filmed segment showed the Doctor addressing the viewer, attempting to persuade them to purchase items of his clothing, which were going up for auction for Children in Need.
The 2012 edition of CiN featured the mini-episode "The Great Detective".

Who portrays the character Georgina Sparks?
Featuring nine regular speaking roles, the majority of the ensemble cast was assembled from February to April 2007.
Leighton Meester and Blake Lively - who started auditioning in December 2006 - were the first two actresses to be chosen in February for the lead roles of Blair Waldorf and Serena van der Woodsen, respectively.
Penn Badgley, who had previously worked with Stephanie Savage on "The Mountain", Taylor Momsen, Chace Crawford, Kelly Rutherford and Connor Paolo also auditioned successfully and landed roles in the series in March, as did Florencia Lozano who appeared only in the pilot, and was replaced by Margaret Colin.
Badgley had initially turned down the part of Dan.
Actors for the roles of Chuck Bass and Rufus Humphrey were found in April when English actor Ed Westwick, and Matthew Settle were cast.
Westwick first read for the role of Nate but was then asked to try Chuck.
As rumors swirled about the impending cancellation of "Veronica Mars", it was revealed at The CW's 2007 Upfronts on May 17, 2007 that Kristen Bell had narrated the pilot, thus making her the title character of another show on the network.
Jessica Szohr was signed on to portray the recurring role of Vanessa Abrams and received regular status during the fourteenth episode of the first season.
Kaylee DeFer joined the series in the eighteenth episode of the fourth season and was promoted to series regular for the show's fifth season.At the conclusion of the fourth season, Momsen, who went on an indefinite hiatus during the season while retaining regular billing, and Jessica Szhor both left the show.
Throughout the series' run, Connor Paolo consistently declined to elevate his recurring role of Eric van der Woodsen to regular status, citing personal reasons for his decision.
After becoming a regular on the ABC series "Revenge", Paolo confirmed his departure from "Gossip Girl" in August 2011.As the show progressed, numerous recurring guest stars appeared in the show.
Michelle Trachtenberg signed on to portray Georgina Sparks.
The role had previously been offered to Mischa Barton who passed.
Francie Swift and Sam Robards took the parental roles of Anne and Howard Archibald, respectively.
Caroline Lagerfelt portrayed Celia "CeCe" Rhodes, Serena and Eric's grandmother and Lily's mother.
Sebastian Stan made several appearances as Carter Baizen throughout the show's first three seasons.

What two sitcoms did Seth MacFarlane draw inspiration from for Family Guy?
MacFarlane initially conceived "Family Guy" in 1995 while studying animation at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD).
During college, he created his thesis film entitled "The Life of Larry", which was submitted by his professor at RISD to Hanna-Barbera.
MacFarlane was hired by the company.
In 1996 MacFarlane created a sequel to "The Life of Larry" entitled "Larry and Steve", which featured a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve; the short was broadcast in 1997 as one of Cartoon Network's "World Premiere Toons".Executives at Fox saw the "Larry" shorts and contracted MacFarlane to create a series, entitled "Family Guy", based on the characters.
Fox proposed MacFarlane complete a 15-minute short, and gave him a budget of $50,000.
Several aspects of "Family Guy" were inspired by the "Larry shorts".
While working on the series, the characters of Larry and his dog Steve slowly evolved into Peter and Brian.
MacFarlane stated that the difference between "The Life of Larry" and "Family Guy" was that ""Life of Larry" was shown primarily in my dorm room and "Family Guy" was shown after the Super Bowl."
After the pilot aired, the series was given the green light.
MacFarlane drew inspiration from several sitcoms such as "The Simpsons" and "All in the Family".
Premises were drawn from several 1980s Saturday morning cartoons he watched as a child, such as "The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang" and "Rubik, the Amazing Cube".The Griffin family first appeared on the demo that MacFarlane pitched to Fox on May 15, 1998.
"Family Guy" was originally planned to start out as short movies for the sketch show "MADtv", but the plan changed because MADtv's budget was not large enough to support animation production.
MacFarlane noted that he then wanted to pitch it to Fox, as he thought that that was the place to create a prime-time animation show.
"Family Guy" was originally pitched to Fox in the same year as "King of the Hill", but the show was not bought until years later, when "King of the Hill" became successful.
Fox ordered 13 episodes of "Family Guy" to air in midseason after MacFarlane impressed executives with a seven-minute demo.
Who created South Park?
South Park is an American adult animated sitcom created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone for the Comedy Central television network.
Intended for mature audiences, the show has become famous for its crude language and dark, surreal humor that satirizes a wide range of topics.
The ongoing narrative revolves around four boys—Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick—and their bizarre adventures in and around the titular Colorado town.Parker and Stone developed the show from two animated shorts they created in 1992 and 1995.
The latter became one of the first Internet viral videos, which ultimately led to its production as a series.
"South Park" debuted in August 1997 with great success, consistently earning the highest ratings of any basic cable program.
Subsequent ratings have varied but it remains one of Comedy Central's highest rated shows, and is slated to air through at least 2016.
The pilot episode was produced using cutout animation.
All subsequent episodes are created with software that emulates the cutout technique.
Parker and Stone perform most of the voice acting.
Since 2000, each episode is typically written and produced during the week preceding its broadcast, with Parker serving as the primary writer and director.
There have been a total of episodes over the course of the show's 17 seasons.The series has received numerous accolades, including five Primetime Emmy Awards, a Peabody Award, and numerous inclusions in various publications' lists of greatest television shows.
The show's popularity resulted in a feature-length theatrical film, "" which was released in June 1999, less than two years after the show's premiere, and became a commercial and critical success.
In 2013, "TV Guide" ranked "South Park" the tenth Greatest TV Cartoon of All Time.
Stone Mountain at it's longest point continues into which county?
Stone Mountain is a pluton, a type of igneous intrusion.
Primarily composed of quartz monzonite, the dome of Stone Mountain was formed during the formation of the Blue Ridge Mountains, part of the Appalachian Mountains.
It formed as a result of the upwelling of magma from within the Earth's crust.
This magma solidified to form granite within the crust five to ten miles below the surface.
Stone Mountain pluton continues underground at its longest point into Gwinnett County.
Numerous reference books and Georgia literature have dubbed Stone Mountain as “the largest exposed piece of granite in the world".
This misnomer is most likely a result of advertisement by granite companies and early park administration.
Stone Mountain, though often called a pink granite dome, actually ranges in composition from quartz monzonite to granite and granodiorite.The minerals within the rock include quartz, plagioclase feldspar, microcline and muscovite, with smaller amounts of biotite and tourmaline.
The tourmaline is mostly black in color, and the majority of it exists as optically continuous skeletal crystals, but much larger, euhedral pegmatitic tourmaline crystals can also be found in the mountain's numerous, cross-cutting felsic dikes.Embedded in the granite are xenoliths or pieces of foreign rocks entrained in the magma.The granite intruded into the metamorphic rocks of the Piedmont region during the last stages of the Alleghenian Orogeny, which was the time when North America and North Africa collided.
Over time, erosion eventually exposed the present mountain of more resistant igneous rock.
This intrusion of granite also gave rise to Panola Mountain in DeKalb County, smaller outcroppings further east of Stone Mountain.
What type of building did the Seneca Indian Tribe open in Niagara Falls?
From the U.S. side, the American Falls can be viewed from walkways along Prospect Point Park, which also features the Prospect Point Park observation tower and a boat dock for the "Maid of the Mist".
Goat Island offers more views of the falls and is accessible by foot and automobile traffic by bridge above the American Falls.
From Goat Island, the Cave of the Winds is accessible by elevator and leads hikers to a point beneath Bridal Veil Falls.
Also on Goat Island are the Three Sisters Islands, the Power Portal where a huge statue of Nikola Tesla (the inventor whose patents for the AC induction motor and other devices for AC power transmission helped make the harnessing of the falls possible) can be seen, and a walking path that enables views of the rapids, the Niagara River, the gorge, and all of the falls.
Most of these attractions lie within the Niagara Falls State Park.The Niagara Scenic Trolley offers guided trips along the American Falls and around Goat Island.
Panoramic and aerial views of the falls can also be viewed from the Flight of Angels helium balloon ride, or by helicopter.
The Niagara Gorge Discovery Center showcases the natural and local history of Niagara Falls and the Niagara Gorge.
A casino and luxury hotel was opened in Niagara Falls, New York, by the Seneca Indian tribe.
The Seneca Niagara Casino occupies the former Niagara Falls Convention Center.
The new hotel is the first addition to the city's skyline since completion of the United Office Building in the twenties.
How many years did it take to to construct the Leaning Tower of Pisa?
Construction of the tower occurred in three stages across 199 years.
Work on the ground floor of the white marble campanile began on August 14, 1173, during a period of military success and prosperity.
This ground floor is a blind arcade articulated by engaged columns with classical Corinthian capitals.The tower began to sink after construction had progressed to the second floor in 1178.
This was due to a mere three-metre foundation, set in weak, unstable subsoil, a design that was flawed from the beginning.
Construction was subsequently halted for almost a century, because the Republic of Pisa was almost continually engaged in battles with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence.
This allowed time for the underlying soil to settle.
Otherwise, the tower would almost certainly have toppled.
In 1198 clocks were temporarily installed on the third floor of the unfinished construction.In 1272 construction resumed under Giovanni di Simone, architect of the Camposanto.
In an effort to compensate for the tilt, the engineers built upper floors with one side taller than the other.
Because of this, the tower is actually curved.
Construction was halted again in 1284, when the Pisans were defeated by the Genoans in the Battle of Meloria.The seventh floor was completed in 1319.
It was built by Tommaso di Andrea Pisano, who succeeded in harmonizing the Gothic elements of the bell-chamber with the Romanesque style of the tower.
There are seven bells, one for each note of the musical major scale.
The largest one was installed in 1655.
The bell-chamber was finally added in 1372.After a phase (1990–2001) of structural strengthening, the tower is currently undergoing gradual surface restoration, in order to repair visible damage, mostly corrosion and blackening.
These are particularly pronounced due to the tower's age and its exposure to wind and rain.
when has the eiffel tower first been used for radio transmission
The tower has been used for radio transmission since the beginning of the 20th century.
Until the 1950s, sets of antenna wires ran from the summit to anchors on the Avenue de Suffren and Champ de Mars.
These were connected to long-wave transmitters in small bunkers; in 1909 a permanent underground radio centre was built near the south pillar, which still exists today.
On 20 November 1913 the Paris Observatory, using the Eiffel Tower as an antenna, exchanged sustained wireless signals with the United States Naval Observatory which used an antenna in Arlington, Virginia.
The object of the transmissions was to measure the difference in longitude between Paris and Washington, D.C. Today, both radio and television stations broadcast their signals from the top of the Eiffel Tower.
What section of the city was probably residential?
Site.Layout.The site is roughly divided into an urban sector and an agricultural sector, as well as the upper town and the lower town.
The temples are part of the upper town, the warehouses the lower.The architecture is adapted to the natural form of the mountains.
Approximately 200 buildings are arranged on wide parallel terraces around a vast central square that is oriented east-west.
The various "kanchas" or compounds are long and narrow in order to exploit the terrain.
Extensive terraces were used for agriculture and sophisticated channeling systems provided irrigation for the fields.
Numerous stone stairways set in the walls allowed access to the different levels across the site.
The eastern section of the city was probably residential.
The western, separated by the square, was for religious and ceremonial purposes.
This section contains the Torreón, the massive tower which may have been used as an observatory.Located in the first zone are the primary archaeological treasures: the "Intihuatana", the "Temple of the Sun" and the "Room of the Three Windows".
These were dedicated to "Inti", their sun god and greatest deity.The Popular District, or Residential District, is the place where the lower-class people lived.
It includes storage buildings and simple houses.The royalty area, a sector for the nobility, is a group of houses located in rows over a slope; the residence of the Amautas (wise persons) was characterized by its reddish walls, and the zone of the "Ñustas" (princesses) had trapezoid-shaped rooms.
The Monumental Mausoleum is a carved statue with a vaulted interior and carved drawings.
It was used for rites or sacrifices.The Guardhouse is a three-sided building, with one of its long sides opening onto the Terrace of the Ceremonial Rock.
The three-sided style of Inca architecture is known as the "wayrona" style.
When was Disneyland dedicated at an "International Press Preview"?
Disneyland was dedicated at an "International Press Preview" event held on Sunday, July 17, 1955, which was only open to invited guests and the media.
Although 28,000 people attended the event, only about half of those were actual invitees, the rest having purchased counterfeit tickets.
The following day, it opened to the public, featuring twenty attractions.
The Special Sunday events, including the dedication, were televised nationwide and anchored by three of Walt Disney's friends from Hollywood: Art Linkletter, Bob Cummings, and Ronald Reagan.
ABC broadcast the event live, during which many guests tripped over the television camera cables.
In Frontierland, a camera caught Cummings kissing a dancer.
When Disney started to read the plaque for Tomorrowland, he read partway then stopped when a technician off-camera said something to him, and after realizing he was on-air, said, "I thought I got a signal", and began the dedication from the start.
At one point, while in Fantasyland, Linkletter tried to give coverage to Cummings, who was on the pirateship.
He was not ready, and tried to give the coverage back to Linkletter, who had lost his microphone.
Cummings then did a play-by-play of him trying to find it in front of Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.Traffic was delayed on the two-lane Harbor Boulevard.
Famous figures who were scheduled to show up every two hours showed up all at once.
The temperature was an unusually high , and because of a local plumbers' strike, Disney was given a choice of having working drinking fountains or running toilets.
He chose the latter, leaving many drinking fountains dry.
This generated negative publicity since Pepsi sponsored the park's opening; disappointed guests believed the inoperable fountains were a cynical way to sell soda, while other vendors ran out of food.
The asphalt that had been poured that morning was soft enough to let ladies' high-heeled shoes sink into it.
A gas leak in Fantasyland caused Adventureland, Frontierland, and Fantasyland to close for the afternoon.
Some parents threw their children over the crowd's shoulders to get them onto rides, such as the King Arthur Carrousel.
In later years, Disney and his 1955 executives referred to July 17, 1955 as "Black Sunday".After the extremely negative press from the preview opening, Walt Disney invited attendees back for a private "second day" to experience Disneyland properly.
The next day, crowds gathered in line as early as 2:00 am.
The first person to buy a ticket and enter the park was David MacPherson with ticket number 2, as Roy O. Disney arranged to pre-purchase ticket number 1 from Curtis Lineberry, the manager of admissions.
However, an official picture of Walt Disney and two children, Christine Vess Watkins (age 5) and Michael Schwartner (7), inaccurately identifies them as the first two guests of Disneyland.
Both received lifetime passes to Disneyland that day, and MacPherson was awarded one shortly thereafter, which was later expanded to every single Disney-owned park in the world.
Approximately 50,000 guests attended the Monday opening day.
What is the Great Wall of China made of?
The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China in part to protect the Chinese Empire or its prototypical states against intrusions by various nomadic groups or military incursions by various warlike peoples or forces.
Several walls were being built as early as the 7th century BC; these, later joined together and made bigger and stronger, are now collectively referred to as the Great Wall.
Especially famous is the wall built between 220–206 BC by the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang.
Little of that wall remains.
Since then, the Great Wall has on and off been rebuilt, maintained, and enhanced; the majority of the existing wall are from the Ming Dynasty.Other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and emigration.
Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of watch towers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor.The main Great Wall line stretches from Shanhaiguan in the east, to Lop Lake in the west, along an arc that roughly delineates the southern edge of Inner Mongolia.
A comprehensive archaeological survey, using advanced technologies, has concluded that the Ming walls measure .
This is made up of sections of actual wall, of trenches and of natural defensive barriers such as hills and rivers.
Another archaeological survey found that the entire wall with all of its branches measure out to be .
Where is the Devil's Pool located?
By the end of the 1990s almost 300,000 people were visiting the falls annually, and this was expected to rise to over a million in the next decade.
Unlike the game parks, Victoria Falls has more Zimbabwean and Zambian visitors than international tourists; the attraction is accessible by bus and train, and is therefore comparatively inexpensive to reach.The two countries permit tourists to make day trips from each side and visas can be obtained at the border posts.
Costs vary from US$45-US$80 (as of 01 December 2013).
Visitors with single entry visas will need to purchase a visa each time they cross the border.
Regular changes in visa regulations mean visitors should check the rules before crossing the border.
A famous feature is the naturally formed Devil's Pool, near the edge of the falls on Livingstone Island on the Zambian side.
When the river flow is at a certain level, usually between September and December, a rock barrier forms an eddy with minimal current, allowing adventurous swimmers to splash around in relative safety a few feet from the point where the water cascades over the falls.
Occasional deaths have been reported when people have slipped over the rock barrier.The numbers of visitors to the Zimbabwean side of the falls has historically been much higher than the number visiting the Zambia side, due to the greater development of the visitor facilities there.
However, the number of tourists visiting Zimbabwe began to decline in the early 2000s as political tensions between supporters and opponents of president Robert Mugabe increased.
In 2006, hotel occupancy on the Zimbabwean side hovered at around 30%, while the Zambian side was at near-capacity, with rates in top hotels reaching US$630 per night.
The rapid development has prompted the United Nations to consider revoking the Falls' status as a World Heritage Site.
In addition, problems of waste disposal and a lack of effective management of the falls' environment are a concern.
How many species of trees and other vascular plants are in Yellowstone National Park?
Over 1,700 species of trees and other vascular plants are native to the park.
Another 170 species are considered to be exotic species and are non-native.
Of the eight conifer tree species documented, Lodgepole Pine forests cover 80% of the total forested areas.
Other conifers, such as Subalpine Fir, Engelmann Spruce, Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and Whitebark Pine, are found in scattered groves throughout the park.
As of 2007, the whitebark pine is threatened by a fungus known as white pine blister rust; however, this is mostly confined to forests well to the north and west.
In Yellowstone, about seven percent of the whitebark pine species have been impacted with the fungus, compared to nearly complete infestations in northwestern Montana.
Quaking Aspen and willows are the most common species of deciduous trees.
The aspen forests have declined significantly since the early 20th century, but scientists at Oregon State University attribute recent recovery of the aspen to the reintroduction of wolves which has changed the grazing habits of local elk.There are dozens of species of flowering plants that have been identified, most of which bloom between the months of May and September.
The Yellowstone Sand Verbena is a rare flowering plant found only in Yellowstone.
It is closely related to species usually found in much warmer climates, making the sand verbena an enigma.
The estimated 8,000 examples of this rare flowering plant all make their home in the sandy soils on the shores of Yellowstone Lake, well above the waterline.In Yellowstone's hot waters, bacteria form mats of bizarre shapes consisting of trillions of individuals.
These bacteria are some of the most primitive life forms on earth.
Flies and other arthropods live on the mats, even in the middle of the bitterly cold winters.
Initially, scientists thought that microbes there gained sustenance only from sulfur.
In 2005 researchers from the University of Colorado at Boulder discovered that the sustenance for at least some of the diverse hyperthermophilic species is molecular hydrogen.
"Thermus aquaticus" is a bacterium found in the Yellowstone hot springs that produces an important enzyme (Taq polymerase) that is easily replicated in the lab and is useful in replicating DNA as part of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process.
The retrieval of these bacteria can be achieved with no impact to the ecosystem.
Other bacteria in the Yellowstone hot springs may also prove useful to scientists who are searching for cures for various diseases.Non-native plants sometimes threaten native species by using up nutrient resources.
Though exotic species are most commonly found in areas with the greatest human visitation, such as near roads and at major tourist areas, they have also spread into the backcountry.
Generally, most exotic species are controlled by pulling the plants out of the soil or by spraying, both of which are time consuming and expensive.
when was the national park service formed?
The National Park Service was formed in 1916, and Yosemite was transferred to that agency's jurisdiction.
Tuolumne Meadows Lodge, Tioga Pass Road, and campgrounds at Tenaya and Merced lakes were also completed in 1916.
Automobiles started to enter the park in ever-increasing numbers following the construction of all-weather highways to the park.
The Yosemite Museum was founded in 1926 through the efforts of Ansel Franklin Hall.In 1903, a dam in the northern portion of the park was proposed.
Located in the Hetch Hetchy Valley, its purpose was to provide water and hydroelectric power to San Francisco.
Muir and the Sierra Club opposed the project, while others, including Gifford Pinchot, supported it.
In 1913, the U.S. Congress authorized the O'Shaughnessy Dam through passage of the Raker Act.In the late 1920s, in an attempt that would be impossible to make today, a bid for Yosemite for the 1932 Winter Olympics was put forward.
(Ultimately, Lake Placid, New York, hosted.
)More recently, preservationists persuaded Congress to designate , or about 89% of the park, as the Yosemite Wilderness—a highly protected wilderness area.
The Park Service has reduced artificial inducements to visit the park, such as the "Firefall", in which red-hot embers were pushed off a cliff near Glacier Point at night.
Traffic congestion in Yosemite Valley during the summer months has become a concern.
Two electric buses commenced service in September 1995.
The buses are quiet and do not emit pollutants.
Eventually, all the buses in Yosemite will be electric.
The 1996 Yosemite Valley Landslide killed a hiker and the January 1997 Merced River flood damaged many roads and several campgrounds.
How long is the Grand Canyon Ultra Marathon?
Aside from casual sightseeing from the South Rim (averaging 7,000 feet [2,100 m] above sea level), rafting, hiking, running and helicopter tours are especially popular.
The Grand Canyon Ultra Marathon is a race over 24 hours.
The floor of the valley is accessible by foot, muleback, or by boat or raft from upriver.
Hiking down to the river and back up to the rim in one day is discouraged by park officials because of the distance, steep and rocky trails, change in elevation, and danger of heat exhaustion from the much higher temperatures at the bottom.
Rescues are required annually of unsuccessful rim-to-river-to-rim travelers.
Nevertheless, hundreds of fit and experienced hikers complete the trip every year.Camping on the North and South Rims is generally restricted to established campgrounds and reservations are highly recommended, especially at the busier South Rim.
There is at large camping available along many parts of the North Rim managed by Kaibab National Forest.
North Rim campsites are only open seasonally due to road closures from weather and winter snowpack.
All overnight camping below the rim requires a backcountry permit from the Backcountry Office (BCO).
Each year Grand Canyon National Park receives approximately 30,000 requests for backcountry permits.
The park issues 13,000 permits, and close to 40,000 people camp overnight.
The earliest a permit application is accepted is the first of the month, four months before the proposed start month.Tourists wishing for a more vertical perspective can board helicopters and small airplanes in Las Vegas, Phoenix and Grand Canyon National Park Airport (seven miles from the South Rim) for canyon flyovers.
Scenic flights are no longer allowed to fly within 1500 feet of the rim within the national park because of a late 1990s crash.
The last aerial video footage from below the rim was filmed in 1984.
However, some helicopter flights land on the Havasupai and Hualapai Indian Reservations within Grand Canyon (outside of the park boundaries).
Recently, the Hualapai Tribe opened the glass-bottomed Grand Canyon Skywalk on their property, Grand Canyon West.
The Skywalk has seen mixed reviews since the site is only accessible by driving down a dirt road, costs a minimum of $85 in total for reservation fees, a tour package and admission to the Skywalk itself and the fact that cameras or other personal equipment are not permitted on the Skywalk at any time due to the hazard of damaging the glass if dropped.
The Skywalk is about by road from Grand Canyon Village at the South Rim.
What are the two streams in the Mount Rushmore Memorial?
The flora and fauna of Mount Rushmore are similar to those of the rest of the Black Hills region of South Dakota.
Birds including the turkey vulture, bald eagle, hawk, and meadowlark fly around Mount Rushmore, occasionally making nesting spots in the ledges of the mountain.
Smaller birds, including songbirds, nuthatches, and woodpeckers, inhabit the surrounding pine forests.
Terrestrial mammals include the mouse, least chipmunk, red squirrel, skunk, porcupine, raccoon, beaver, badger, coyote, bighorn sheep, bobcat, elk, mule deer, yellow-bellied marmot, and American bison.
The striped chorus frog, western chorus frog, and northern leopard frog also inhabit the area.
In addition, several species of snakes inhabit the region.
Grizzly Bear Brook and Starling Basin Brook, the two streams in the memorial, support fish such as the longnose dace and the brook trout.
Mountain goats are not indigenous to the area but can also be found here.
They are descended from goats which were a gift from Canada to Custer State Park in 1924 but later escaped.At lower elevations, coniferous trees, mainly the Ponderosa pine, surround most of the monument, providing shade from the sun.
Other trees include the bur oak, the Black Hills spruce, and the cottonwood.
Nine species of shrubs grow near Mount Rushmore.
There is also a wide variety of wildflowers, including especially the snapdragon, sunflower, and violet.
Towards higher elevations, plant life becomes sparser.
However, only approximately five percent of the plant species found in the Black Hills are indigenous to the region.The area receives about of precipitation on average per year, enough to support abundant animal and plant life.
Trees and other plants help to control surface runoff.
Dikes, seeps, and springs help to dam up water that is flowing downhill, providing watering spots for animals.
In addition, stones like sandstone and limestone help to hold groundwater, creating aquifers.Through the study of tree rings, it has been determined that forest fires have occurred in the Ponderosa forests surrounding Mount Rushmore around every 27 years based on evidence of fire scars found within tree core samples.
Large conflagrations are not common.
Most events have been ground fires that serve to clear forest debris.
The area is a climax community.
Recent pine beetle infestations have threatened the forest.
When did the NPS gained jurisdiction over the rest of Bedloe's Island?
Early National Park Service years (1933–1982).In 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt ordered the statue transferred to the National Park Service (NPS).
In 1937, the NPS gained jurisdiction over the rest of Bedloe's Island.
With the Army's departure, the NPS began to transform the island into a park.
The Works Progress Administration (WPA) demolished most of the old buildings, regraded and reseeded the eastern end of the island, and built granite steps for a new public entrance to the statue from its rear.
The WPA also carried out restoration work within the statue, temporarily removing the rays from the statue's halo so their rusted supports could be replaced.
Rusted cast-iron steps in the pedestal were replaced with new ones made of reinforced concrete; the upper parts of the stairways within the statue were replaced, as well.
Copper sheathing was installed to prevent further damage from rainwater that had been seeping into the pedestal.
The statue was closed to the public from May until December 1938.During World War II, the statue remained open to visitors, although it was not illuminated at night due to wartime blackouts.
It was lit briefly on December 31, 1943, and on D-Day, June 6, 1944, when its lights flashed "dot-dot-dot-dash", the Morse code for V, for victory.
New, powerful lighting was installed in 1944–1945, and beginning on V-E Day, the statue was once again illuminated after sunset.
The lighting was for only a few hours each evening, and it was not until 1957 that the statue was illuminated every night, all night.
In 1946, the interior of the statue within reach of visitors was coated with a special plastic so that graffiti could be washed away.In 1956, an Act of Congress officially renamed Bedloe's Island as Liberty Island, a change advocated by Bartholdi generations earlier.
The act also mentioned the efforts to found an American Museum of Immigration on the island, which backers took as federal approval of the project, though the government was slow to grant funds for it.
Nearby Ellis Island was made part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument by proclamation of President Lyndon Johnson in 1965.
In 1972, the immigration museum, in the statue's base, was finally opened in a ceremony led by President Richard Nixon.
The museum's backers never provided it with an endowment to secure its future and it closed in 1991 after the opening of an immigration museum on Ellis Island.Beginning December 26, 1971, 15 anti-Vietnam war veterans occupied the statue, flying a US flag upside down from her crown.
They left December 28 following a Federal Court order.
The statue was also several times taken over briefly by demonstrators publicizing causes such as Puerto Rican independence, opposition to abortion, and opposition to US intervention in Grenada.
Demonstrations with the permission of the Park Service included a Gay Pride Parade rally and the annual Captive Baltic Nations rally.A powerful new lighting system was installed in advance of the American Bicentennial in 1976.
The statue was the focal point for Operation Sail, a regatta of tall ships from all over the world that entered New York Harbor on July 4, 1976, and sailed around Liberty Island.
The day concluded with a spectacular display of fireworks near the statue.
When did the first SeaWorld open?
Locations.SeaWorld San Diego.SeaWorld San Diego, the first SeaWorld park, opened on March 21, 1964.
The park features shows such as "One Ocean", the current Shamu show and "Sea Lions Live", a comedic show with sea lions and otters.
Rides include Journey to Atlantis, a splashdown ride that also has characteristics of a roller coaster.
The Summer Nights program changes some shows and adds others.
One show featuring Shamu is available during the night called "Shamu Rocks", a rock concert choreographed to the killer whales, and then the fireworks show "Into the Blue", which uses music from the newest dolphin show "Blue Horizons".

In what year were the stones at Stonehenge roped off?
When Stonehenge was first opened to the public it was possible to walk among and even climb on the stones, but the stones were roped off in 1977 as a result of serious erosion.
Visitors are no longer permitted to touch the stones, but are able to walk around the monument from a short distance away.
English Heritage does, however, permit access during the summer and winter solstice, and the spring and autumn equinox.
Additionally, visitors can make special bookings to access the stones throughout the year.The access situation and the proximity of the two roads has drawn widespread criticism, highlighted by a 2006 National Geographic survey.
In the survey of conditions at 94 leading World Heritage Sites, 400 conservation and tourism experts ranked Stonehenge 75th in the list of destinations, declaring it to be "in moderate trouble".As motorised traffic increased, the setting of the monument began to be affected by the proximity of the two roads on either side – the A344 to Shrewton on the north side, and the A303 to Winterbourne Stoke to the south.
Plans to upgrade the A303 and close the A344 to restore the vista from the stones have been considered since the monument became a World Heritage Site.
However, the controversy surrounding expensive re-routing of the roads has led to the scheme being cancelled on multiple occasions.
On 6 December 2007, it was announced that extensive plans to build Stonehenge road tunnel under the landscape and create a permanent visitors' centre had been cancelled.On 13 May 2009, the government gave approval for a £25 million scheme to create a smaller visitors' centre and close the A344, although this was dependent on funding and local authority planning consent.
On 20 January 2010 Wiltshire Council granted planning permission for a centre to the west and English Heritage confirmed that funds to build it would be available, supported by a £10m grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
On 23 June 2013 the A344 was closed to begin the work of removing the section of road and grassing it over.
The centre, designed by Denton Corker Marshall, opened to the public on 18 December 2013.
What are the measurements of the Colosseum?
The arena itself was 83 meters by 48 meters (272 ft by 157 ft / 280 by 163 Roman feet).
It comprised a wooden floor covered by sand (the Latin word for sand is "harena" or "arena"), covering an elaborate underground structure called the "hypogeum" (literally meaning "underground").
Little now remains of the original arena floor, but the "hypogeum" is still clearly visible.
It consisted of a two-level subterranean network of tunnels and cages beneath the arena where gladiators and animals were held before contests began.
Eighty vertical shafts provided instant access to the arena for caged animals and scenery pieces concealed underneath; larger hinged platforms, called "hegmata", provided access for elephants and the like.
It was restructured on numerous occasions; at least twelve different phases of construction can be seen.The "hypogeum" was connected by underground tunnels to a number of points outside the Colosseum.
Animals and performers were brought through the tunnel from nearby stables, with the gladiators' barracks at the Ludus Magnus to the east also being connected by tunnels.
Separate tunnels were provided for the Emperor and the Vestal Virgins to permit them to enter and exit the Colosseum without needing to pass through the crowds.Substantial quantities of machinery also existed in the "hypogeum".
Elevators and pulleys raised and lowered scenery and props, as well as lifting caged animals to the surface for release.
There is evidence for the existence of major hydraulic mechanisms and according to ancient accounts, it was possible to flood the arena rapidly, presumably via a connection to a nearby aqueduct.
How is the title spelled in modern Italian?
The title of the painting that is known in English as Mona Lisa stems from a description by Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari, who wrote ""Leonardo undertook to paint, for Francesco del Giocondo, the portrait of Mona Lisa, his wife"."
"Mona" in Italian is a polite form of address originating as "ma donna" —similar to "Ma’am", "Madam", or "my lady" in English.This became "madonna", and its contraction "mona".
The title of the painting, though traditionally spelled "Mona" (as used by Vasari), is also commonly spelled in modern Italian as "Monna Lisa", but this is rare in English.Vasari's account of the "Mona Lisa" comes from his biography of Leonardo published in 1550, 31 years after the artist's death, and which has long been the best known source of information on the provenance of the work and identity of the sitter.
Leonardo's assistant Salaì, at his death in 1525, owned a portrait which in his personal papers was named "la Gioconda", a painting bequeathed to him by Leonardo.
That Leonardo painted such a work, and its date, were confirmed in 2005 when a scholar at Heidelberg University discovered a marginal note in a 1477 printing of a volume written by the ancient Roman philosopher Cicero.
The note is dated October 1503 and was written by Leonardo's contemporary Agostino Vespucci.
This note likens Leonardo to renowned Greek painter Apelles, who is mentioned in the text, and states that Leonardo was at that time working on a painting of Lisa del Giocondo.The sitter, Lisa del Giocondo,was a member of the Gherardini family of Florence and Tuscany, and the wife of wealthy Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo.The painting is thought to have been commissioned for their new home, and to celebrate the birth of their second son, Andrea.
The Italian name for the painting, "La Gioconda", means "jocund" ("happy" or "jovial"), or literally "the jocund one", a pun on the feminine form of the sitter's married name "Giocondo".
In French, the title "La Joconde" has the same meaning.Over the years there have been several alternative views among scholars as to the subject of the painting.
Some have argued that Lisa del Giocondo was the subject of a different portrait, identifying at least four other paintings as the "Mona Lisa" referred to by Vasari.Several other individuals have been proposed as the subject of the painting.Isabella of Aragon, Cecilia Gallerani, Costanza d'Avalos, Duchess of Francavilla, Isabella d'Este, Pacifica Brandano or Brandino, Isabela Gualanda, Caterina Sforza, —even Salaì and Leonardo himself— are all among the list of posited models portrayed in the painting.Currently, the consensus of art historians is that the painting depicts Lisa del Giocondo, which has always been the traditional view.
what else was the flowering orchards called?
The series of "Flowering Orchards", sometimes referred to as the "Orchards in Blossom" paintings, were among the first groups of work that Van Gogh completed after his arrival in Arles, Provence in February 1888.
The 14 paintings in this group are optimistic, joyous and visually expressive of the burgeoning Springtime.
They are delicately sensitive, silent, quiet and unpopulated.
About "The Cherry Tree" Vincent wrote to Theo on 21 April 1888 and said he had 10 orchards and: "one big (painting) of a cherry tree, which I've spoiled".
The following spring he painted another smaller group of orchards, including "View of Arles, Flowering Orchards".Van Gogh was taken by the landscape and vegetation of the South of France, and often visited the farm gardens near Arles.
Because of the vivid light supplied by the Mediterranean climate his palette significantly brightened.
From his arrival, he was interested in capturing the effect of the seasons on the surrounding landscape and plant life.
According to Dobrev, whose image is the Sphinx based off of?
Rainer Stadelmann, former director of the German Archaeological Institute in Cairo, examined the distinct iconography of the "nemes" (headdress) and the now-detached beard of the Sphinx and concluded that the style is more indicative of the Pharaoh Khufu (2589–2566 BC), builder of the Great Pyramid of Giza and Khafra's father.
He supports this by suggesting that Khafra's Causeway was built to conform to a pre-existing structure, which, he concludes, given its location, could only have been the Sphinx.Colin Reader, an English geologist who independently conducted a more recent survey of the enclosure, agrees that the various quarries on the site have been excavated around the Causeway.
Because these quarries are known to have been used by Khufu, Reader concludes that the Causeway (and the temples on either end thereof) must predate Khufu, thereby casting doubt on the conventional Egyptian chronology.In 2004, Vassil Dobrev of the Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale in Cairo announced that he had uncovered new evidence that the Great Sphinx may have been the work of the little-known Pharaoh Djedefre (2528–2520 BC), Khafra's half brother and a son of Khufu.
Dobrev suggests that Djedefre built the Sphinx in the image of his father Khufu, identifying him with the sun god Ra in order to restore respect for their dynasty.
Dobrev also notes, like Stadelmann and others, that the causeway connecting Khafre's pyramid to the temples was built around the Sphinx suggesting it was already in existence at the time.
Name a written source that is suggested to have inspired van Gogh in this work?
Perhaps no other painting in Western Art has enjoyed such a varying array of intriguing interpretations.
Academic theories tend towards two schools: "the literal" and "the literary."
The "literal" includes both "he painted what he saw" and the "hallucinatory genius" arguments (as an individual's hallucinations are indistinguishable from real life) while the "literary" suggest that inspiration blossomed from some written source; most often cited for van Gogh's "Starry Night" are The Bible, Walt Whitman and Victor Hugo.Legendary 20th century art historian Albert Boime is generally credited with the best "literal" theory by proving, in conjunction with three Astronomer colleagues at UCLA the position of the stars from van Gogh's window in the asylum at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence at 4 a.m. on June 19, 1889, the day van Gogh wrote his brother that he had completed the painting.
In a 1985 lecture to the American Astronomical Society, Boime compared the positions of the moon and Venus that night and showed that they corresponded to the positions of the celestial objects in the painting.
While Boime and his lead astronomer, Charles Whitney agreed the large star above the horizon is the Morning Star, they failed to agree on the arrangement of the other stars.
Boime claimed they constituted the constellation of Aries, while Whitney argued it was Cygnus.
Boime further attempted to make the argument that van Gogh had likely seen an image of a spiral galaxy from Camille Flammarion's "Astronomie populaire", in an attempt to explain the existence of van Gogh's celestial spiral jetty.
In his 800-plus existing letters, however, van Gogh makes no mention of ever reading Flammarion.As to the leading "literary" theories: those about The Bible range from van Gogh painting a passage out of Genesis 37 describing a dream of Joseph to an apocalyptic depiction out of the twelfth book of Revelation to a "sublimated Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane"; while those from Whitman attempt to correlate the painting's poetic vision within Song of Myself; and (what has been mistakenly attributed to Hugo's Les Miserables) as an inspired depiction of God as "a lighthouse in eclipse.
"This bevy of interpretations has helped keep van Gogh's "Starry Night" firmly within the discussions and lively debates of both public and academic art history.
Who left a note stating "Thanks for the poor security"?
"The Scream" has been the target of a number of thefts and theft attempts.
Some damage has been suffered in these thefts.
On 12 February 1994, the same day as the opening of the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, two men broke into the National Gallery, Oslo, and stole its version of "The Scream", leaving a note reading "Thanks for the poor security".
The painting had been moved down to a second-story gallery as part of the Olympic festivities.
After the gallery refused to pay a ransom demand of US$1 million in March 1994, Norwegian police set up a sting operation with assistance from the British police (SO10) and the Getty Museum and the painting was recovered undamaged on 7 May 1994.
In January 1996, four men were convicted in connection with the theft, including Pål Enger, who had been convicted of stealing Munch's "Vampire" in 1988.
They were released on appeal on legal grounds: the British agents involved in the sting operation had entered Norway under false identities.The 1910 tempera on board version of "The Scream" was stolen on 22 August 2004, during daylight hours, when masked gunmen entered the Munch Museum in Oslo and stole it and Munch's "Madonna".
A bystander photographed the robbers as they escaped to their car with the artwork.
On 8 April 2005, Norwegian police arrested a suspect in connection with the theft, but the paintings remained missing and it was rumored that they had been burned by the thieves to destroy evidence.
On 1 June 2005, with four suspects already in custody in connection with the crime, the city government of Oslo offered a reward of 2 million Norwegian krone (roughly US$313,500 or €231,200) for information that could help locate the paintings.
Although the paintings remained missing, six men went on trial in early 2006, variously charged with either helping to plan or participating in the robbery.
Three of the men were convicted and sentenced to between four and eight years in prison in May 2006, and two of the convicted, Bjørn Hoen and Petter Tharaldsen, were also ordered to pay compensation of 750 million kroner (roughly US$117.6 million or €86.7 million) to the City of Oslo.
The Munch Museum was closed for ten months for a security overhaul.On 31 August 2006, Norwegian police announced that a police operation had recovered both "The Scream" and "Madonna", but did not reveal detailed circumstances of the recovery.
The paintings were said to be in a better-than-expected condition.
"We are 100 percent certain they are the originals," police chief Iver Stensrud told a news conference.
"The damage was much less than feared."
Munch Museum director Ingebjørg Ydstie confirmed the condition of the paintings, saying it was much better than expected and that the damage could be repaired.
"The Scream" had moisture damage on the lower left corner, while "Madonna" suffered several tears on the right side of the painting as well as two holes in Madonna's arm.
Before repairs and restoration began, the paintings were put on public display by the Munch Museum beginning 27 September 2006.
During the five-day exhibition, 5,500 people viewed the damaged paintings.
The conserved works went back on display on 23 May 2008, when the exhibition "Scream and Madonna — Revisited" at the Munch Museum in Oslo displayed the paintings together.
Some damage to "The Scream" may prove impossible to repair, but the overall integrity of the work has not been compromised.
what religion is the last supper associated with?
The Last Supper has been a popular subject in Christian art.
Depictions of the Last Supper in Christian art date back to early Christianity and can be seen in the Catacombs of Rome.
Byzantine artists frequently focused on the Apostles receiving Communion, rather than the reclining figures having a meal.
By the Renaissance, the Last Supper was a favorite topic in Italian art.There are three major themes in the depictions of the last supper.
The first theme is the dramatic and dynamic depiction of Jesus' announcement of his betrayal.
The second theme is the moment of the institution of the tradition of the Eucharist.
The depictions here are generally solemn and mystical.
The third major theme is the farewell of Jesus to his disciples, in which Judas Iscariot is no longer present, having left the supper.
The depictions here are generally melancholy, as Jesus prepares his disciples for his departure.
There are also other, less frequently depicted scenes, such as the washing of the feet of the disciples.Well known examples include Leonardo da Vinci's depiction, which is considered the first work of High Renaissance art due to its high level of harmony, Tintoretto's depiction which is unusual in that it includes secondary characters carrying or taking the dishes from the table and Salvadore Dali's depiction combines the typical Christian themes with modern approaches of Surrealism.
When were Picassos best works made?
"Dora Maar au Chat" presents the artist's most mysterious and challenging mistress regally posed three-quarter length in a large wooden chair with a small black cat perched behind her in both an amusing and menacing attitude.
The faceted planes of her body and richly layered surface of brushstrokes impart a monumental and sculptural quality to this portrait.
The painting is also remarkable for its brilliance of colour and the complex and dense patterning of the model's dress.
The powerful figure is set in a dramatic, yet simple setting composed of a vertiginously inclined plane of wooden floorboards and shallow interior space that is arranged in a manner reminiscent of Picasso’s earliest manipulations of space in a cubist manner.
"Dora Maar au Chat" is one of Picasso’s most valued depictions of his lover and artistic companion.
Their partnership had been one of intellectual exchange and intense passion—Dora was an artist, spoke Picasso’s native Spanish, and shared his political concerns.
She even assisted with the execution of the monumental "Guernica" and produced the only photo-documentary of the work in progress.
She was an intellectual force – a characteristic that both stimulated and challenged Picasso and her influence on him resulted in some of his most powerful and daring portraits of his 75-year career.
Among the best of them are the oils completed during the late 1930s and early 1940s, when Picasso’s art resonated with the drama and emotional upheaval of the era and which Dora came to personify.
The luminous "Dora Maar au Chat" was painted in 1941, at the beginning of the Second World War in France .Maar was one of the most influential figures in Picasso’s life during their relationship and she also became his primary model.
By the time he painted the present picture he had incorporated Dora Maar’s image into countless versions of this motif.
During the occupation of Paris by the Nazis, and as tension mounted in their relationship, the artist would express his frustration by furiously abstracting her image, often portraying her in tears.
While the present portrait might seem a departure from Picasso's more hostile depictions of this model, it may be one of his most brilliant and biting provocations of his "Weeping Woman".
Picasso once likened Maar’s allure and temperament to that of an “Afghan cat”, and the cat in this picture is laden with significance.
In the history of art, the pairing of cats and women was an allusion to feminine wiles and sexual aggression, as exemplified in Manet’s notorious "Olympia".
It is also interesting to consider that the artist has paid particular attention to the sharp, talon-like nails on the long fingers of his model.
In life Maar’s well-manicured hands were one of her most beautiful and distinctive features, and here they have taken on another, more violent characteristic.In addition to being a rare, three-quarter length portrait of Dora Maar, the present work is also a generous and painterly composition with an extraordinary attention to detail.
The artist used an extraordinarily vibrant palette in his rendering of the angles of the chair and the patterning of Maar’s dress.
The most embellished and symbolic element of the sitter’s wardrobe in this picture is her hat, Maar’s most famous accessory and signifier of her involvement in the Surrealist movement.
Ceremoniously placed atop her head like a crown, it is festooned with colourful plumes and outlined with a band of vibrant red.
Larger than life, an impression enhanced by her vibrant body that cannot be confined by the boundaries of the chair, Maar looms in this picture like a pagan goddess seated on her throne.
how many artworks has he made
Picasso was exceptionally prolific throughout his long lifetime.
The total number of artworks he produced has been estimated at 50,000, comprising 1,885 paintings; 1,228 sculptures; 2,880 ceramics, roughly 12,000 drawings, many thousands of prints, and numerous tapestries and rugs.
The medium in which Picasso made his most important contribution was painting.
In his paintings, Picasso used color as an expressive element, but relied on drawing rather than subtleties of color to create form and space.
He sometimes added sand to his paint to vary its texture.
A nanoprobe of Picasso's "The Red Armchair" (1931) by physicists at Argonne National Laboratory in 2012 confirmed art historians' belief that Picasso used common house paint in many of his paintings.
Much of his painting was done at night by artificial light.
Picasso's early sculptures were carved from wood or modeled in wax or clay, but from 1909 to 1928 Picasso abandoned modeling and instead made sculptural constructions using diverse materials.
An example is "Guitar" (1912), a relief construction made of sheet metal and wire that Jane Fluegel terms a "three-dimensional planar counterpart of Cubist painting" that marks a "revolutionary departure from the traditional approaches, modeling and carving".From the beginning of his career, Picasso displayed an interest in subject matter of every kind, and demonstrated a great stylistic versatility that enabled him to work in several styles at once.
For example, his paintings of 1917 included the pointillist "Woman with a Mantilla", the Cubist "Figure in an Armchair", and the naturalistic "Harlequin" (all in the Museu Picasso, Barcelona).
In 1919, he made a number of drawings from postcards and photographs that reflect his interest in the stylistic conventions and static character of posed photographs.
In 1921 he simultaneously painted several large neoclassical paintings and two versions of the Cubist composition "Three Musicians" (Museum of Modern Art, New York; Philadelphia Museum of Art).
In an interview published in 1923, Picasso said, "The several manners I have used in my art must not be considered as an evolution, or as steps towards an unknown ideal of painting … If the subjects I have wanted to express have suggested different ways of expression I have never hesitated to adopt them.
"Although his Cubist works approach abstraction, Picasso never relinquished the objects of the real world as subject matter.
Prominent in his Cubist paintings are forms easily recognized as guitars, violins, and bottles.
When Picasso depicted complex narrative scenes it was usually in prints, drawings, and small-scale works; "Guernica" (1937) is one of his few large narrative paintings.Picasso painted mostly from imagination or memory.
According to William Rubin, Picasso "could only make great art from subjects that truly involved him ….
Unlike Matisse, Picasso had eschewed models virtually all his mature life, preferring to paint individuals whose lives had both impinged on, and had real significance for, his own."
The art critic Arthur Danto said Picasso's work constitutes a "vast pictorial autobiography" that provides some basis for the popular conception that "Picasso invented a new style each time he fell in love with a new woman".
The autobiographical nature of Picasso's art is reinforced by his habit of dating his works, often to the day.
He explained: "I want to leave to posterity a documentation that will be as complete as possible.
That's why I put a date on everything I do."
When did Michelangelo return to Florence?
Michelangelo returned to Florence in 1499.
The republic was changing after the fall of anti-Renaissance Priest and leader of Florence, Girolamo Savonarola, (executed in 1498) and the rise of the "gonfaloniere" Piero Soderini.
He was asked by the consuls of the Guild of Wool to complete an unfinished project begun 40 years earlier by Agostino di Duccio: a colossal statue of Carrara marble portraying David as a symbol of Florentine freedom, to be placed on the gable of Florence Cathedral.
Michelangelo responded by completing his most famous work, the Statue of David, in 1504.
The masterwork definitively established his prominence as a sculptor of extraordinary technical skill and strength of symbolic imagination.
A team of consultants, including Botticelli and Leonardo da Vinci, was called together to decide upon its placement, ultimately the Piazza della Signoria, in front of the Palazzo Vecchio.
It now stands in the Academia while a replica occupies its place in the square.With the completion of the David came another commission.
In early 1504 Leonardo da Vinci had been commissioned in the council chamber of the Palazzo Vecchio depicting the "Battle of Angiari" between the forces of Florence and Milan in 1434.
Michelangelo was then commissioned to paint the "Battle of Cascina".
The two paintings are very different, Leonardo's depicting soldiers fighting on horseback, and Michelangelo's showing soldiers being ambushed as they bathe in the river.
Neither work was completed and both were lost when the chamber was refurbished.
Both works were much admired and copies remain of them, Leonardo's work having been copied by Rubens and Michelangelo's by Bastiano da Sangallo.Also during this period, Michelangelo was commissioned by Angelo Doni to paint a "Holy Family" as a present for his wife, Maddalena Strozzi.
It is known as the "Doni Tondo" and hangs in the Uffizi Gallery in its original magnificent frame which Michelangelo may have designed.
He also may have painted the Madonna and Child with John the Baptist, known as the "Manchester Madonna" and now in the National Gallery, London, United Kingdom.
In what century was the Mona Lisa created?
Among the works created by Leonardo in the 16th century is the small portrait known as the "Mona Lisa" or "la Gioconda", the laughing one.
In the present era it is arguably the most famous painting in the world.
Its fame rests, in particular, on the elusive smile on the woman's face, its mysterious quality brought about perhaps by the fact that the artist has subtly shadowed the corners of the mouth and eyes so that the exact nature of the smile cannot be determined.
The shadowy quality for which the work is renowned came to be called "sfumato" or Leonardo's smoke.
Vasari, who is generally thought to have known the painting only by repute, said that "the smile was so pleasing that it seemed divine rather than human; and those who saw it were amazed to find that it was as alive as the original".Other characteristics found in this work are the unadorned dress, in which the eyes and hands have no competition from other details, the dramatic landscape background in which the world seems to be in a state of flux, the subdued colouring and the extremely smooth nature of the painterly technique, employing oils, but laid on much like tempera and blended on the surface so that the brushstrokes are indistinguishable.
Vasari expressed the opinion that the manner of painting would make even "the most confident master ... despair and lose heart."
The perfect state of preservation and the fact that there is no sign of repair or overpainting is rare in a panel painting of this date.In the painting "Virgin and Child with St. Anne" the composition again picks up the theme of figures in a landscape which Wasserman describes as "breathtakingly beautiful" and harkens back to the St Jerome picture with the figure set at an oblique angle.
What makes this painting unusual is that there are two obliquely set figures superimposed.
Mary is seated on the knee of her mother, St Anne.
She leans forward to restrain the Christ Child as he plays roughly with a lamb, the sign of his own impending sacrifice.
This painting, which was copied many times, influenced Michelangelo, Raphael, and Andrea del Sarto, and through them Pontormo and Correggio.
The trends in composition were adopted in particular by the Venetian painters Tintoretto and Veronese.
Who commissioned David from Donatello?
Around 1430, Cosimo de' Medici, the foremost art patron of his era, commissioned from Donatello the bronze David (now in the Bargello) for the court of his Palazzo Medici.
This is now Donatello's most famous work.
At the time of its creation, it was the first known free-standing nude statue produced since ancient times.
Conceived fully in the round, independent of any architectural surroundings, and largely representing an allegory of the civic virtues triumphing over brutality and irrationality, it was the first major work of Renaissance sculpture.
Also from this period is the disquietingly small "Love-Atys", housed in the Bargello.Some have perceived the David as having homo-erotic qualities, and have argued that this reflected the artist's own orientation.
Details of Donatello's relationships remain speculative.
The historian Paul Strathern makes the claim that Donatello made no secret of his homosexuality, and that his behaviour was tolerated by his friends.
This may not be surprising in the context of attitudes prevailing in the 15th- and 16th-century Florentine republic.
However, little detail is known with certainty about his private life, and no mention of his sexuality has been found in the Florentine archives (in terms of denunciations) albeit which during this period are incomplete.
The main evidence comes from anecdotes by Angelo Poliziano in his ""Detti piacevoli"".When Cosimo was exiled from Florence, Donatello went to Rome, remaining until 1433.
The two works that testify to his presence in this city, the "Tomb of Giovanni Crivelli" at Santa Maria "in Aracoeli", and the "Ciborium" at St. Peter's Basilica, bear a strong stamp of classical influence.Donatello's return to Florence almost coincided with Cosimo's.
In May 1434, he signed a contract for the marble pulpit on the facade of Prato cathedral, the last project executed in collaboration with Michelozzo.
This work, a passionate, pagan, rhythmically-conceived bacchanalian dance of half-nude putti, was the forerunner of the great "Cantoria", or singing tribune, at the Duomo in Florence on which Donatello worked intermittently from 1433 to 1440 and was inspired by ancient sarcophagi and Byzantine ivory chests.
In 1435, he executed the "Annunciation" for the Cavalcanti altar in Santa Croce, inspired by 14th-century iconography, and in 1437–1443, he worked in the Old Sacristy of the San Lorenzo in Florence, on two doors and lunettes portraying saints, as well as eight stucco tondoes.
From 1438 is the wooden statue of St. John the Evangelist for Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari in Venice.
Around 1440, he executed a bust of a "Young Man with a Cameo" now in the Bargello, the first example of a lay bust portrait since the classical era.
In what year did Moore win a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London?
After the war Moore received an ex-serviceman's grant to continue his education and in 1919 he became a student at the Leeds School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him.
At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years.
In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development.
In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries.
While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum.The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals.
Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture.
Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach.
During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's "The Virgin and Child" by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical technique of "pointing".
Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing machine.In 1924, Moore won a six-month travelling scholarship which he spent in Northern Italy studying the great works of Michelangelo, Giotto di Bondone, Giovanni Pisano and several other Old Masters.
During this period he also visited Paris, took advantage of the timed-sketching classes at the Académie Colarossi, and viewed, in the Trocadero, a plaster cast of a Toltec-Maya sculptural form, the Chac Mool, previously seen in book illustrations.
The reclining figure was to have a profound effect upon Moore's work, becoming the primary motif of his sculpture.
What year did a girl snatch Warhol's wig off?
Warhol was an avid collector.
His friends referred to his numerous collections, which filled not only his four-story townhouse, but also a nearby storage unit, as "Andy's Stuff."
The true extent of his collections was not discovered until after his death, when the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh took in 641 boxes of his "Stuff.
"Warhol's collections included airplane menus, unpaid invoices, pizza dough, pornographic pulp novels, newspapers, stamps, supermarket flyers, and cookie jars, among other eccentricities.
One of his main collections was his wigs.
Warhol owned over forty and felt very protective of his hairpieces which were sewn by a New York wig-maker from hair imported from Italy.
In 1985 a girl snatched Warhol's wig off his head.
It was later discovered in Warhol's diary entry for that day that he wrote "I don't know what held me back from pushing her over the balcony.
"Another item found in Warhol's boxes at the museum in Pittsburgh was a mummified human foot from Ancient Egypt.
The curator of anthropology at Carnegie Museum of Natural History felt that Warhol most likely found it at a flea market.
When was "Hidden Faces" published?
Under the encouragement of poet Federico García Lorca, Dalí attempted an approach to a literary career through the means of the "pure novel".
In his literary production "Hidden Faces" (1944), Dalí describes, in vividly visual terms, the intrigues and love affairs of a group of dazzling, eccentric aristocrats who, with their luxurious and extravagant lifestyle, symbolize the decadence of the 1930s.
The Comte de Grainsalles and Solange de Cléda pursue an awkward love affair, but property transactions, interwar political turmoil, the French Resistance, his marriage to another woman and her responsibilities as a landowner and businesswoman drive them apart.
It is variously set in Paris, rural France, Casablanca in North Africa and Palm Springs in the United States.
Secondary characters include ageing widow Barbara Rogers, her bisexual daughter Veronica, Veronica's sometime female lover Betka, and Baba, a disfigured US fighter pilot.
The novel concludes at the end of the Second World War, with Solange dying before Grainsalles can return to his former property and reunite with her His other, nonfictional literary works include "The Secret Life of Salvador Dalí" (1942), "Diary of a Genius" (1952–63), and "Oui: The Paranoid-Critical Revolution " (1927–33).
How much did Jackson Pollock's piece "Blue Poles: Number 11, 1952" sell for at auction in 1973?
Art market.At auction.In 1973, Blue Poles "(Blue Poles: Number 11, 1952)," was purchased by the Australian Whitlam Government for the National Gallery of Australia for US $2 million (A$1.3 million at the time of payment).
At the time, this was the highest price ever paid for a modern painting.
The painting is now one of the most popular exhibits in the gallery.
It was a centerpiece of the Museum of Modern Art's 1998 retrospective in New York, the first time the painting had been shown in America since its purchase.In November 2006, Pollock's "No.
5, 1948" became the world's most expensive painting, when it was sold privately to an undisclosed buyer for the sum of $140,000,000.
Another artist record was established in 2004, when "No.
12" (1949), a medium-sized drip painting that had been shown in the United States Pavilion at the 1950 Venice Biennale, fetched $11.7 million at Christie's, New York.
In 2012, "Number 28, 1951," one of the artist’s combinations of drip and brushwork in shades of silvery gray with red, yellow and shots of blue and white, also sold at Christie's, New York, for $20.5 million—$23 million with fees—within its estimated range of $20 million to $30 million.In 2013 Pollock's "Number 19" (1948) was sold by Christies for a reported $58,363,750 during an auction that ultimately reached $495 million total sales in one night which Christies reports as a record to date as the most expensive auction of contemporary art.
when did he separate from his wife?
He and his wife of 41 years separated in 1939.
In 1941, he underwent surgery in which a colostomy was performed.
Afterwards he started using a wheelchair, and until his death he was cared for by a Russian woman, Lydia Delektorskaya, formerly one of his models.
With the aid of assistants he set about creating cut paper collages, often on a large scale, called "gouaches découpés".
His Blue Nudes series feature prime examples of this technique he called "painting with scissors"; they demonstrate the ability to bring his eye for colour and geometry to a new medium of utter simplicity, but with playful and delightful power.In the 1940s he also worked as a graphic artist and produced black-and-white illustrations for several books and over one hundred original lithographs at the Mourlot Studios in Paris.In 1941, a nursing student named Monique Bourgeois responded to an ad placed by Matisse for a nurse.
A platonic friendship developed between Matisse and Bourgeois.
He discovered that she was an amateur artist, and taught her about perspective.
After Bourgeois left the position, Matisse sometimes contacted her to request that she model for him.
Bourgeois became a Dominican nun in 1946.Matisse was much admired and repeatedly referred to by the Greek Nobelist poet Odysseas Elytis.
Elytis was introduced to Matisse through their common friend Tériade, during the work on the "Cutouts".
Matisse had painted the wall of the dining room of Tériade's residence, the "Villa Natacha" in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, which Elytis also mentioned in his poems.Matisse, thoroughly unpolitical, was shocked when he heard that his daughter Marguerite, who had been active in the Résistance during the war, was tortured (almost to death) in a Rennes prison and sentenced to the Ravensbrück concentration camp.
(Marguerite avoided further imprisonment by escaping from the Ravensbrück-bound train, which was halted during an Allied air strike; she survived in the woods until rescued by fellow resisters.
)Matisse's student Rudolf Levy was killed in the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1944.In 1947 he published "Jazz", a limited-edition artist's book of about one hundred prints of colourful paper cut collages, accompanied by his written thoughts.
Tériade, a noted twentieth-century art publisher, arranged to have Matisse's cutouts rendered as pochoir (stencil) prints.
How long are fields for non-international matches?
As the Laws were formulated in England, and were initially administered solely by the four British football associations within IFAB, the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in imperial units.
The Laws now express dimensions with approximate metric equivalents (followed by traditional units in brackets), though popular use tends to continue to use traditional units in English-speaking countries with a relatively recent history of metrication (or only partial metrication), such as Britain.The length of the pitch for international adult matches is in the range of 100–110 m (110–120 yd) and the width is in the range of 64–75 m (70–80 yd).
Fields for non-international matches may be 90–120 m (100–130 yd) length and 45–90 m (50–100 yd) in width, provided that the pitch does not become square.
In 2008, the IFAB initially approved a fixed size of 105 m (344 ft) long and 68 m (223 ft) wide as a standard pitch dimension for international matches; however, this decision was later put on hold and was never actually implemented.The longer boundary lines are "touchlines", while the shorter boundaries (on which the goals are placed) are "goal lines".
A rectangular goal is positioned at the middle of each goal line.
The inner edges of the vertical goal posts must be 7.32 m (8 yd) apart, and the lower edge of the horizontal crossbar supported by the goal posts must be 2.44 m (8 ft) above the ground.
Nets are usually placed behind the goal, but are not required by the Laws.In front of each goal is an area known as the penalty area.
This area is marked by the goal line, two lines starting on the goal line 16.5 m (18 yd) from the goalposts and extending 16.5 m (18 yd) into the pitch perpendicular to the goal line, and a line joining them.
This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul by a member of the defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick.
Other markings define the position of the ball or players at kick-offs, goal kicks, penalty kicks and corner kicks.
Where are the revised rules located?
In 1848, at Cambridge University, Mr. H. de Winton and Mr. J.C. Thring, who were both formerly at Shrewsbury School, called a meeting at Trinity College, Cambridge with 12 other representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester and Shrewsbury.
An eight-hour meeting produced what amounted to the first set of modern rules, known as the "Cambridge rules".
No copy of these rules now exists, but a revised version from circa 1856 is held in the library of Shrewsbury School.
The rules clearly favour the kicking game.
Handling was only allowed "when a player catches the ball directly from the foot" entitling them to a free kick and there was a primitive offside rule, disallowing players from "loitering" around the opponents' goal.
The Cambridge rules were not widely adopted outside English public schools and universities (but it was arguably the most significant influence on the Football Association committee members responsible for formulating the rules of Association football).
What is a squeeze play?
Several basic offensive tactics come into play with a runner on first base, including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base.
The hit and run is sometimes employed with a skillful contact hitter: the runner takes off with the pitch drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating a gap in the infield for the batter to poke the ball through.
The sacrifice bunt calls for the batter to focus on making contact with the ball so that it rolls a short distance into the infield, allowing the runner to advance into scoring position even at the expense of the batter being thrown out at first—a batter who succeeds is credited with a sacrifice.
(A batter, particularly one who is a fast runner, may also attempt to bunt for a hit.)
A sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base, aimed at bringing that runner home, is known as a squeeze play.
With a runner on third and fewer than two outs, a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be deep enough to allow the runner to tag up and score—a successful batter in this case gets credit for a sacrifice fly.
The manager will sometimes signal a batter who is ahead in the count (i.e., has more balls than strikes) to take, or not swing at, the next pitch.
How many shots does a player receive if fouled when attempting a regular two-point shot?
An attempt to unfairly disadvantage an opponent through physical contact is illegal and is called a foul.
These are most commonly committed by defensive players; however, they can be committed by offensive players as well.
Players who are fouled either receive the ball to pass inbounds again, or receive one or more free throws if they are fouled in the act of shooting, depending on whether the shot was successful.
One point is awarded for making a free throw, which is attempted from a line from the basket.The referee may use discretion in calling fouls (for example, by considering whether an unfair advantage was gained), sometimes making fouls controversial calls or no-calls.
The calling of fouls can vary between games, leagues and even among referees.A player or coach who shows poor sportsmanship, such as by arguing with a referee or by fighting with another player, can be charged with a more serious foul called a technical foul.
The penalty involves free throws (where, unlike a personal foul, the other team can choose any player to shoot) and varies among leagues.
Repeated incidents can result in disqualification.
A blatant foul involving physical contact that is either excessive or unnecessary is called an intentional foul (flagrant foul in the NBA).
In FIBA, a foul resulting in ejection is called a disqualifying foul, while in leagues other than the NBA, such a foul is referred to as flagrant.If a team exceeds a certain limit of team fouls in a given period (quarter or half) – four for NBA and international games – the opposing team is awarded one or two free throws on all subsequent non-shooting fouls for that period, the number depending on the league.
In the US college and high school games, if a team reaches 7 fouls in a half, the opposing team is awarded one free throw, along with a second shot if the first is made.
This is called shooting "one-and-one".
If a team exceeds 10 fouls in the half, the opposing team is awarded two free throws on all subsequent fouls for the half.When a team shoots foul shots, the opponents may not interfere with the shooter, nor may they try to regain possession until the last or potentially last free throw is in the air.After a team has committed a specified number of fouls, it is said to be "in the penalty".
On scoreboards, this is usually signified with an indicator light reading "Bonus" or "Penalty" with an illuminated directional arrow indicating that team is to receive free throws when fouled by the opposing team.
(Some scoreboards also indicate the number of fouls committed.
)If a team misses the first shot of a two-shot situation, the opposing team must wait for the completion of the second shot before attempting to reclaim possession of the ball and continuing play.If a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is unsuccessful, the player is awarded a number of free throws equal to the value of the attempted shot.
A player fouled while attempting a regular two-point shot, then, receives two shots.
A player fouled while attempting a three-point shot, on the other hand, receives three shots.If a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is successful, typically the playerwill be awarded one additional free throw for one point.
In combination with a regularshot, this is called a "three-point play" or "four-point play" (or more colloquially, an "and one") because of the basket made at the time of the foul (2 or 3 points) and the additional free throw (1 point).
When were the Premier Events introduced into Tennis?
Women's tournament structure.Premier events.Premier events for women form the most prestigious level of events on the Women's Tennis Association Tour after the Grand Slam tournaments.
These events offer the largest rewards in terms of points and prize money.
Within the Premier category are Premier Mandatory, Premier 5, and Premier tournaments.
The Premier events were introduced in 2009 replacing the previous Tier I and II tournament categories.
Currently four tournaments are Premier Mandatory, five tournaments are Premier 5, and twelve tournaments are Premier.
The first tiering system in women's tennis was introduced in 1988.
At the time of its creation, only two tournaments, the Lipton International Players Championships in Florida and the German Open in Berlin, comprised the Tier I category.
What is the common length (in yards) of a pool used for competitive swimming in the USA?
Swimming as a sport predominantly involves competition among participants to be the fastest over a given distance under self propulsion.
Different distances are swum in different levels of competition.
For example, swimming has been part of Olympic Swimming since 1896, and the current program contains events from 50m to 1500m in length, across all four main strokes and medley.
The sport is governed internationally by the Fédération Internationale de Natation (FINA), and competition pools for FINA events are 25 or 50 metres in length.
In the United States of America, USA Swimming is the governing body and a pool 25 yards in length is commonly used for competition.
There are other swimming and water related sporting disciplines including diving, synchronised swimming and water polo, as well as sports which include a swimming element, such as triathlon and modern pentathlon.
Where was basketball invented?
History.Origin of volleyball.On February 9, 1895, in Holyoke, Massachusetts (USA), William G. Morgan, a YMCA physical education director, created a new game called "Mintonette" as a pastime to be played (preferably) indoors and by any number of players.
The game took some of its characteristics from tennis and handball.
Another indoor sport, basketball, was catching on in the area, having been invented just ten miles (sixteen kilometers) away in the city of Springfield, Massachusetts, only four years before.
Mintonette was designed to be an indoor sport, less rough than basketball, for older members of the YMCA, while still requiring a bit of athletic effort.The first rules, written down by William G Morgan, called for a net high, a court, and any number of players.
A match was composed of nine innings with three serves for each team in each inning, and no limit to the number of ball contacts for each team before sending the ball to the opponents’ court.
In case of a serving error, a second try was allowed.
Hitting the ball into the net was considered a foul (with loss of the point or a side-out)—except in the case of the first-try serve.After an observer, Alfred Halstead, noticed the volleying nature of the game at its first exhibition match in 1896, played at the International YMCA Training School (now called Springfield College), the game quickly became known as "volleyball" (it was originally spelled as two words: ""volley ball"").
Volleyball rules were slightly modified by the International YMCA Training School and the game spread around the country to various YMCAs.
USGA stands for what?
The rules of golf are internationally standardised and are jointly governed by The R&A, spun off in 2004 from The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews (founded 1754), and the United States Golf Association (USGA).The underlying principle of the rules is fairness.
As stated on the back cover of the official rule book:
"Play the ball as it lies, play the course as you find it, and if you cannot do either, do what is fair.
"
There are strict regulations regarding the amateur status of golfers.
Essentially, anybody who has ever received payment or compensation for giving instruction, or played golf for money, is not considered an amateur and may not participate in competitions limited solely to amateurs.
However, amateur golfers may receive expenses that comply with strict guidelines and they may accept non-cash prizes within the limits established by the Rules of Amateur Status.In addition to the officially printed rules, golfers also abide by a set of guidelines called golf etiquette.
Etiquette guidelines cover matters such as safety, fairness, pace of play, and a player's obligation to contribute to the care of the course.
Though there are no penalties for breach of etiquette rules, players generally follow the rules of golf etiquette in an effort to improve everyone's playing experience.
When are flick serves used?
Both pairs will try to gain and maintain the attack, smashing downwards when possible.
Whenever possible, a pair will adopt an ideal attacking formation with one player hitting down from the rearcourt, and his partner in the midcourt intercepting all smash returns except the lift.
If the rearcourt attacker plays a dropshot, his partner will move into the forecourt to threaten the net reply.
If a pair cannot hit downwards, they will use flat strokes in an attempt to gain the attack.
If a pair is forced to lift or clear the shuttlecock, then they must defend: they will adopt a side-by-side position in the rear midcourt, to cover the full width of their court against the opponents' smashes.
In doubles, players generally smash to the middle ground between two players in order to take advantage of confusion and clashes.At high levels of play, the backhand serve has become popular to the extent that forehand serves have become fairly rare at a high level of play.
The straight low serve is used most frequently, in an attempt to prevent the opponents gaining the attack immediately.
Flick serves are used to prevent the opponent from anticipating the low serve and attacking it decisively.At high levels of play, doubles rallies are extremely fast.
Men's doubles is the most aggressive form of badminton, with a high proportion of powerful jump smashes and very quick reflex exchanges.
Because of this, spectator interest is sometimes greater for men's doubles than for singles.
What is jibbing?
Jibbing is technical riding on non-standard surfaces, usually performing tricks.
The word "jib" is both a noun and a verb, depending on the usage of the word.
As a noun: a jib includes metal rails, boxes, benches, concrete ledges, walls, vehicles, rocks and logs.
As a verb: to jib is referring to the action of jumping, sliding or riding on top of objects other than snow.
It is directly influenced by grinding a skateboard.
Jibbing is a freestyle snowboarding technique of riding.
Typically jibbing occurs in a snowboard resort park but can also be done in urban environments.Freeride snowboarders also commonly find incidental jibs, such as a downed tree, that prove suitable to ride over in the course of their line or run.
how long has fencing been around?
Fencing has a long history with universities and schools for at least 500 years.
At least one style of fencing, Mensur in Germany, is practiced only within universities.
University students compete internationally at the World University Games.
The United States holds two national level university tournaments including the NCAA championship and the USACFC National Championships tournaments in the USA and the BUCS fencing championships in the United Kingdom.Equipment costs and the relatively small scale of the sport limits university fencing to a small number of schools.
National fencing organizations have set up programs to encourage more students to fence.
Examples include the Regional Youth Circuit program in the USA and the Leon Paul Youth Development series in the UK.In recent years, attempts have been made to introduce fencing to a wider and younger audience, by using foam and plastic swords, which require much less protective equipment.
This makes it much less expensive to provide classes, and makes it easier to take fencing to a wider range of schools than traditionally has been the case.
There is even a competition series in Scotland – the Plastic-and-Foam Fencing FunLeague – specifically for Primary and early Secondary school-age children using this equipment.The UK hosts two national competitions in which schools compete against each other directly: the Public Schools Fencing Championship, a competition only open to Independent Schools, and the Scottish Secondary Schools Championships, open to all secondary schools in Scotland.
It contains both teams and individual events and is highly anticipated.
Schools organise matches directly against one another and school age pupils can compete individually in the British Youth Championships.Many universities in Ontario, Canada have fencing teams that participate in an annual inter-university competition called the OUA Finals.
What year saw the first attempts at turning the recreation into a modern sport?
The 1840s saw the first attempts at turning the recreation into a modern sport.
The first Grand National Archery Society meeting was held in York in 1844 and over the next decade the extravagant and festive practices of the past were gradually whittled away and the rules were standardised as the 'York Round' - a series of shoots at 60, 80, and 100 yards.
Horace A. Ford helped to improve archery standards and pioneered new archery techniques.
He won the Grand National 11 times in a row and published a highly influential guide to the sport in 1856.Towards the end of the 19th century, the sport experienced declining participation as alternative sports such as croquet and tennis became more popular among the middle class.
By 1889, just 50 archery clubs were left in Britain, but it was still included as a sport at the 1900 Paris Olympics.In the United States, primitive archery was revived in the early 20th century.
The last of the Yahi Indian tribe, a native known as Ishi, came out of hiding in California in 1911.
His doctor, Saxton Pope, learned many of Ishi's traditional archery skills, and popularized them.
The Pope and Young Club, founded in 1961 and named in honor of Pope and his friend, Arthur Young, became one of North America's leading bowhunting and conservation organizations.
Founded as a nonprofit scientific organization, the Club was patterned after the prestigious Boone and Crockett Club and advocated responsible bowhunting by promoting quality, fair chase hunting, and sound conservation practices.From the 1920s, professional engineers took an interest in archery, previously the exclusive field of traditional craft experts.
They led the commercial development of new forms of bow including the modern recurve and compound bow.
These modern forms are now dominant in modern Western archery; traditional bows are in a minority.
In the 1980s, the skills of traditional archery were revived by American enthusiasts, and combined with the new scientific understanding.
Much of this expertise is available in the "Traditional Bowyer's Bibles" (see Additional reading).
Modern game archery owes much of its success to Fred Bear, an American bow hunter and bow manufacturer.
what is one of the oldest forms of combat
Wrestling represents one of the oldest forms of combat.
Literary references to it occur as early as in the Iliad, in which Homer recounts the Trojan War of the 13th or 12th century BC.
The origins of wrestling go back 15,000 years through cave drawings in France.
Babylonian and Egyptian reliefs show wrestlers using most of the holds known in the present-day sport.In ancient Greece wrestling occupied a prominent place in legend and literature; wrestling competition, brutal in many aspects, served as the focal sport of the ancient Olympic Games.
The ancient Romans borrowed heavily from Greek wrestling, but eliminated much of its brutality.During the Middle Ages (fifth century to fifteenth century) wrestling remained popular and enjoyed the patronage of many royal families, including those of France, Japan and England.
Early European settlers in America brought a strong wrestling tradition with them if they came from England.
The settlers also found wrestling to be popular among Native Americans.
Amateur wrestling flourished throughout the early years of the North American colonies and served as a popular activity at country fairs, holiday celebrations, and in military exercises.
The first organized national wrestling tournament took place in New York City in 1888, and wrestling has been an event at every modern Olympic Games since the 1904 games in Saint Louis, Missouri (a demonstration had been performed at the first modern Olympics).
The International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles (FILA) originated in 1912 in Antwerp, Belgium.
The 1st NCAA Wrestling Championships were also held in 1912, in Ames, Iowa.
USA Wrestling, located in Colorado Springs, Colorado, became the national governing body of amateur wrestling in 1983.
It conducts competitions for all age-levels.
What was Mike Tyson notoriously known for?
In-fighters/swarmers (sometimes called "pressure fighters") attempt to stay close to an opponent, throwing intense flurries and combinations of hooks and uppercuts.
A successful in-fighter often needs a good "chin" because swarming usually involves being hit with many jabs before they can maneuver inside where they are more effective.
In-fighters operate best at close range because they are generally shorter and have less reach than their opponents and thus are more effective at a short distance where the longer arms of their opponents make punching awkward.
However, several fighters tall for their division have been relatively adept at in-fighting as well as out-fighting.The essence of a swarmer is non-stop aggression.
Many short in-fighters utilize their stature to their advantage, employing a bob-and-weave defense by bending at the waist to slip underneath or to the sides of incoming punches.
Unlike blocking, causing an opponent to miss a punch disrupts his balance, permits forward movement past the opponent's extended arm and keeps the hands free to counter.
A distinct advantage that in-fighters have is when throwing uppercuts where they can channel their entire bodyweight behind the punch; Mike Tyson was famous for throwing devastating uppercuts.
Marvin Hagler was known for his hard "chin", punching power, body attack and the stalking of his opponents.
Some in-fighters, like Mike Tyson, have been known for being notoriously hard to hit.
The key to a swarmer is aggression, endurance, chin, and bobbing-and-weaving.Notable in-fighters include Julio César Chávez, Miguel Cotto, Joe Frazier, Danny García, Mike Tyson, Manny Pacquiao, Saúl Álvarez, Rocky Marciano, Jack Dempsey, Wayne McCullough, Harry Greb, David Tua and Ricky Hatton.
In what city does the world's oldest annual marathon take place?
 races.Annually, more than 500 marathons are organized worldwide.
Some of these belong to the Association of International Marathons and Distance Races (AIMS) which has grown since its foundation in 1982 to embrace over 300 member events in 83 countries and territories.
The marathons of Berlin, Boston, Chicago, London, New York City and Tokyo form the World Marathon Majors series, awarding $500,000 annually to the best overall male and female performers in the series.In 2006, the editors of Runner's World selected a "World's Top 10 Marathons", in which the Amsterdam, Honolulu, Paris, Rotterdam, and Stockholm marathons were featured along with the five mentioned above.
Other notable large marathons include United States Marine Corps Marathon, Los Angeles, and Rome.
The Boston Marathon is the world's oldest annual marathon, inspired by the success of the 1896 Olympic marathon and held since 1897.
The oldest annual marathon in Europe is the Košice Peace Marathon, held since 1924 in Košice, Slovakia.
The historic Polytechnic Marathon was discontinued in 1996.
The Athens Classic Marathon traces the route of the 1896 Olympic course, starting in Marathon on the eastern coast of Attica, site of the Battle of Marathon of 490 B.C.E., and ending at the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens.The Midnight Sun Marathon is held in Tromsø, Norway at 70 degrees north.
Using unofficial and temporary courses, measured by GPS, races of marathon distance are now held at the North Pole, in Antarctica and over desert terrain.
Other unusual marathons include the Great Wall Marathon on The Great Wall of China, the Big Five Marathon among the safari wildlife of South Africa, the Great Tibetan Marathon – a marathon in an atmosphere of Tibetan Buddhism at an altitude of , and the Polar Circle Marathon on the permanent ice cap of Greenland.The Intercontinental Istanbul Eurasia Marathon is the only marathon where participants run over two continents (Europe and Asia) during the course of a single event.
In the Detroit Free Press Marathon, participants cross the US/Canadian border twice.
The Niagara Falls International Marathon includes one international border crossing, via the Peace Bridge from Buffalo, New York, United States to Fort Erie, Ontario, Canada.
What techniques are allowed in tae kwon do
Under World Taekwondo Federation and Olympic rules, sparring is a full-contact event and takes place between two competitors in an area measuring 8 meters square.
A win can occur by points, or if one competitor is unable to continue (knockout) the other competitor wins.
Each match consists of three semi-continuous rounds of contact, with one minute's rest between rounds.
There are two age categories: 14–17 years and 18 years and older.
Depending on the type of tournament and club, competitors may also wear fist protectors, foot protectors, instep guards, helmets, or mouth guards.Points are awarded for permitted, accurate, and powerful techniques delivered to the legal scoring areas; light contact does not score any points.
The only techniques allowed are kicks (delivering a strike using an area of the foot below the ankle) and punches (delivering a strike using the closed fist).
In most competitions, points are awarded by three corner judges using electronic scoring tallies.
Several A-Class tournaments, however, are now experimenting with electronic scoring equipment contained within the competitors' body protectors.
This limits corner judges to scoring only attacks to the head.
Some believe that the new electronic scoring system will help to reduce controversy concerning judging decisions, but this technology is still not universally accepted.Beginning in 2009, a kick or punch that makes contact with the opponent's "hogu" (the body guard that functions as a scoring target) scores one point.
If a kick to the "hogu" involves a technique that includes fully turning the attacking competitor's body, so that the back is fully exposed to the targeted competitor during execution of the technique (spinning kick), an additional point is awarded.
A kick to the head scores three points; as of October 2010 an additional point is awarded if a turning kick was used to execute this attack.
Punches to the head are not allowed.
As of March 2010, no additional points are awarded for knocking down an opponent (beyond the normal points awarded for legal strikes).The referee can give penalties at any time for rule-breaking, such as hitting an area not recognized as a target, usually the legs or neck.
Penalties are divided into "Kyong-go" (warning penalty) and "Gam-jeom" (deduction penalty).
Two "Kyong-go" are counted as an addition of one point for the opposing contestant.
However, the final odd-numbered "Kyong-go" is not counted in the grand total.At the end of three rounds, the competitor with most points wins the match.
In the event of a tie, a fourth "sudden death" overtime round, sometimes called a "Golden Point", is held to determine the winner after a one-minute rest period.
In this round, the first competitor to score a point wins the match.
If there is no score in the additional round, the winner is decided by superiority, as determined by the refereeing officials.Until 2008, if one competitor gained a 7 point lead over the other, or if one competitor reached a total of 12 points, then that competitor was immediately declared the winner and the match ended.
These rules were abolished by the WTF at the start of 2009.
In October 2010 the WTF reintroduced a point-gap rule, stating that if a competitor has a 12-point lead at the end of the second round or achieves a 12-point lead at any point in the third round, then the match is over and that competitor is declared the winner.
What is Judo?
Judo is a hierarchical art, where seniority of judoka is designated by what is known as the - ranking system.
This system was developed by Jigoro Kano based on the ranking system in the board game Go.
Beginning students progress through kyu grades towards dan grades.A judoka's position within the kyu-dan ranking system is displayed by the color of their belt.
Beginning students typically wear a white belt, progressing through descending kyu ranks until they are deemed to have achieved a level of competence sufficient to be a dan grade, at which point they wear the .
The kyu-dan ranking system has since been widely adopted by modern martial arts.The highest grade ever awarded "jūdan" (tenth degree black belt) has no formal requirements and is decided by the president of the Kodokan, currently Kano Jigoro's grandson Yukimitsu Kano.
As of 2011, fifteen Japanese men have been promoted to this rank by the Kodokan, three of whom are still alive; the IJF and Western national federations have promoted another seven who are not recognized (at that level of rank) by the Kodokan.
On July 28, 2011, the promotion board of USA Judo awarded Keiko Fukuda the rank of 10th "dan", who is the first woman to be promoted to judo's highest level, albeit not a Kodokan-recognized rank.Although "dan" ranks tend to be consistent between national organizations there is more variation in the "kyū" grades, with some countries having more "kyū" grades.
Although initially "kyū" grade belt colours were uniformly white, today a variety of colours are used.
The first black belts to denote a Dan rank in the 1880s, initially the wide obi was used; as practitioners trained in kimono, only white and black obi were used.
It was not until the early 1900s, after the introduction of the judogi, that an expanded colored belt system of awarding rank was created.
After which Olympic year was the 40mm ball introduced?
Equipment.Ball.The international rules specify that the game is played with a light 2.7 gram, 40 mm diameter ball.
The rules say that the ball shall bounce up 24–26 cm when dropped from a height of 30.5 cm onto a standard steel block thereby having a coefficient of restitution of 0.89 to 0.92.
The 40 mm ball was introduced after the 2000 Olympic Games.
However, this created some controversy as the Chinese National Team argued that this was merely to give non-Chinese players a better chance of winning since the new type of balls has a slower speed, while at that time most Chinese players were playing with fast attack and smashes.
A 40 mm table tennis ball is slower and spins less than the original 38 mm (1.5 inch) one.
The ball is made of a high-bouncing air-filled celluloid or similar plastics material, colored white or orange, with a matte finish.
The choice of ball color is made according to the table color and its surroundings.
For example, a white ball is easier to see on a green or blue table than it is on a gray table.
Some Table Tennis balls have ball rated in stars so that more professional players can know which ball to use.Manufacturers often indicate the quality of the ball with a star-rating system, usually from one to three, three being the highest grade.
As this system is not standard across manufacturers, the only way a ball may be used in official competition is upon ITTF approval.
The ITTF approval can be seen printed on the ball.
Which state is primarily Morman?
The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion and forbids Congress from passing laws respecting its establishment.
Christianity is by far the most common religion practiced in the U.S., but other religions are followed, too.
In a 2013 survey, 56% of Americans said that religion played a "very important role in their lives", a far higher figure than that of any other wealthy nation.
In a 2009 Gallup poll 42% of Americans said that they attended church weekly or almost weekly; the figures ranged from a low of 23% in Vermont to a high of 63% in Mississippi.According to a 2012 survey, 73% of adults identified themselves as Christian, down from 86.4% in 1990.Protestant denominations accounted for 48%, while Roman Catholicism, at 22%, was the largest individual denomination.
The total reporting non-Christian religions in 2012 was 6%, up from 4% in 2007.
Other religions include Judaism (1.7%), Buddhism (0.7%), Islam (0.6%), Hinduism (0.4%), and Unitarian Universalism (0.3%).
The survey also reported that 19.6% of Americans described themselves as agnostic, atheist or simply having no religion, up from 8.2% in 1990.
There are also Baha'i, Sikh, Jain, Shinto, Confucian, Taoist, Druid, Native American, Wiccan, humanist and deist communities.Protestantism is the largest group of religions in the United States, with Baptists being the largest Protestant sect, and the Southern Baptist Convention being the largest Protestant denomination in the U.S. Roman Catholicism in the U.S. has its origin in the Spanish and French colonization of the Americas, and later grew due to Irish, Italian, Polish, German and Hispanic immigration.
Rhode Island is the only state where the majority of the population is Catholic.
Lutheranism in the U.S. has its origin in immigration from Northern Europe.
North and South Dakota are the only states in which a plurality of the population is Lutheran.
Utah is the only state where Mormonism is the religion of the majority of the population.
Mormonism is also relatively common in parts of Idaho, Nevada and Wyoming.The Bible Belt is an informal term for a region in the Southern United States in which socially conservative evangelical Protestantism is a significant part of the culture and Christian church attendance across the denominations is generally higher than the nation's average.
By contrast, religion plays the least important role in New England and in the Western United States.As with other Western countries, the U.S. is becoming less religious.
Irreligion is growing rapidly among Americans under 30.
Polls show that overall American confidence in organized religion is declining, and that younger Americans in particular are becoming increasingly irreligious.
What is the staple food of china?
Chinese cuisine is highly diverse, drawing on several millennia of culinary history.
The dynastic emperors of ancient China were known to have many dining chambers in their palaces, with each chamber divided into several departments, each responsible for a specific type of dish.
China's staple food is rice.
Pork is the most popular meat in China, accounting for about three-fourths of the country's total meat consumption.
Spices are central to Chinese cuisine.
Numerous foreign offshoots of Chinese food, such as Hong Kong cuisine and American Chinese food, have emerged in the various nations that play host to the Chinese diaspora.
what percentage of russian pop. belongs to european groups
Ethnic Russians comprise 81% of the country's population.
The Russian Federation is also home to several sizeable minorities.
In all, 160 different other ethnic groups and indigenous peoples live within its borders.
Though Russia's population is comparatively large, its density is low because of the country's enormous size.
Population is densest in European Russia, near the Ural Mountains, and in southwest Siberia.
73% of the population lives in urban areas while 27% in rural ones.
The results of the 2010 Census show a total population of 142,856,536.Russia's population peaked at 148,689,000 in 1991, just before the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
It began to experience a rapid decline starting in the mid-1990s.
The decline has slowed to near stagnation in recent years because of reduced death rates, increased birth rates and increased immigration.In 2009, Russia recorded annual population growth for the first time in fifteen years, with total growth of 10,500.
279,906 migrants arrived to the Russian Federation the same year, of which 93% came from CIS countries.
The number of Russian emigrants steadily declined from 359,000 in 2000 to 32,000 in 2009.
There are also an estimated 10 million illegal immigrants from the ex-Soviet states in Russia.
Roughly 116 million ethnic Russians live in Russia and about 20 million more live in other former republics of the Soviet Union, mostly in Ukraine and Kazakhstan.The 2010 census recorded 81% of the population as ethnically Russian, and 19% as other ethnicities: 3.7% Tatars; 1.4% Ukrainians; 1.1% Bashkirs; 1% Chuvashes; 11.8% others and unspecified.
According to the Census, 84.93% of the Russian population belongs to European ethnic groups (Slavic, Germanic, Finnic other than Ugric, Greek, and others).
This is a decline from the 2002, when they constituted for more than 86% of the population.Russia's birth rate is higher than that of most European countries (12.6 births per 1000 people in 2010 compared to the European Union average of 9.90 per 1000), but its death rate is also substantially higher (in 2010, Russia's death rate was 14.3 per 1000 people compared to the EU average of 10.28 per 1000).
The Russian Ministry of Health and Social Affairs predicted that by 2011 the death rate would equal the birth rate because of increase in fertility and decline in mortality.
The government is implementing a number of programs designed to increase the birth rate and attract more migrants.
Monthly government child-assistance payments were doubled to US$55, and a one-time payment of US$9,200 was offered to women who had a second child since 2007.In 2006, in a bid to compensate for the country's demographic decline, the Russian government started simplifying immigration laws and launched a state program "for providing assistance to voluntary immigration of ethnic Russians from former Soviet republics".
In 2009 Russia experienced its highest birth rate since the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
In 2012, the birth rate increased again.
Russia recorded 1,896,263 births, the highest number since 1990, and even exceeding annual births during the period 1967–1969, with a TFR of about 1.7, the highest since 1991.
(Source: Vital statistics table below)In August 2012, as the country saw its first demographic growth since the 1990s, President Putin declared that Russia's population could reach 146 million by 2025, mainly as a result of immigration.
what age are under the Department of Education in England?
The Department for Education is the government department responsible for issues affecting people in England up to the age of 19, including education.
State-run and -funded schools are attended by approximately 93% of English schoolchildren.
Of these, a minority are faith schools, primarily Church of England or Catholic.
Between three and four is nursery school, 4 and 11 is primary school, and 11 to 16 is secondary school.
After finishing compulsory education, pupils take a GCSE examination, following which they may decide to continue in further education for two years.
Further education colleges, such as sixth form colleges are either separate or attached to the secondary school institution and prepare students to sit A-Level examinations, for higher education at universities.Although most English secondary schools are comprehensive, in some areas there are selective intake grammar schools, to which entrance is subject to passing the eleven plus exam.
Around 7.2% of English schoolchildren attend private schools, which are funded by private sources.
Standards in state schools are monitored by the Office for Standards in Education, and in private schools by the Independent Schools Inspectorate.Students normally enter universities in the United Kingdom from 18 onwards, where they study for an academic degree.
There are over 90 universities in England, all but one of which are public.
The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is the government department responsible for higher education in England.
Students are generally entitled to student loans for maintenance.
The first degree offered to undergraduates is the Bachelor's degree, which usually takes three years to complete.
Students are then eligible for a postgraduate degree, a Master's degree, taking one year, or a Doctorate degree, which takes three.England's universities include some of the highest-ranked universities in the world; the University of Cambridge, Imperial College London, the University of Oxford and University College London are all ranked in the global top 10 in the 2010 "QS World University Rankings".
The London School of Economics has been described as the world's leading social science institution for both teaching and research.
The London Business School is considered one of the world's leading business schools and in 2010 its MBA programme was ranked best in the world by the "Financial Times".
Academic degrees in England are usually split into classes: first class (I), upper second class (II:1), lower second class (II:2) and third (III), and unclassified (below third class).The King's School, Canterbury and King's School, Rochester are the oldest schools in the English-speaking world.
Many of England's better-known schools, such as Winchester College, Eton College, St Paul's School, Rugby School, and Harrow School are fee-paying institutions.
when was frances musical golden age
France has a long and varied musical history.
It experienced a golden age in the 17th century thanks to Louis XIV, who employed several musicians and composers in the royal court.
The most renowned composers of this period include Marc-Antoine Charpentier, François Couperin, Michel-Richard Delalande, Jean-Baptiste Lully and Marin Marais, all of them composers at the court.
After the death of the "Roi Soleil", French musical creation lost dynamism, but in the next century the music of Jean-Philippe Rameau reached some prestige, and today he is still one of the most renowned French composers.French classical music knew a revival in the 19th and 20th century, at the end of the romantic movement, at first with opera composers Hector Berlioz, Georges Bizet, Gabriel Fauré, Charles Gounod, Jacques Offenbach, Édouard Lalo, Jules Massenet and Camille Saint-Saëns.
This period was a golden age for operas, being popular in the country the opéra bouffon, the opera-ballet and the opéra comique genres.
Later came precursors of modern classical music Érik Satie, Francis Poulenc, and above all Maurice Ravel and Claude Debussy, who invented new musical forms.
More recently, at the middle of the 20th century, Maurice Ohana, Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Boulez contributed to the evolutions of contemporary classical music.French music then followed the rapid emergence of pop and rock music at the middle of the 20th century.
Although English-speaking creations achieved popularity in the country, French pop music, known as "chanson française", has also remained very popular.
Among the most important French artists of the century are Édith Piaf, Georges Brassens, Léo Ferré, Charles Aznavour and Serge Gainsbourg.
Although there are very few rock bands in France compared to English-speaking countries, bands such as Noir Désir, Mano Negra, Niagara, Les Rita Mitsouko and more recently Superbus, Phoenix and Gojira have reached worldwide popularity.Other French artists with international careers have been popular in several countries, for example female singers Dalida, Mireille Mathieu and Mylène Farmer, electronic music pioneers Jean-Michel Jarre, Laurent Garnier and Bob Sinclar, and later Martin Solveig and David Guetta.
In the 1990s and 2000s (decade), electronic duos Daft Punk, Justice and Air also reached worldwide popularity and contributed to the reputation of modern electronic music in the world.Among current musical events and institutions in France, many are dedicated to classical music and operas.
The most prestigious institutions are the state-owned Paris National Opera (with its two sites Palais Garnier and Opéra Bastille), the Opéra National de Lyon, the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris, the Théâtre du Capitole in Toulouse and the Grand Théâtre de Bordeaux.
As for music festivals, there are several events organized, the most popular being the Eurockéennes and Rock en Seine.
The Fête de la Musique, imitated by many foreign cities, was first launched by the French government in 1982.
Major music halls and venues in France include Le Zénith sites present in many cities and other places in Paris (Paris Olympia, Théâtre Mogador, Élysée Montmartre, etc.
).
what are school outfits for south koreans
Education in South Korea is regarded as crucial to financial and social success, and competition is consequently fierce, with many participating in intense outside tutoring to supplement classes.
In the 2006 results of the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment, South Korea came first in problem solving, third in mathematics and seventh in science.
South Korea's education system is technologically advanced and it is the world's first country to bring high-speed fibre-optic broadband internet access to every primary and secondary school nation-wide.
Using this infrastructure, the country has developed the first Digital Textbooks in the world, which will be distributed for free to every primary and secondary school nation-wide by 2013.A centralised administration in South Korea oversees the process for the education of children from kindergarten to the third and final year of high school.
South Korea has adopted a new educational program to increase the number of their foreign students through 2010.
According to Ministry of Education, Science and Technology estimate, by that time, the number of scholarships for foreign students in South Korea will be doubled, and the number of foreign students will reach 100,000.The school year is divided into two semesters, the first of which begins in the beginning of March and ends in mid-July, the second of which begins in late August and ends in mid-February.
The schedules are not uniformly standardized and vary from school to school.Most South Korean middle schools and high schools have school uniforms, modeled on western-style uniforms.
Boys' uniforms usually consists of trousers and white shirts, and girls wear skirts and white shirts (this only applies in middle schools and high schools).
What effect did the oil crisis of 1973 have on Japan?
In the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s.
Responding to rising concern about the problem, the government introduced several environmental protection laws in 1970.
The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources.
Current environmental issues include urban air pollution (NOx, suspended particulate matter, and toxics), waste management, water eutrophication, nature conservation, climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.Japan is one of the world's leaders in the development of new environment-friendly technologies, and is ranked 26th best in the world in the 2014 Environmental Performance Index.
As a signatory of the Kyoto Protocol, and host of the 1997 conference which created it, Japan is under treaty obligation to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps to curb climate change.
Which dance form of Uttar Pradesh has been accorded classical dance status by India's National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama?
Indian music ranges over various traditions and regional styles.
Classical music encompasses two genres and their various folk offshoots: the northern Hindustani and southern Carnatic schools.
Regionalised popular forms include filmi and folk music; the syncretic tradition of the "bauls" is a well-known form of the latter.
Indian dance also features diverse folk and classical forms.
Among the better-known folk dances are the "bhangra" of the Punjab, the "bihu" of Assam, the "chhau" of West Bengal and Jharkhand,"Garba" and "Dandiya" of Gujarat, "sambalpuri" of Odisha, "ghoomar" of Rajasthan, and the "lavani" of Maharashtra.
Eight dance forms, many with narrative forms and mythological elements, have been accorded classical dance status by India's National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama.
These are: "bharatanatyam" of the state of Tamil Nadu, "kathak" of Uttar Pradesh, "kathakali" and "mohiniyattam" of Kerala," kuchipudi" of Andhra Pradesh, "manipuri" of Manipur, "odissi" of Odisha, and the "sattriya" of Assam.
Theatre in India melds music, dance, and improvised or written dialogue.
Often based on Hindu mythology, but also borrowing from medieval romances or social and political events, Indian theatre includes the "bhavai" of Gujarat, the "jatra" of West Bengal, the "nautanki" and "ramlila" of North India, "tamasha" of Maharashtra, "burrakatha" of Andhra Pradesh, "terukkuttu" of Tamil Nadu, and the "yakshagana" of Karnataka.
What country has the world's highest leve of biodiversity?
Indonesia's size, tropical climate, and archipelagic geography, support the world's second highest level of biodiversity (after Brazil), and its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species.
The islands of the Sunda Shelf (Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Bali) were once linked to the Asian mainland, and have a wealth of Asian fauna.
Large species such as the tiger, rhinoceros, orangutan, elephant, and leopard, were once abundant as far east as Bali, but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically.
Forests cover approximately 60% of the country.
In Sumatra and Kalimantan, these are predominantly of Asian species.
However, the forests of the smaller, and more densely populated Java, have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture.
Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, and Maluku – having been long separated from the continental landmasses—have developed their own unique flora and fauna.
Papua was part of the Australian landmass, and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia, including over 600 bird species.Indonesia is second only to Australia in terms of total endemic species, with 36% of its 1,531 species of bird and 39% of its 515 species of mammal being endemic.Indonesia's of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country's high level of biodiversity.
Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems, including beaches, sand dunes, estuaries, mangroves, coral reefs, sea grass beds, coastal mudflats, tidal flats, algal beds, and small island ecosystems.
Indonesia is one of Coral Triangle countries with the world's greatest diversity of coral reef fish with more than 1,650 species in eastern Indonesia only.
The British naturalist, Alfred Wallace, described a dividing line between the distribution and peace of Indonesia's Asian and Australasian species.
Known as the Wallace Line, it runs roughly north-south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf, between Kalimantan and Sulawesi, and along the deep Lombok Strait, between Lombok and Bali.
West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian; moving east from Lombok, they are increasingly Australian.
In his 1869 book, "The Malay Archipelago", Wallace described numerous species unique to the area.
The region of islands between his line and New Guinea is now termed Wallacea.Indonesia's high population and rapid industrialization present serious environmental issues, which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak, under-resourced governance.
Issues include large-scale deforestation (much of it illegal) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore; over-exploitation of marine resources; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization and economic development, including air pollution, traffic congestion, garbage management, and reliable water and waste water services.
Deforestation and the destruction of peatlands make Indonesia the world's third largest emitter of greenhouse gases.
Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species, including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) as threatened, and 15 identified as critically endangered, including Bali Starling, Sumatran Orangutan, and Javan Rhinoceros.
Much of Indonesia's deforestation is caused by forest clearing for the palm oil Industry, which has cleared 18 million hectares of forest for palm oil expansion.
Palm oil expansion requires land reallocation as well as changes to the local and natural ecosystems.
Palm oil expansion can generate wealth for local communities if done right.
If down wrong it can degrade ecosystems and cause social conflicts.
When was the last time Brazil was invaded?
The armed forces of Brazil are the second-largest in Latin America, consist of the Brazilian Army, the Brazilian Navy, and the Brazilian Air Force with a total of 371,199 active personnel.The Army has 235,978 active personnel.
The Military Police (States' Military Police) is described as an ancillary force of the Army by the constitution, but is under the control of each state's governor.
The Navy once operated some of the most powerful warships in the world with the two dreadnoughts, which sparked a South American dreadnought race between Argentina, Brazil, and Chile.
Today, it is a green water force and one of the ten navies that possesses an aircraft carrier.
The Air Force has about 700 manned aircraft in service.Brazil has not been invaded since 1865 during the Paraguayan War.
Additionally, Brazil has no contested territorial disputes with any of its neighbours and neither does it have rivalries, like Chile and Bolivia have with each other.
Since 1648 the Brazilian Armed Forces have been relied upon to fight in defense of Brazilian sovereignty and to suppress civil rebellions.
The Brazilian military has also three times intervened militarily to overthrow the Brazilian government.
It has built a tradition of participating in UN peacekeeping missions such as in Haiti and East Timor.
Where does the Pakistani Government excercise "de facto" jurisdiction.
Pakistan is a federation of four provinces: Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, as well as the Islamabad Capital Territory and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in the northwest, which include the Frontier Regions.
The government of Pakistan exercises "de facto" jurisdiction over the western parts of the disputed Kashmir region, organised into the separate political entities Azad Kashmir and Gilgit–Baltistan (formerly Northern Areas).
The "Gilgit–Baltistan Empowerment and Self-Governance Order" of 2009 assigned a province-like status to the latter, giving it self-government.Local government follows a three-tier system of districts, tehsils and union councils, with an elected body at each tier.
There are about 130 districts altogether, of which Azad Kashmir has ten and Gilgit–Baltistan seven.
The Tribal Areas comprise seven tribal agencies and six small frontier regions detached from neighbouring districts.Law enforcement in Pakistan is carried out by federal and provincial police agencies.
The four provinces and the Islamabad Capital Territory each have a civilian police force with jurisdiction limited to the relevant province or territory.
At the federal level, there are a number of civilian agencies with nationwide jurisdictions; including the Federal Investigation Agency, the National Highways and Motorway Police, and several paramilitary forces such as the Pakistan Rangers and the Frontier Corps.The court system of Pakistan is organised as a hierarchy, with the Supreme Court at the apex, below which are High Courts, Federal Shariat Courts (one in each province and one in the federal capital), District Courts (one in each district), Judicial Magistrate Courts (in every town and city), Executive Magistrate Courts and Civil Courts.
Pakistan's penal code has limited jurisdiction in the Tribal Areas, where law is largely derived from tribal customs.
How much was stolen from Nigeria's treasury between 1960-1999?
Nigeria is home to a substantial network of organised crime, active especially in drug trafficking.Nigerian criminal groups are heavily involved in drug trafficking, shipping heroin from Asian countries to Europe and America; and cocaine from South America to Europe and South Africa.
.The various Nigerian Confraternities or "campus cults" are active in both organised crime and in political violence as well as providing a network of corruption within Nigeria.
As confraternities have extensive connections with political and military figures, they offer excellent alumni networking opportunities.
The Supreme Vikings Confraternity, for example, boasts that twelve members of the Rivers State House of Assembly are cult members.On lower levels of society, there are the "area boys", organised gangs mostly active in Lagos who specialise in mugging and small-scale drug dealing.
According to official statistics, gang violence in Lagos resulted in 273 civilians and 84 policemen killed in the period of August 2000 to May 2001.Internationally, Nigeria is infamous for a form of bank fraud dubbed "419", a type of advance fee fraud (named after Section 419 of the Nigerian Penal Code) along with the "Nigerian scam", a form of confidence trick practised by individuals and criminal syndicates.
These scams involve a complicit Nigerian bank (the laws being set up loosely to allow it) and a scammer who claims to have money he needs to obtain from that bank.
The victim is talked into exchanging bank account information on the premise that the money will be transferred to him, and then he'll get to keep a cut.
In reality, money is taken out instead, and/or large fees (which seem small in comparison with the imaginary wealth he awaits) are deducted.
In 2003, the Nigerian Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (or EFCC) was created, ostensibly to combat this and other forms of organised financial crime.
There is also some piracy in Nigeria, with attacks mainly directed at smaller ships shuttling employees and materials belonging to the oil companies with any involvement in oil exploration in the Niger Delta.
From 1 January 2007 to 29 October 2007, twenty-six pirate attacks were recorded.Nigeria is also pervaded by political corruption.
It is ranked 143 out of 182 countries in Transparency International's 2011 Corruption Perceptions Index.
More than $400 billion was stolen from the treasury by Nigeria's leaders between 1960 and 1999.
What is Bahía de La Concepción known for?
Mexico has been traditionally among the most visited countries in the world according to the World Tourism Organization and it is the most visited country in the Americas, after the United States.
The most notable attractions are the Meso-American ruins, cultural festivals, colonial cities, nature reserves and the beach resorts.
The nation's temperate climate and unique culture – a fusion of the European and the Meso-American – make Mexico an attractive destination.
The peak tourism seasons in the country are during December and the mid-Summer, with brief surges during the week before Easter and Spring break, when many of the beach resort sites become popular destinations for college students from the United States.Mexico has the 23rd highest income from tourism in the world, and the highest in Latin America.
The vast majority of tourists come to Mexico from the United States and Canada followed by Europe and Asia.
A smaller number also come from other Latin American countries.
In the 2011 Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index report, Mexico was ranked 43rd in the world, which was 4th in the Americas .The coastlines of Mexico harbor many stretches of beaches that are frequented by sun bathers and other visitors.
On the Yucatán peninsula, one of the most popular beach destinations is the resort town of Cancún, especially among university students during spring break.
Just offshore is the beach island of Isla Mujeres, and to the east is the Isla Holbox.
To the south of Cancun is the coastal strip called Riviera Maya which includes the beach town of Playa del Carmen and the ecological parks of Xcaret and Xel-Há.
A day trip to the south of Cancún is the historic port of Tulum.
In addition to its beaches, the town of Tulum is notable for its cliff-side Mayan ruins.On the Pacific coast is the notable tourist destination of Acapulco.
Once the destination for the rich and famous, the beaches have become crowded and the shores are now home to many multi-story hotels and vendors.
Acapulco is home to renowned cliff divers: trained divers who leap from the side of a vertical cliff into the surf below.At the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula is the resort town of Cabo San Lucas, a town noted for its beaches and marlin fishing.
Further north along the Sea of Cortés is the Bahía de La Concepción, another beach town known for its sports fishing.
Closer to the United States border is the weekend draw of San Felipe, Baja California.
what dynasty can the name vietnam be traced back to?
The name "Việt Nam" () is a variation of "Nam Việt" (; literally "Southern Việt"), a name that can be traced back to the Triệu Dynasty of the 2nd century BC.
The word "Việt" originated as a shortened form of Bách Việt (), a word applied to a group of peoples then living in southern China and Vietnam.
The form "Vietnam" () is first recorded in the 16th-century oracular poem "Sấm Trạng Trình".
The name has also been found on 12 steles carved in the 16th and 17th centuries, including one at Bao Lam Pagoda in Haiphong that dates to 1558.Between 1804 and 1813, the name was used officially by Emperor Gia Long.
It was revived in the early 20th century by Phan Bội Châu's "History of the Loss of Vietnam", and later by the Vietnamese Nationalist Party.
The country was usually called Annam until 1945, when both the imperial government in Huế and the Viet Minh government in Hanoi adopted "Việt Nam".
Since the use of Chinese characters was discontinued in 1918, the alphabetic spelling of Vietnam is official.

Where is the hypothetical center from which the Indo-European languages radiated?
History.Prehistory of Anatolia and Eastern Thrace.The Anatolian peninsula, comprising most of modern Turkey, is one of the oldest permanently settled regions in the world.
Various Ancient Anatolian populations have lived in Anatolia, beginning with the Neolithic period until conquest of Alexander the Great.
Many of these peoples spoke the Anatolian languages, a branch of the larger Indo-European language family.
In fact, given the antiquity of the Indo-European Hittite and Luwian languages, some scholars have proposed Anatolia as the hypothetical center from which the Indo-European languages radiated.
European part of Turkey, called Eastern Thrace, has also been inhabited since forty thousand years ago, and is known to have been in the Neolithic era by about 6000 B.C.
with its inhabitants starting the practice of agriculture.Göbekli Tepe is the site of the oldest known man-made religious structure, a temple dating to 10,000 BC, while Çatalhöyük is a very large Neolithic and Chalcolithic settlement in southern Anatolia, which existed from approximately 7500 BCE to 5700 BCE.
It is the largest and best-preserved Neolithic site found to date and in July 2012 was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The settlement of Troy started in the Neolithic Age and continued into the Iron Age.The earliest recorded inhabitants of Anatolia were the Hattians and Hurrians, non-Indo-European peoples who inhabited central and eastern Anatolia, respectively, as early as ca.
2300 BC.
Indo-European Hittites came to Anatolia and gradually absorbed the Hattians and Hurrians ca.
2000–1700 BC.
The first major empire in the area was founded by the Hittites, from the eighteenth through the 13th century BC.
The Assyrians conquered and settled parts of southeastern Turkey as early as 1950 BC until the year 612 BC.Following the collapse of the Hittite empire c. 1180 BC, the Phrygians, an Indo-European people, achieved ascendancy in Anatolia until their kingdom was destroyed by the Cimmerians in the 7th century BC.
The most powerful of Phrygia's successor states were Lydia, Caria and Lycia.
What is Germany's 1949 constitutional document known as?
Germany is a federal, parliamentary, representative democratic republic.
The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 constitutional document known as the "Grundgesetz" (Basic Law).
Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both chambers of parliament; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, and the rule of law are valid in perpetuity.The president is the head of state and invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers.
He is elected by the "Bundesversammlung" (federal convention), an institution consisting of the members of the "Bundestag" and an equal number of state delegates.
The second-highest official in the German order of precedence is the "Bundestagspräsident" (President of the "Bundestag"), who is elected by the "Bundestag" and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body.The third-highest official and the head of government is the Chancellor, who is appointed by the "Bundespräsident" after being elected by the "Bundestag".
The chancellor, currently Angela Merkel, is the head of government and exercises executive power, similar to the role of a Prime Minister in other parliamentary democracies.Federal legislative power is vested in the parliament consisting of the "Bundestag" (Federal Diet) and "Bundesrat" (Federal Council), which together form the legislative body.
The "Bundestag" is elected through direct elections, by proportional representation (mixed-member).
The members of the "Bundesrat" represent the governments of the sixteen federated states and are members of the state cabinets.Since 1949, the party system has been dominated by the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party of Germany.
So far every chancellor has been a member of one of these parties.
However, the smaller liberal Free Democratic Party (which had members in the Bundestag from 1949 to 2013) and the Alliance '90/The Greens (which has had seats in parliament since 1983) have also played important roles.Minor parties such as The Left, Free Voters and the Pirate Party are represented in some state parliaments.
Where is Muay thai native to?
Muay Thai (Thai: มวยไทย, RTGS: Muai Thai, , lit.
"Thai boxing") is a native form of kickboxing and Thailand's national sport.
It incorporates kicks, punches, knees and elbow strikes in a ring with gloves similar to those used in Western boxing and this has led to Thailand gaining medals at the Olympic Games in boxing.Takraw (Thai: ตะกร้อ) is a sport native to Thailand, which the players hit a rattan ball and only be allowed to use their feet, knees, chest and head to touch the ball.
Sepak takraw is a form of this sport which appears in volleyball style, the players must volley a ball over a net and force it to hit the ground on opponent's side.
It is a popular in other countries in Southeast Asia also.
A rather similar game but played only with the feet is Buka ball.Rugby is also a growing sport in Thailand with the Thailand national rugby union team rising to be ranked 61st in the world.
Thailand became the first country in the world to host an international 80 kg welterweight rugby tournament in 2005.
The national domestic Thailand Rugby Union (TRU) competition includes several universities and services teams such as Chulalongkorn University, Mahasarakham University, Kasetsart University, Prince of Songkla University, Thammasat University, Rangsit University, the Thai Police, the Thai Army, the Thai Navy and the Royal Thai Air Force.
Local sports clubs which also compete in the TRU include the British Club of Bangkok, the Southerners Sports Club (Bangkok) and the Royal Bangkok Sports Club.Thailand has been called the Golf Capital of Asia as it is a popular destination for golf.
The country attracts a large number of golfers from Japan, Korea, Singapore, South Africa and Western countries who come to play golf in Thailand every year.
The growing popularity of golf, especially among the middle classes and expats, is evident since there are more than 200 world-class golf courses nationwide, and some of them are chosen to host PGA and LPGA tournaments, such as Amata Spring Country Club, Alpine Golf & Sports Club, Thai Country Club and Black Mountain Golf Club.Basketball is also a growing sport in Thailand, especially on the professional sports club level.
The Chang Thailand Slammers won the 2011 Asean Basketball League Championship.
The Thailand national basketball team had its most successful year at the 1966 Asian Games where it won the silver medal.Other sports in Thailand are slowly growing as the country develops its sporting infrastructure.
The success in sports like weightlifting and Taekwondo at the last two Summer Olympic Games has demonstrated that boxing is no longer the only medal chance for Thailand.

What is included in the unified Canadian Forces?
Canada currently employs a professional, volunteer military force of 68,250 active personnel and approximately 47,081 reserve personnel.
The unified Canadian Forces (CF) comprise the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Navy, and Royal Canadian Air Force.
In 2011, Canada's military expenditure totalled approximately C$24.5 billion.Canada and the United States share the world's longest undefended border, co-operate on military campaigns and exercises, and are each other's largest trading partner.
Canada nevertheless has an independent foreign policy, most notably maintaining full relations with Cuba and declining to officially participate in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
Canada also maintains historic ties to the United Kingdom and France and to other former British and French colonies through Canada's membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and the Francophonie.
Canada is noted for having a positive relationship with the Netherlands, owing, in part, to its contribution to the Dutch liberation during World War II.Canada's strong attachment to the British Empire and Commonwealth led to major participation in British military efforts in the Second Boer War, World War I and World War II.
Since then, Canada has been an advocate for multilateralism, making efforts to resolve global issues in collaboration with other nations.
Canada was a founding member of the United Nations in 1945 and of NATO in 1949.
During the Cold War, Canada was a major contributor to UN forces in the Korean War and founded the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) in co-operation with the United States to defend against potential aerial attacks from the Soviet Union.During the Suez Crisis of 1956, future Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson eased tensions by proposing the inception of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, for which he was awarded the 1957 Nobel Peace Prize.
As this was the first UN peacekeeping mission, Pearson is often credited as the inventor of the concept.
Canada has since served in 50 peacekeeping missions, including every UN peacekeeping effort until 1989, and has since maintained forces in international missions in Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, and elsewhere; Canada has sometimes faced controversy over its involvement in foreign countries, notably in the 1993 Somalia Affair.Canada joined the Organization of American States (OAS) in 1990 and hosted the OAS General Assembly in Windsor, Ontario, in June 2000 and the third Summit of the Americas in Quebec City in April 2001.
Canada seeks to expand its ties to Pacific Rim economies through membership in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC).In 2001, Canada deployed troops to Afghanistan as part of the US stabilization force and the UN-authorized, NATO-led International Security Assistance Force.
In all, Canada lost 158 soldiers, one diplomat, two aid workers, and one journalist during the ten year mission, which cost approximately C$11.3 billion.In February 2007, Canada, Italy, the United Kingdom, Norway, and Russia announced their joint commitment to a $1.5-billion project to help develop vaccines for developing nations, and called on other countries to join them.
In August 2007, Canada's territorial claims in the Arctic were challenged after a Russian underwater expedition to the North Pole; Canada has considered that area to be sovereign territory since 1925.
Between March and October 2011, Canadian forces participated in a UN-mandated NATO intervention into the 2011 Libyan civil war.
When did the First World War begin?
The earliest recorded examples of a vernacular Romance-based literature date from the same time and location, the rich mix of Muslim, Jewish, and Christian cultures in Muslim Spain, in which Maimonides, Averroes, and others worked, The Jarchas.During the Reconquista, the epic poem Cantar de Mio Cid was written about a real man—his battles, conquests, and daily life.Other major plays from the medival times were Mester de Juglaría, Mester de Clerecía, Coplas por la muerte de su padre or The Book of Good Love.During the Renaissance the major plays are La Celestina and El Lazarillo de Tormes, while many religious literature was created with poets as Luis de León, San Juan de la Cruz, Santa Teresa de Jesús, etc.The Baroque is the most important period for Spanish culture.
We are in the times of the Spanish Empire.
The famous Don Quijote de La Mancha by Miguel de Cervantes was written in this time.
Other writers from the period are: Francisco de Quevedo, Lope de Vega, Calderón de la Barca or Tirso de Molina.During the Enlightenment we find names as Leandro Fernández de Moratín, Benito Jerónimo Feijóo, Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos or Leandro Fernández de Moratín.During the Romanticism, José Zorrilla created one of the most emblematic figures in European literature in Don Juan Tenorio.
Other writers from this period are Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer, José de Espronceda, Rosalía de Castro or Mariano José de Larra.in the Realism we find names as Benito Pérez Galdós, Emilia Pardo Bazán, Leopoldo Alas (Clarín) or Vicente Blasco Ibáñez and Menéndez Pelayo.
Realism offered depictions of contemporary life and society 'as they were'.
In the spirit of general "Realism," Realist authors opted for depictions of everyday and banal activities and experiences, instead of a romanticized or similarly stylized presentation.The Generation of 1898 The destruction of Spain's fleet in Cuba by U.S. gunboats in 1898 provoked a general cultural crisis in Spain.
The "Disaster" of 1898 led established writers to seek practical political, economic, and social solutions in essays grouped under the literary heading of "Regeneracionismo."
For a group of younger writers, among them Miguel de Unamuno, Pío Baroja, and José Martínez Ruiz (Azorín), the Disaster and its cultural repercussions inspired a deeper, more radical literary shift that affected both form and content.
These writers, along with Ramón del Valle-Inclán, Antonio Machado, Ramiro de Maeztu, and Ángel Ganivet, came to be known as the 'Generation of 98.
'The Generation of 1914 or Novecentismo The next supposed “generation” of Spanish writers following those of ´98 already calls into question the value of such terminology.
By the year 1914—the year of the outbreak of the First World War and of the publication of the first major work of the generation's leading voice, José Ortega y Gasset—a number of slightly younger writers had established their own place within the Spanish cultural field.
Leading voices include the poet Juan Ramón Jiménez, the academics and essayists Ramón Menéndez Pidal, Gregorio Marañon, Manuel Azaña, Eugeni d'Ors, and Ortega y Gasset, and the novelists Gabriel Miró, Ramón Pérez de Ayala, and Ramón Gómez de la Serna.
While still driven by the national and existential questions that obsessed the writers of ´98, they approached these topics with a greater sense of distance and objectivity.The Generation of 1927, where poets Pedro Salinas, Jorge Guillén, Federico García Lorca, Vicente Aleixandre, Dámaso Alonso.
All were scholars of their national literary heritage, again evidence of the impact of the calls of “Regeneracionistas” and the Generation of 1898 for Spanish intelligence to turn at least partially inwards.The two main writers in the second half of the 20th century were the Nobel Prize in Literature laureate Camilo José Cela and Miguel Delibes.
Spain is one of the countries with the most number of laureates with the Nobel Prize in Literature, and with latinamerican laureates they made the spanish language literature one of the most laureates of all.
The spanish writers are: José Echegaray, Jacinto Benavente, Juan Ramón Jiménez, Vicente Aleixandre and Camilo José Cela.
The Portuguese writer José Saramago, also awarded with the prize, lived for many years in Spain and was Portuguese and spanish speaker.
He also was well known by his iberist ideas.
what award did lord of the rings win in 2009
While early reviews for The Lord of the Rings were mixed, reviews in various media have been, on the whole, highly positive and acknowledge Tolkien's literary achievement as a significant one.
On its initial review the "Sunday Telegraph" felt it was "among the greatest works of imaginative fiction of the twentieth century."
The "Sunday Times" seemed to echo these sentiments when in its review it was stated that "the English-speaking world is divided into those who have read "The Lord of the Rings" and "The Hobbit" and those who are going to read them."
The "New York Herald Tribune" also seemed to have an idea of how popular the books would become, writing in its review that they were "destined to outlast our time."
W. H. Auden, an admirer of Tolkien's writings, regarded "The Lord of the Rings" as a "masterpiece", further stating that in some cases it outdid the achievement of John Milton's "Paradise Lost".
"New York Times" reviewer Judith Shulevitz criticized the "pedantry" of Tolkien's literary style, saying that he "formulated a high-minded belief in the importance of his mission as a literary preservationist, which turns out to be death to literature itself."
Critic Richard Jenkyns, writing in "The New Republic", criticized the work for a lack of psychological depth.
Both the characters and the work itself are, according to Jenkyns, "anemic, and lacking in fibre."
Even within Tolkien's literary group, The Inklings, reviews were mixed.
Hugo Dyson complained loudly at its readings.
However, another Inkling, C. S. Lewis, had very different feelings, writing, "here are beauties which pierce like swords or burn like cold iron.
Here is a book which will break your heart."
Despite these reviews and its lack of paperback printing until the 1960s, "The Lord of the Rings" initially sold well in hardback.In 1957, "The Lord of the Rings" was awarded the International Fantasy Award.
Despite its numerous detractors, the publication of the Ace Books and Ballantine paperbacks helped "The Lord of the Rings" become immensely popular in the United States in the 1960s.
The book has remained so ever since, ranking as one of the most popular works of fiction of the twentieth century, judged by both sales and reader surveys.
In the 2003 "Big Read" survey conducted in Britain by the BBC, "The Lord of the Rings" was found to be the "Nation's best-loved book."
In similar 2004 polls both Germany and Australia also found "The Lord of the Rings" to be their favourite book.
In a 1999 poll of Amazon.com customers, "The Lord of the Rings" was judged to be their favourite "book of the millennium."
"The Lord of the Rings" was awarded the Prometheus Hall of Fame Award in 2009.
When was the soundtrack for 'The Terminator' released?
After production finished on "The Terminator", some post-production shots were needed.
These included scenes showing the Terminator outside Sarah Connor's apartment, Reese being zipped into a body bag, and the Terminator's head being crushed in a press.
The film's soundtrack was synthesizer music composed by Brad Fiedel.
Fiedel described the film's music as being about "a mechanical man and his heartbeat".
Almost all the music in the film was performed live.
"The Terminator"s theme is played over the opening credits and is played in various points in the film in sped up versions: a slowed down version when Reese dies, and a piano version during the love scene.
Fiedel created music for when Reese and Connor escape from the police station that would be appropriate for a "heroic moment".
Cameron turned down this theme, as he believed it would lose the audience's excitement.
The soundtrack to the film was released in 1984.
What was the original title of Terminator Salvation?
McG signed on to direct as the first two films were among his favorites, and he had even cast Robert Patrick (who played the T-1000) in his films.
Though he was initially unsure about "flogging a dead horse," he felt the post-apocalyptic setting allowed the film to be different enough so as not to be just an inferior sequel.
The idea that events in ' and ' altered the future also allowed them to be flexible with their presentation of the futuristic world.
McG met with the series' co-creator James Cameron, and, although he neither blessed nor denigrated the project, Cameron told the new director he had faced a similar challenge when following Ridley Scott's "Alien" with "Aliens".
He maintained two elements of the previous films; that John is an outsider to the authorities, and someone of future importance is being protected, and in this film it is Kyle Reese.The first full screenplay for the film was written by "" writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris, who received full screenplay credit.
Paul Haggis rewrote Brancato and Ferris's script, and Shawn Ryan made another revision three weeks before filming.
Jonathan Nolan also wrote on set, which led to McG characterizing his work on the script as the most important; he chose to contribute to the film after Bale signed on and created Connor's arc of becoming a leader.
Anthony E. Zuiker contributed to the script as well.
So extensive were the rewrites that Alan Dean Foster decided to rewrite the entire novelization after submitting it to his publisher, because the compiled shooting script was very different from the one he was given beforehand.In the early script drafts, John was a secondary character.
Producer James Middleton explained """ was influenced by Jesus Christ, but it was his story.
Much in that way, this main character will be influenced by John Connor."
The original ending was to have John killed, and his image kept alive by the resistance by grafting his skin onto Marcus' cybernetic body.
However, after the ending was leaked on the Internet, Warner Bros. decided to completely change the entire third act of the film.
McG and Nolan did continue the Christ element of John's character though, in which he has some followers who believe what he knows about Skynet, and others who do not.McG described the film's theme as "where you draw the line between machines and humans".
The friendship between Marcus — who was executed (for murder) when humanity still ruled the world — and Kyle Reese illustrates how war and suffering can bring out the best in people, such as when they worked together to survive during the Blitz.
The title was derived from this second chance given to humanity and to Marcus, in addition to John's efforts to save humanity from the machines.
The film's original title was "Terminator Salvation: The Future Begins", but this was dropped during filming.Throughout writing, the cast and crew would watch scenes from the three films to pick moments to reference or tribute, including "Come with me if you want to live" and "I'll be back", which is uttered by John in this film.
McG found himself having to decide which ideas for references would be included and which would not.
An opening scene has John fighting a Terminator on a crashed helicopter, which was storyboarded as a homage to the climax of the original film, where his mother Sarah, having broken her leg, is chased by a crippled Terminator.
McG did this to reflect the skills John learned from her.

What year was Toy Story released?
Toy Story is a 1995 American computer-animated buddy-comedy adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and directed by John Lasseter, released by Walt Disney Pictures, "Toy Story" was the first feature-length computer-animated film and the first film produced by Pixar.
"Toy Story" follows a group of anthropomorphic toys who pretend to be lifeless whenever humans are present, and focuses on the relationship between Woody, a pullstring cowboy doll (Tom Hanks), and Buzz Lightyear, an astronaut action figure (Tim Allen).
The film was written by John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen, Alec Sokolow, and Joss Whedon, and featured music by Randy Newman.
Its executive producers were Steve Jobs and Edwin Catmull.Pixar, which produced short animated films to promote their computers, was approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature after the success of the short "Tin Toy" (1988), which is told from a small toy's perspective.
Lasseter, Stanton, and Pete Docter wrote early story treatments which were thrown out by Disney, who pushed for a more edgy film.
After disastrous story reels, production was halted and the script was re-written, better reflecting the tone and theme Pixar desired: that "toys deeply want children to play with them, and that this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions."
The studio, then consisting of a relatively small number of employees, produced the film under minor financial constraints.The top-grossing film on its opening weekend, "Toy Story" went on to earn over $361 million worldwide.
Reviews were entirely positive, praising both the animation's technical innovation and the screenplay's wit and sophistication, and it is now widely considered by many critics to be one of the best animated films ever made.
In addition to home media releases and theatrical re-releases, "Toy Story"-inspired material has run the gamut from toys, video games, theme park attractions, spin-offs, merchandise, and two sequels—"Toy Story 2" (1999) and "Toy Story 3" (2010)—both of which received massive commercial success and critical acclaim.
"Toy Story" was inducted into the National Film Registry as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" in 2005, its first year of eligibility.
When was "Kung Fu Panda 2" released?
Kung Fu Panda is a 2008 American computer-animated action comedy wuxia film produced by DreamWorks Animation and distributed by Paramount Pictures.

When an evil kung fu warrior is foretold to escape from prison, Po is unwittingly named the chosen one destined to bring peace to the land, much to the chagrin of the resident kung fu warriors.The idea for the film was conceived by Michael Lachance, a DreamWorks Animation executive.
The film was originally intended to be a parody, but director Stevenson decided instead to shoot an action comedy wuxia film that incorporates the hero's journey narrative archetype for the lead character.
The computer animation in the film was more complex than anything DreamWorks had done before.
As with most DreamWorks animated films, Hans Zimmer (collaborating with John Powell this time) scored "Kung Fu Panda".
He visited China to absorb the culture and get to know the China National Symphony Orchestra as part of his preparation.
A sequel, "Kung Fu Panda 2", was released on May 26, 2011, along with a television series, "" later that same year as a part of a franchise.

How did "Total Film" rank "Fight Club"?
"Fight Club" was one of the most controversial and talked-about films of the 1990s.
Like other 1999 films "Magnolia", "Being John Malkovich", and "Three Kings", "Fight Club" was recognized as an innovator in cinematic form and style since it exploited new developments in filmmaking technology.
After "Fight Club"s theatrical release, it became more popular via word of mouth, and the positive reception of the DVD established it as a cult film that David Ansen of "Newsweek" conjectured would enjoy "perennial" fame.
The film's success also heightened the profile of the novel's author, Chuck Palahniuk, to global renown.Following "Fight Club"s release, several fight clubs were reported to have started in the United States.
A "Gentleman's Fight Club" was started in Menlo Park, California in 2000 and had members mostly from the tech industry.
Teens and preteens in Texas, New Jersey, Washington state, and Alaska also initiated fight clubs and posted videos of their fights online, leading authorities to break up the clubs.
In 2006, an unwilling participant from a local high school was injured at a fight club in Arlington, Texas, and the DVD sales of the fight led to the arrest of six teenagers.
An unsanctioned fight club was also started at Princeton University, where matches were held on campus.
The film was suspected of influencing Luke Helder, a college student who planted pipe bombs in mailboxes in 2002.
Helder's goal was to create a smiley pattern on the map of the United States, similar to the scene in "Fight Club" in which a building is vandalized to have a smiley on its exterior.
On July 16, 2009, a 17-year-old who had formed his own fight club in Manhattan was charged with detonating a homemade bomb outside a Starbucks Coffee shop in the Upper East Side in May 2009; the New York City Police Department reported the suspect was trying to emulate "Project Mayhem".In 2003, "Fight Club" was listed as one of the "50 Best Guy Movies of All Time" by "Men's Journal".
In 2004 and 2006, "Fight Club" was voted by "Empire" readers as the ninth and eighth greatest film of all time, respectively.
"Total Film" ranked "Fight Club" as "The Greatest Film of our Lifetime" in 2007 during the magazine's tenth anniversary.
In 2007, "Premiere" selected Tyler Durden's line, "The first rule of fight club is you do not talk about fight club," as the 27th greatest movie line of all time.
In 2008, readers of "Empire" ranked Tyler Durden first on a list of the 100 Greatest Movie Characters.
"Empire" also identified "Fight Club" as the 10th greatest movie of all time in its 2008 issue "The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time".In 2010, two viral mash-up videos featuring "Fight Club" were released.
"Ferris Club" was a mash-up of "Fight Club" and the film "Ferris Bueller's Day Off".
It portrayed Ferris as Tyler Durden and Cameron as the narrator, "claiming to see the real psychological truth behind the John Hughes classic".
The second video "Jane Austen's Fight Club" also gained popularity online as a mash-up of "Fight Club"s fighting rules and the characters created by 19th century novelist Jane Austen.
The feather is stored in what favorite book by Forrest?
Symbolism.Feather.Various interpretations have been suggested for the feather present at the opening and conclusion of the film.
Sarah Lyall of "The New York Times" noted several opinions that were made about the feather: "Does the white feather symbolize the unbearable lightness of being?
Forrest Gump's impaired intellect?
The randomness of experience?"
Hanks interpreted the feather as: "Our destiny is only defined by how we deal with the chance elements to our life and that's kind of the embodiment of the feather as it comes in.
Here is this thing that can land anywhere and that it lands at your feet.
It has theological implications that are really huge."
Sally Field compared the feather to fate, saying: "It blows in the wind and just touches down here or there.
Was it planned or was it just perchance?"
Visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston compared the feather to an abstract painting: "It can mean so many things to so many different people.
"The feather is stored in a book titled "Curious George", Forrest's favorite book, which his mother read to him, connecting the scene's present time with his childhood in the 1940s.
The placement of the feather in the book is directly on a picture of the monkey walking on a tightrope.
Whether that was intentional or not, it is very symbolic.
The feather also has a correlation with Jenny's constant obsession with "becoming a bird and flying far far away" due to the abuse (sexual and physical) she endured from her father.
She goes as far in the film as to ask Forrest "if jumped off the bridge, could [she fly?"
Who created the sound effects in the film The Matrix?
Dane A. Davis was responsible for creating the sound effects for the film.
The fight scenes sound effects, such as the whipping sounds of punches, came from using junk to create noises and capturing them, then editing the sounds.
The sound of the pod containing a human baby closing required almost fifty sounds put together.The film's score was composed by Don Davis.
He noted that mirrors appear frequently in the film: reflections of the blue and red pills are seen in Morpheus's glasses; Neo's capture by Agents is viewed through the rear-view mirror of Trinity's Triumph Speed Triple motorcycle; Neo observes a broken mirror mending itself; reflections warp as a spoon is bent; the reflection of a helicopter is visible as it approaches a skyscraper.
Davis focused on this theme of reflections when creating his score, alternating between sections of the orchestra and attempting to incorporate contrapuntal ideas.
Davis' score combines orchestral, choral and synthesizer elements; the balance between these elements varies depending on whether humans or machines are the dominant subject of a given scene.In addition to Davis' score, "The Matrix" soundtrack also features music from acts such as Rammstein, Rob Dougan, Rage Against the Machine, Propellerheads, Ministry, Deftones, Monster Magnet, The Prodigy, Rob Zombie, Meat Beat Manifesto, and Marilyn Manson.
What was the occupation of the person who asked a question about bringing together five felons?
Production.Origins.Bryan Singer met Kevin Spacey at a party after a screening of the young filmmaker's first film, "Public Access", at the 1993 Sundance Film Festival.
Spacey had been encouraged by a number of people he knew who had seen it, and was so impressed that he told Singer and McQuarrie that he wanted to be in whatever film they did next.
Singer read a column in "Spy" magazine called "The Usual Suspects" after Claude Rains' line in "Casablanca."
Singer thought that it would be a good title for a film.
When asked by a reporter at Sundance what their next film was about, McQuarrie replied, "I guess it's about a bunch of criminals who meet in a police line-up," which incidentally was the first visual idea that he and Singer had for the poster: "five guys who meet in a line-up," Singer remembers.
The director also envisioned a tagline for the poster, "All of you can go to Hell."
Singer then asked the question, "What would possibly bring these five felons together in one line-up?"
McQuarrie revamped an idea from one of his own unpublished screenplays — the story of a man who murders his own family and walks away, disappearing from view.
The writer mixed this with the idea of a team of criminals.Söze's character is based on the accounts of John List, a New Jersey accountant who murdered his family in 1971 and then disappeared for almost two decades, assuming a new identity before he was ultimately apprehended.
McQuarrie based the name of Keyser Söze on one of his previous supervisors, Keyser Sume, at a Los Angeles law firm that he worked for, but decided to change the last name because he thought that his former boss would object to how it was used.
He found the word "söze" in his roommate's English-to-Turkish dictionary, which translates as "talk too much."
All the characters' names are taken from staff members of the law firm at the time of his employment.
McQuarrie had also worked for a detective agency, and this influenced the depiction of criminals and law enforcement officials in the script.Singer described the film as "Double Indemnity" meets "Rashomon," and said that it was made "so you can go back and see all sorts of things you didn't realize were there the first time.
You can get it a second time in a way you never could have the first time around."
He also compared the film's structure to "Citizen Kane" (which also contained an interrogator and a subject who is telling a story) and the criminal caper "The Anderson Tapes."
When was the Lion King released?
The Lion King is a 1994 American animated musical adventure film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures.
It is the 32nd animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series.
The story takes place in a kingdom of lions in Africa, and was influenced by the biblical tales of Joseph and Moses and the Shakespeare play "Hamlet".
The film was produced during a period known as the Disney Renaissance.
"The Lion King" was directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff, produced by Don Hahn, and has a screenplay credited to Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts and Linda Woolverton.
The film features a large ensemble voice cast led by Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Moira Kelly.
It tells the story of Simba, a young lion who is to succeed his father, Mufasa, as king; however, after Simba's uncle Scar murders Mufasa, Simba is fooled into thinking he was responsible and flees into exile in shame and despair.
Upon maturation living with two wastrels, Simba is given some valuable perspective from his friend, Nala, and his shaman, Rafiki, before returning to challenge Scar to end his tyranny.Development of "The Lion King" began in 1988 during a meeting between Jeffrey Katzenberg, Roy E. Disney and Peter Schneider while promoting "Oliver & Company" in Europe.
Thomas Disch wrote a film treatment, and Woolverton developed the first scripts while George Scribner was signed on as director, being later joined by Allers.
Production began in 1991, with most of the animators inexperienced or uninterested in animals as most of the Disney team wanted to work on "Pocahontas" instead.
Some time after the staff traveled to Hell's Gate National Park to research on the film's setting and animals, Scribner left production disagreeing with the decision to turn the film into a musical, and was replaced by Minkoff.
When Hahn joined the project, he was dissatisfied with the script and the story was promptly rewritten.
Nearly 20 minutes of animation sequences took place at Disney-MGM Studios in Florida.
Computer animation was also used in several scenes, most notably in the wildebeest stampede scene.
"The Lion King" was released on June 15, 1994 to a positive reaction from critics, who praised the film for its music and story.
Following a 3D re-release in 2011, with earnings of over US$987 million worldwide as of 2011, the film is the highest-grossing hand-drawn film in history, the highest-grossing 2D animated film in the United States and the 19th-highest-grossing feature film of all time.
"The Lion King" garnered two Academy Awards for its achievement in music and the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.
Its songs were written by composer Elton John and lyricist Tim Rice, with an original score by Hans Zimmer.
The film lead to many derived works, such as a Broadway adaptation, two direct-to-video follow-ups - sequel "" (1998) and the prequel/parallel "The Lion King 1½" (2004) - and spin-off series "Timon and Pumbaa".
Have some fans threatened violence against critics?
"The Dark Knight Rises" received mostly positive reviews from critics; Rotten Tomatoes sampled 304 reviewers and judged 88% of the reviews to be positive.
Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 78 (out of 100) based on 45 reviews from mainstream critics, considered to be "generally favorable reviews".
CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film an A grade.
"The Telegraph" granted the film a maximum score of five stars, stating that it is "a superhero film without a superhero," comparing it with "The Godfather Part II" and praising Hardy's performance as well as the film's intricate plot and narrative.
Kenneth Turan of the "Los Angeles Times" thought the film was "potent, persuasive and hypnotic" and that it was "more than an exceptional superhero movie, it is masterful filmmaking by any standard."
"The Playlists" Todd Gilchrist wrote "A cinematic, cultural and personal triumph, "The Dark Knight Rises" is emotionally inspiring, aesthetically significant and critically important for America itself – as a mirror of both sober reflection and resilient hope."
IGN gave it a 9 out of 10, noting similarities in tone and theme to "Batman Begins" over the trilogy's second installment "The Dark Knight", but also describing Bane as "that bit less interesting to watch" than Ledger's Joker, despite praising his "menacing voice" and "body language-driven performance".
"The Guardian" scored the film four out of five stars, calling it a film of "granite, monolithic intensity", yet also calling it a "hammy, portentous affair".
Andrew O'Hehir of "Salon" writes "if "The Dark Knight Rises" is a fascist film, it's a great fascist film, and arguably the biggest, darkest, most thrilling and disturbing and utterly balls-out spectacle ever created for the screen".
Roger Ebert of the "Chicago Sun-Times" gave the film three out of four stars, stating "the film begins slowly with a murky plot and too many new characters, but builds to a sensational climax."
Film critic Richard Roeper gave the film an "A", calling it "a majestic, gorgeous, brutal and richly satisfying epic", and citing the final scenes of the picture as "the best five minutes of any film this year."
The London Film Review gave the film a B and said "Nolan's film is a reminder that superheroes aren't merely a frivolous distraction, but an embodiment of our best selves."
The film was crowned by "Forbes" as the best modern comic book superhero adaption on screen, outranking both its main summer blockbuster competitor, "Marvel's The Avengers", and the trilogy's previous installment "The Dark Knight".
"The Daily Mail" Chris Tookey said that the film was bloated and overly long, and criticized the sombre tone and lack of humor, despite praising the film's visually-impressive set pieces.
CNN's Tom Charity said the film was a "disappointingly clunky and bombastic conclusion to a superior series" and called it Nolan's worst film.
Anthony Lane of "The New Yorker" says that the "story is dense, overlong, and studded with references that will make sense only to those intimate with Nolan's previous excursions into Batmanhood".In reaction to fan backlash to some of the negative reviews, Rotten Tomatoes chose to disable user commentary for the film leading up to its release.
Some fans had threatened violence against critics while others threatened to take down the websites of movie critics who had given the film a negative review.
When was the film review published?
Even though impressed by the technological accuracy of the film's set-design and port construction buildings, novelist Lothar-Günter Buchheim expressed great disappointment with Petersen's adaptation in a film review published in 1981, especially with Petersen's aesthetic vision for the film and the way the plot and the effects are, according to him, overdone and clichéd by the adaptation.
He also criticised the hysterical overacting of the cast, which he called highly unrealistic, while acknowledging the cast's acting talent in general.
Buchheim, after several attempts for an American adaptation had failed, had provided a script detailing his own narrative, cinematographical and photographical ideas as soon as Petersen was chosen as new director.
It would have amounted in full to a complete six-hour epic; however, Petersen turned him down because at the time the producers were aiming for a 90-minute feature for international release.
However, today's Director's Cut of "Das Boot" amounts to over 200 minutes, and the complete TV version of the film is 282 minutes long.Buchheim, himself a U-boat correspondent, attacked specifically what he called Petersen's sacrificing of both realism and suspense in dialogue, narration, and photography for the sake of cheap dramatic thrills and action effects (for example, in reality one single exploding bolt of the boat's pressure hull would have been enough for the whole crew to worry about the U-boat being crushed by water pressure, while Petersen has several bolts loosening in various scenes).
Buchheim also criticized depictions of the crew's loud behaviour during patrols as unrealistic and celebrations after achieving a torpedo hit or surviving a bombing as unprofessional.
Furthermore, an officer—even an outsider like Lt. Werner—would have commanded special respect and that throwing an oil-drenched towel into his face would not have been tolerated.Uttering concerns about the end result, Buchheim felt that unlike his clearly anti-war novel the adaptation was "another re-glorification and re-mystification" of the German World War II U-boat war, German heroism and nationalism.
He called the film a cross between a "cheap, shallow American action flick" and a "contemporary German propaganda newsreel from World War II".
Why was Emily Watson's role in Amelie recast?
In his DVD commentary, Jeunet explains that he originally wrote the role of Amélie for the English actress Emily Watson; in the original draft, Amélie's father was an Englishman living in London.
However, Watson's French was not strong, and when she became unavailable to shoot the film, owing to a conflict with the filming of "Gosford Park", Jeunet rewrote the screenplay for a French actress.
Audrey Tautou was the first actress he auditioned having seen her on the poster for "Venus Beauty Institute".The movie was filmed mainly in Paris.
The Café des 2 Moulins (15 Rue Lepic, Montmartre, Paris) where Amélie works is a real place.The filmmakers made use of computer-generated imagery and a digital intermediate.
The studio scenes were filmed in the Coloneum Studio in Cologne (Germany).
The film shares many of the themes in the plot with second half of the 1994 film "Chungking Express".
When does Toy Story 3 premiere?
"Toy Story 3" had its world-wide premiere on June 12, 2010, opening at Taormina Film Fest in Italy.
In the United States, it premiered on June 13, 2010 at El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California.
El Capitan also hosted on June 17, 2010 a "Toy Story" marathon, showing for the first time all three "Toy Story" films together.
The film went into its wide release on June 18, 2010, along with a release to IMAX 3D theaters.The film was theatrically accompanied with the Pixar short film "Day & Night", which focuses on what happens when an animated personification of Day meets his opposite, Night, and the resulting growth for both.
How many Despicable Me movies are there?
Despicable Me is a 2010 American computer-animated 3D comedy film from Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment that was released on July 9, 2010 in the United States.
It is Illumination Entertainment's first film.
It was directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud, based on an original story by Sergio Pablos.The film stars the voice of Steve Carell as Gru, a super-villain who adopts three girls (voiced by Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, and Elsie Fisher) from an orphanage; and the voice of Jason Segel as Vector, a rival of Gru who steals the Great Pyramid of Giza.
When Gru learns of Vector's heist, he plans an even greater heist: to shrink and steal the Earth's moon.It was entirely animated by the French animation studio Mac Guff, which was later acquired by Illumination Entertainment.The film earned positive reviews from critics, and grossed over $543 million worldwide, against a budget of $69 million.
It launched a franchise with a series of films, including a sequel in 2013, followed by a 2015 spin-off film featuring Gru's Minions as the main characters, and "Despicable Me 3" in 2017.
What did Christain Bale win?
Wally Pfister was nominated for Best Cinematography at the 78th Academy Awards, receiving the film's only Academy Award nomination.
The film received three nominations at the 59th British Academy Film Awards.
Just months after its release, "Batman Begins" was voted by "Empire" readers as the 36th greatest film of all time.
In 2006, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers honored James Newton Howard, Hans Zimmer, and Ramin Djawadi with an ASCAP award for composing a film that became one of the top grossing films of 2005.
The film was awarded three Saturn Awards in 2006 as well: Best Fantasy Film, Best Actor for Christian Bale, and Best Writing for Nolan and Goyer.
Christian Bale would go on to win an MTV Movie Award for Best Hero.
However, Katie Holmes's performance was not well received, and she was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress.
"Batman Begins" won the fan-based "Total Film" award for Best Film.In November 2008, "Empire" ranked "Batman Begins" 81 in its 500 Greatest Movies of All Time list.
On what date did Britain declare war on Germany following an "unsatisfactory reply" to the British ultimatum that Belgium must be kept neutral?
The assassination led to a month of diplomatic manoeuvring between Austria-Hungary, Germany, Russia, France, and Britain which was called the July Crisis.
Believing correctly that Serbian officials (especially the officers of the Black Hand) were involved in the plot, and wanting to finally end Serbian interference in Bosnia, Austria-Hungary delivered to Serbia the July Ultimatum, a series of ten demands intentionally made unacceptable, intending to provoke a war with Serbia.
When Serbia agreed to only eight of the ten demands, Austria-Hungary declared war on 28 July 1914.
Strachan argues, "Whether an equivocal and early response by Serbia would have made any difference to Austria-Hungary's behaviour must be doubtful.
Franz Ferdinand was not the sort of personality who commanded popularity, and his demise did not cast the empire into deepest mourning".The Russian Empire, unwilling to allow Austria-Hungary to eliminate its influence in the Balkans, and in support of its longtime Serb protégé, ordered a partial mobilisation one day later, 29 July.
Germany mobilised on 30 July, and Russia responded by declaring a full mobilisation that same day.
Germany imposed an ultimatum on Russia, through its ambassador in Berlin, to demobilise within 12 hours or face war.
Russia responded by offering to negotiate the terms of a demobilisation.
However, Germany refused to negotiate, declaring war against Russia on 1 August 1914.Germany's war plan, the Schlieffen Plan, relied on a quick, massive invasion of France to eliminate the threat on the West, before turning east against Russia.
Simultaneously with its mobilisation against Russia, therefore, the German government issued demands that France remain neutral.
The French cabinet resisted military pressure to commence immediate mobilisation, and ordered its troops to withdraw from the border to avoid any incident.
Germany attacked Luxembourg on 2 August, and on 3 August declared war on France.
On 4 August, after Belgium refused to permit German troops to cross its borders into France, Germany declared war on Belgium as well.
Britain declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914, following an "unsatisfactory reply" to the British ultimatum that Belgium must be kept neutral.
On what date did negotiations take place to determine if the Soviet Union would join the Tripartite Pact?
Axis attack on the USSR (1941).With the situation in Europe and Asia relatively stable, Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union made preparations.
With the Soviets wary of mounting tensions with Germany and the Japanese planning to take advantage of the European War by seizing resource-rich European possessions in Southeast Asia, the two powers signed the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1941.
By contrast, the Germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the Soviet Union, amassing forces on the Soviet border.Hitler believed that Britain's refusal to end the war was based on the hope that the United States and the Soviet Union would enter the war against Germany sooner or later.
He accordingly decided to try to strengthen Germany's relations with the Soviets, or failing that, to attack and eliminate them as a factor.
In November 1940 negotiations took place to determine if the Soviet Union would join the Tripartite Pact.
The Soviets showed some interest, but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan that Germany considered unacceptable.
On 18 December 1940 Hitler issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the Soviet Union.On 22 June 1941, Germany, Italy and Romania invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, with Germany accusing the Soviets of plotting against them.
They were joined shortly by Finland and Hungary.
The primary targets of this surprise offensive were the Baltic region, Moscow and Ukraine, with the ultimate goal of ending the 1941 campaign near the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan line, from the Caspian to the White Seas.
Hitler's objectives were to eliminate the Soviet Union as a military power, exterminate Communism, generate "Lebensraum" ("living space") by dispossessing the native population and guarantee access to the strategic resources needed to defeat Germany's remaining rivals.Although the Red Army was preparing for strategic counter-offensives before the war, "Barbarossa" forced the Soviet supreme command to adopt a strategic defence.
During the summer, the Axis made significant gains into Soviet territory, inflicting immense losses in both personnel and materiel.
By the middle of August, however, the German Army High Command decided to suspend the offensive of a considerably depleted Army Group Centre, and to divert the 2nd Panzer Group to reinforce troops advancing towards central Ukraine and Leningrad.
The Kiev offensive was overwhelmingly successful, resulting in encirclement and elimination of four Soviet armies, and made further advance into Crimea and industrially developed Eastern Ukraine (the First Battle of Kharkov) possible.The diversion of three quarters of the Axis troops and the majority of their air forces from France and the central Mediterranean to the Eastern Front prompted Britain to reconsider its grand strategy.
In July, the UK and the Soviet Union formed a military alliance against Germany The British and Soviets invaded Iran to secure the Persian Corridor and Iran's oil fields.
In August, the United Kingdom and the United States jointly issued the Atlantic Charter.By October, when Axis operational objectives in Ukraine and the Baltic region were achieved, with only the sieges of Leningrad and Sevastopol continuing, a major offensive against Moscow had been renewed.
After two months of fierce battles, the German army almost reached the outer suburbs of Moscow, where the exhausted troops were forced to suspend their offensive.
Large territorial gains were made by Axis forces, but their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives: two key cities remained in Soviet hands, the Soviet capability to resist was not broken, and the Soviet Union retained a considerable part of its military potential.
The "blitzkrieg" phase of the war in Europe had ended.By early December, freshly mobilised reserves allowed the Soviets to achieve numerical parity with Axis troops.
This, as well as intelligence data that established a minimal number of Soviet troops in the East sufficient to prevent any attack by the Japanese Kwantung Army, allowed the Soviets to begin a massive counter-offensive that started on 5 December all along the front and pushed German troops west.
Who remarked that Lincoln looked cheerful the morning of his assassination?
Lincoln's day started well for the first time in a while.
Hugh McCulloch, the new Secretary of the Treasury, remarked that on that morning, "I never saw Mr. Lincoln so cheerful and happy".
No one could miss the difference.
For months, the President had looked pale and haggard.
Lincoln himself told people how happy he was.
This caused First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln some concern, as she believed that saying such things out loud was bad luck.
Lincoln paid her no heed.At around noon, while visiting Ford's Theatre to pick up his mail (Booth had a permanent mailbox there), Booth learned from the brother of John Ford, the owner, that the President and General Grant would be attending the theatre to see "Our American Cousin" that night.
Booth determined that this was the perfect opportunity for him to do something "decisive".
He knew the theater's layout, having performed there several times, as recently as the previous month.That same afternoon, Booth went to Mary Surratt's boarding house in Washington, D.C. and asked her to deliver a package to her tavern in Surrattsville, Maryland.
He also requested Surratt to tell her tenant who resided there to have the guns and ammunition that Booth had previously stored at the tavern ready to be picked up later that evening.
She complied with Booth's requests and made the trip, along with Louis J. Weichmann, her boarder and son's friend.
This exchange, and her compliance in it, would lead directly to Surratt's execution three months later.At seven o'clock that evening, John Wilkes Booth met for a final time with all his fellow conspirators.
Booth assigned Lewis Powell to kill Secretary of State William H. Seward at his home, George Atzerodt to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson at his residence, the Kirkwood Hotel, and David E. Herold to guide Powell to the Seward house and then out of Washington to rendezvous with Booth in Maryland.
Booth planned to shoot Lincoln with his single-shot Derringer and then stab Grant with a knife at Ford's Theatre.
They were all to strike simultaneously shortly after ten o'clock that night.
Atzerodt wanted nothing to do with it, saying he had only signed up for a kidnapping, not a killing.
Booth told him he was in too far to back out. 
How much was America's down payment on the Louisiana Purchase?
The American government used $3 million in gold as a down payment, and issued bonds for the balance to pay France for the purchase.
Earlier that year, Francis Baring and Company of London had become the U.S. government's official banking agent in London.
Because of this favored position, the US asked the Baring firm to handle the transaction.
Francis Baring's son Alexander was in Paris at the time and helped in the negotiations.
Another Baring advantage was a close relationship with Hope and Company of Amsterdam.
The two banking houses worked together to facilitate and underwrite the Purchase.
Because Napoleon wanted to receive his money as quickly as possible, the two firms received the American bonds and paid cash to France.
what was the key raw ingredient?
Uranium.Ore.The key raw material for the project was uranium, which was used as fuel for the reactors, as feed that was transformed into plutonium, and, in its enriched form, in the atomic bomb itself.
There were four known major deposits of uranium in 1940: in Colorado, in northern Canada, in Joachimstal in Czechoslovakia, and in the Belgian Congo.
All but Joachimstal were in allied hands.
A November 1942 survey determined that sufficient quantities of uranium were available to satisfy the project's requirements.
Nichols arranged with the State Department for export controls to be placed on uranium oxide and negotiated for the purchase of of uranium ore from the Belgian Congo that was being stored in a warehouse on Staten Island and the remaining stocks of mined ore stored in the Congo.
He negotiated with Eldorado Gold Mines for the purchase of ore from its mine in Port Hope, Ontario, and its shipment in 100-ton lots.
The Canadian government subsequently bought up the company's stock until it acquired a controlling interest.While these purchases assured a sufficient supply to meet wartime needs, the American and British leaders concluded that it was in their countries' interest to gain control of as much of the world's uranium deposits as possible.
The richest source of ore was the Shinkolobwe mine in the Belgian Congo, but it was flooded and closed.
Nichols unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate its reopening and the sale of the entire future output to the United States with Edgar Sengier, the director of the company that owned the mine, Union Minière du Haut Katanga.
The matter was then taken up by the Combined Policy Committee.
As 30 percent of Union Minière's stock was controlled by British interests, the British took the lead in negotiations.
Sir John Anderson and Ambassador John Winant hammered out a deal with Sengier and the Belgian government in May 1944 for the mine to be reopened and of ore to be purchased at $1.45 a pound.
To avoid dependence on the British and Canadians for ore, Groves also arranged for the purchase of US Vanadium Corporation's stockpile in Uravan, Colorado.
Uranium mining in Colorado yielded about of ore.Mallinckrodt Incorporated in St. Louis, Missouri, took the raw ore and dissolved it in nitric acid to produce uranyl nitrate.
Ether was then added in a liquid–liquid extraction process to separate the impurities from the uranyl nitrate.
This was then heated to form uranium trioxide, which was reduced to highly pure uranium dioxide.
By July 1942, Mallinckrodt was producing a ton of highly pure oxide a day, but turning this into uranium metal initially proved more difficult for contractors Westinghouse and Metal Hydrides.
Production was too slow and quality was unacceptably low.
A special branch of the Metallurgical Laboratory was established at Iowa State College in Ames, Iowa, under Frank Spedding to investigate alternatives, and its Ames process became available in 1943.
By 1973, how many women had served in  Vietnam?
Women in the Vietnam War.American nurses.During the Vietnam War, American women served on active duty doing a variety of jobs.
Early in 1963, the Army Nurse Corps (ANC) launched Operation Nightingale, an intensive effort to recruit nurses to serve in Vietnam.
Most nurses who volunteered to serve in Vietnam came from predominantly working or middle-class families with histories of military service.
The majority of these women were white Catholics and Protestants.
Because the need for medical aid was great, many nurses underwent a concentrated four-month training program before being deployed to Vietnam in the ANC.
Due to the shortage of staff, nurses usually worked twelve-hour shifts, six days per week and often suffered from exhaustion.
First Lieutenant Sharon Lane was the only female military nurse to be killed by enemy gunfire during the war, on 8 June 1969.At the start of the Vietnam War, it was commonly thought that American women had no place in the military.
Their traditional place had been in the domestic sphere, but with the war came opportunity for the expansion of gender roles.
In Vietnam, women held a variety of jobs which included operating complex data processing equipment and serving as stenographers.
Although a small number of women were assigned to combat zones, they were never allowed directly in the field of battle.
The women who served in the military were solely volunteers.
They faced a plethora of challenges, one of which was the relatively small number of female soldiers.
Living in a male-dominated environment created tensions between the sexes.
While this high male to female ratio was often uncomfortable for women, many men reported that having women in the field with them boosted their morale.
Although this was not the women's purpose, it was one positive result of the their service.
By 1973, approximately 7,500 women had served in Vietnam in the Southeast Asian theater.
In that same year, the military lifted the prohibition on women entering the armed forces.American women serving in Vietnam were subject to societal stereotypes.
Many Americans either considered females serving in Vietnam masculine for living under the army discipline, or judged them to be women of questionable moral character who enlisted for the sole purpose of seducing men.
To address this problem, the ANC released advertisements portraying women in the ANC as "proper, professional and well protected."
(26) This effort to highlight the positive aspects of a nursing career reflected the ideas of second-wave feminism that occurred during the 1960s–1970s in the United States.
Although female military nurses lived in a heavily male environment, very few cases of sexual harassment were ever reported.
In 2008, by contrast, approximately one-third of women in the military felt that they had been sexually harassed compared with one-third of men.
Why did the Apollo landing crew decide to begin preparations for the EVA early?
When Armstrong again looked outside, he saw that the computer's landing target was in a boulder-strewn area just north and east of a diameter crater (later determined to be "West crater," named for its location in the western part of the originally planned landing ellipse).
Armstrong took semi-automatic control and, with Aldrin calling out altitude and velocity data, landed at 20:17:40 UTC on July 20 with about 25 seconds of fuel left.Apollo 11 landed with less fuel than other missions, and the astronauts encountered a premature low fuel warning.
This was later found to be the result of greater propellant 'slosh' than expected, uncovering a fuel sensor.
On subsequent missions, extra anti-slosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this.Throughout the descent Aldrin had called out navigation data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting the LM.
A few moments before the landing, a light informed Aldrin that at least one of the probes hanging from "Eagle"'s footpads had touched the surface, and he said "Contact light!"
Three seconds later, "Eagle" landed and Armstrong said "Shutdown."
Aldrin immediately said "Okay, engine stop.
ACA - out of detent."
Armstrong acknowledged "Out of detent.
Auto" and Aldrin continued "Mode control - both auto.
Descent engine command override off.
Engine arm - off.
413 is in.
"Charles Duke, acting as CAPCOM during the landing phase, acknowledged their landing by saying "We copy you down, Eagle.
"Armstrong acknowledged Aldrin's completion of the post landing checklist with "Engine arm is off," before responding to Duke with the words, "Houston, Tranquility Base here.
The "Eagle" has landed."
Armstrong's unrehearsed change of call sign from "Eagle" to "Tranquility Base" emphasized to listeners that landing was complete and successful.
Duke mispronounced his reply as he expressed the relief at Mission Control: "Roger, Twan-- Tranquility, we copy you on the ground.
You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue.
We're breathing again.
Thanks a lot.
"Two and a half hours after landing, before preparations began for the EVA, Aldrin broadcast that:The schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five-hour sleep period, since they had been awake since early morning.
However, they elected to forgo the sleep period and begin the preparations for the EVA early, thinking that they would be unable to sleep.
What else were Revolutionaries called?
At the time, revolutionaries were called "Patriots", "Whigs", "Congress-men", or "Americans".
They included a full range of social and economic classes, but were unanimous regarding the need to defend the rights of Americans and uphold the principles of republicanism in terms of rejecting monarchy and aristocracy, while emphasizing civic virtue on the part of the citizens.
Newspapers were strongholds of patriotism (although there were a few Loyalist papers), and printed many pamphlets, announcements, patriotic letters and pronouncements.Mark Lender explores why ordinary folk became insurgents against the British even though they were unfamiliar with the ideological rationales being offered.
They held very strongly a sense of "rights" that they felt the British were violating – rights that stressed local autonomy, fair dealing, and government by consent.
They were highly sensitive to the issue of tyranny, which they saw manifested in the British response to the Boston Tea Party.
The arrival in Boston of the British Army heightened their sense of violated rights, leading to rage and demands for revenge.
They had faith that God was on their side.
What year did Wilbur die in?
Another acclaimed aviator, Glenn Curtiss, had agreed to participate.
Curtiss had recently set the world flight speed record in France, and the Wrights had just filed suit against him for patent infringement of their control systems.
The public's anticipation was fueled by news of the patent disputes.
These flights would be a showdown between the two fliers.
They were both scheduled to make a series of flights from Governors Island in New York harbor.
On September 29, Wilbur took off at 9:15 AM in windy conditions.
Curtiss felt his airplane could not handle the winds and he declined to fly.
When Curtiss admitted defeat to the wind, Wilbur is supposed to have said to him, 'It looks pretty good.
I think I will take a little spin in a few minutes.'
He flew for about two miles, which took a little longer than seven minutes.Later that day Wilbur took off again, at 10:18 AM.
He flew over the ocean-liner RMS Lusitania and a flotilla of other watercraft on hand for the Hudson-Fulton celebration, many blowing their horns and tooting their whistles when the Flyer appeared overhead.
As Wilbur flew toward the Statue of Liberty, many onlookers feared he would crash into it, but he skillfully circled the statue as planned.
This flight caused a sensation in the press and became an iconic event, despite lasting less than five minutes.Still unable to fly in the gusty weather, Curtiss had to depart for St. Louis due to a prior agreement.
He was supposed to have flown up the Hudson River for several miles and returned to Governors Island.On Monday, October 4, Wilbur took off at 9:53 AM.
He flew north over the Hudson along the west shore of Manhattan, passing Grant's Tomb, then returned by the same route, finishing the 21 mile, 33-minute flight with a safe landing on Governor's Island.
As many as a million people witnessed the flight.
This was the exact flight that Curtiss had been unable to make.
Before the flight, Wilbur attached a red canoe to the bottom of the airplane as a safety precaution in case of an emergency landing in the water.
He reasoned that he could use the canoe to float himself to safety.
A blown engine cylinder that afternoon prevented any more flights.
This series of flights marked Wilbur's last flying before a public audience.
After Wilbur's death in 1912, Orville put the canoe in Hawthorn Hill, his estate in Oakwood, Ohio, as a memento.
This first airborne canoe was later moved to Carillon Historical Park in Ohio and exhibited in a room adjacent to the Wright Flyer III in Wright Hall.The flight around the Statue of Liberty was duplicated on May 26, 2003 by the Dayton 'Wright B Flyer, Inc.' group, with a replica of the Wright airplane as a part of the celebrations of the anniversary of the Wright brothers' first flight.

What did the demonstrators disguised themselves as?
The Boston Tea Party (initially referred to by John Adams as "the Destruction of the Tea in Boston") was a political protest by the Sons of Liberty in Boston, on December 16, 1773.
Disguised as American Indians, the demonstrators destroyed an entire shipment of tea, which had been sent by the East India Company, in defiance of the Tea Act of May 10, 1773.
They boarded the ships and threw the chests of tea into Boston Harbor, ruining the tea.
The British government responded harshly and the episode escalated into the American Revolution.
The Tea Party became an iconic event of American history, and other political protests such as the Tea Party movement after 2010 explicitly refer to it.The Tea Party was the culmination of a resistance movement throughout British America against the Tea Act, which had been passed by the British Parliament in 1773.
Colonists objected to the Tea Act because they believed that it violated their rights as Englishmen to "No taxation without representation," that is, be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a British parliament in which they were not represented.
Protesters had successfully prevented the unloading of taxed tea in three other colonies, but in Boston, embattled Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.The Boston Tea Party was a key event in the growth of the American Revolution.
Parliament responded in 1774 with the Coercive Acts, or Intolerable Acts, which, among other provisions, ended local self-government in Massachusetts and closed Boston's commerce.
Colonists up and down the Thirteen Colonies in turn responded to the Coercive Acts with additional acts of protest, and by convening the First Continental Congress, which petitioned the British monarch for repeal of the acts and coordinated colonial resistance to them.
The crisis escalated, and the American Revolutionary War began near Boston in 1775.
Which countries governments provided state funding to new industries?
Industrialisation beyond Great Britain.Continental Europe.The Industrial Revolution on Continental Europe came a little later than in Great Britain.
In many industries, this involved the application of technology developed in Britain in new places.
Often the technology was purchased from Britain or British engineers and entrepreneurs moved abroad in search of new opportunities.
By 1809 part of the Ruhr Valley in Westphalia was called 'Miniature England' because of its similarities to the industrial areas of England.
The German, Russian and Belgian governments all provided state funding to the new industries.
In some cases (such as iron), the different availability of resources locally meant that only some aspects of the British technology were adopted.
What do Monetarists argue caused the Great Depression?
Monetarists, including Milton Friedman, argue that the Great Depression was mainly caused by monetary contraction, the consequence of poor policy-making by the American Federal Reserve System and continued crisis in the banking system.
In this view, the Federal Reserve, by not acting, allowed the money supply as measured by the M2 to shrink by one-third from 1929–1933, thereby transforming a normal recession into the Great Depression.
Friedman argued that the downward turn in the economy, starting with the stock market crash, would have been just another recession.The Federal Reserve allowed some large public bank failures – particularly that of the New York Bank of the United States – which produced panic and widespread runs on local banks, and the Federal Reserve sat idly by while banks collapsed.
He claimed that, if the Fed had provided emergency lending to these key banks, or simply bought government bonds on the open market to provide liquidity and increase the quantity of money after the key banks fell, all the rest of the banks would not have fallen after the large ones did, and the money supply would not have fallen as far and as fast as it did.With significantly less money to go around, businessmen could not get new loans and could not even get their old loans renewed, forcing many to stop investing.
This interpretation blames the Federal Reserve for inaction, especially the New York branch.One reason why the Federal Reserve did not act to limit the decline of the money supply was regulation.
At that time, the amount of credit the Federal Reserve could issue was limited by the Federal Reserve Act, which required 40% gold backing of Federal Reserve Notes issued.
By the late 1920s, the Federal Reserve had almost hit the limit of allowable credit that could be backed by the gold in its possession.
This credit was in the form of Federal Reserve demand notes.A "promise of gold" is not as good as "gold in the hand", particularly when they only had enough gold to cover 40% of the Federal Reserve Notes outstanding.
During the bank panics a portion of those demand notes were redeemed for Federal Reserve gold.
Since the Federal Reserve had hit its limit on allowable credit, any reduction in gold in its vaults had to be accompanied by a greater reduction in credit.
On April 5, 1933, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 6102 making the private ownership of gold certificates, coins and bullion illegal, reducing the pressure on Federal Reserve gold.
Glasnost was intended to reduce the corruption at the top of which party?
Final years (1985–91).Gorbachev reforms.By the time the comparatively youthful Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary in 1985, the Soviet economy was stagnant and faced a sharp fall in foreign currency earnings as a result of the downward slide in oil prices in the 1980s.
These issues prompted Gorbachev to investigate measures to revive the ailing state.An ineffectual start led to the conclusion that deeper structural changes were necessary and in June 1987 Gorbachev announced an agenda of economic reform called "perestroika", or restructuring.
Perestroika relaxed the production quota system, allowed private ownership of businesses and paved the way for foreign investment.
These measures were intended to redirect the country's resources from costly Cold War military commitments to more productive areas in the civilian sector.Despite initial skepticism in the West, the new Soviet leader proved to be committed to reversing the Soviet Union's deteriorating economic condition instead of continuing the arms race with the West.
Partly as a way to fight off internal opposition from party cliques to his reforms, Gorbachev simultaneously introduced "glasnost", or openness, which increased freedom of the press and the transparency of state institutions.
"Glasnost" was intended to reduce the corruption at the top of the Communist Party and moderate the abuse of power in the Central Committee.
Glasnost also enabled increased contact between Soviet citizens and the western world, particularly with the United States, contributing to the accelerating détente between the two nations.
What was the estimates number of black people in Germany when the Nazis came to power?
The number of black people in Germany when the Nazis came to power is variously estimated at 5,000–25,000.
It is not clear whether these figures included Asians.
According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington, D.C., "The fate of black people from 1933 to 1945 in Nazi Germany and in German-occupied territories ranged from isolation to persecution, sterilization, medical experimentation, incarceration, brutality, and murder.
However, there was no systematic program for their elimination as there was for Jews and other groups."
Meanwhile, Afrikaaners, Berbers, Iranians and Pre-Partition Indians were classified as Aryans, so not persecuted (see main article).
Racial restrictions were relaxed to the extent that Turkic peoples, Arabs and South Asians were recruited by the German military due to the shortage of manpower.
How long was Germany forbidden to manufacture or import aircraft?
The treaty was comprehensive and complex in the restrictions imposed upon the post-war German armed forces (Reichswehr).
The provisions were intended to make the incapable of offensive action and to encourage international disarmament.
Germany was to demobilize sufficient soldiers by 31 March 1920, to leave an army of no more than in a maximum of seven infantry and three cavalry divisions.
The treaty laid down the organisation of the divisions and support units, and the General Staff was to be dissolved.
Military schools for officer training were limited to three, one school per arm and conscription was to abolished.
Private soldiers and Non-commissioned officers were to be retained for at least twelve years and officers for a minimum of with former officers being forbidden to attend military exercises.
To prevent Germany from building up a large cadre of trained men, the number of men allowed to leave early was limited.The number of civilian staff supporting the army was reduced and the police force reduced to its pre-war size, with increases limited to population increases; paramilitary forces were forbidden.
The Rhineland was to be demilitarized, all fortifications in the Rhineland and east of the river were to be demolished and new construction was forbidden.
Military structures and fortifications on the islands of Heligoland and Düne were to be destroyed.
Germany was prohibited from the arms trade, limits were imposed on the type and quantity of weapons and prohibited from the manufacture or stockpile of chemical weapons, armored cars, tanks and military aircraft.
The German navy was allowed six pre-dreadnought battleships and was limited to a maximum of six light cruisers (not exceeding ), twelve destroyers (not exceeding ) and twelve torpedo boats (not exceeding ) and was forbidden submarines.
The manpower of the navy was not to exceed including manning for the fleet, coast defences, signal stations, administration, other land services, officers and men of all grades and corps.
The number of officers and warrant officers was not allowed to exceed Germany surrendered eight battleships, eight light cruisers, forty-two destroyers, and fifty torpedo boats for decommissioning.
Thirty-two auxiliary ships were to be disarmed and converted to merchant use.
Article 198 prohibited Germany from having an air force, including naval air forces, and required Germany to hand over all aerial related materials.
In conjunction, Germany was forbidden to manufacture or import aircraft or related material for a period of six months following the signing of the treaty.
What did a quarter million construction workers reach their lifetime limits on
The worst of the radioactive debris was collected inside what was left of the reactor, much of it shoveled in by liquidators wearing heavy protective gear (dubbed "bio-robots" by the military); these workers could only spend a maximum of 40 seconds at a time working on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings because of the extremely high doses of radiation given off by the blocks of graphite and other debris.
The reactor itself was covered with bags of sand, lead and boric acid dropped from helicopters: some 5,000 metric tons of material were dropped during the week that followed the accident.At the time there was still fear that the reactor could re-enter a self-sustaining nuclear chain-reaction and explode again, and a new containment structure was planned to prevent rain entering and triggering such an explosion, and to prevent further release of radioactive material.
This was the largest civil engineering task in history, involving a quarter of a million construction workers who all reached their official lifetime limits of radiation.
By December 1986, a large concrete sarcophagus had been erected to seal off the reactor and its contents.
A unique "clean up" medal was given to the workers.Many of the vehicles used by the "liquidators" remain parked in a field in the Chernobyl area.During the construction of the sarcophagus, a scientific team re-entered the reactor as part of an investigation dubbed "Complex Expedition", to locate and contain nuclear fuel in a way that could not lead to another explosion.
These scientists manually collected cold fuel rods, but great heat was still emanating from the core.
Rates of radiation in different parts of the building were monitored by drilling holes into the reactor and inserting long metal detector tubes.
The scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation and radioactive dust.After six months of investigation, in December 1986, they discovered with the help of a remote camera an intensely radioactive mass in the basement of Unit Four, more than two metres wide and weighing hundreds of tons, which they called "the elephant's foot" for its wrinkled appearance.
The mass was composed of sand, glass and a large amount of nuclear fuel that had escaped from the reactor.
The concrete beneath the reactor was steaming hot, and was breached by solidified lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms termed chernobylite.
It was concluded that there was no further risk of explosion.

what year was the final leg of the moon race
1969 saw the final leg of the Moon Race, with the United States leading it after the flight of Apollo 8.
Unbeknownst to the Americans, the Soviet moon program was in deep trouble.
Without the N-1 rocket, the USSR had no way to land on the Moon.
The next two Apollo missions proved that the Lunar Module worked well, both in low-Earth orbit and in lunar orbit.
It was time to proceed to an actual landing mission.
Under this backdrop, Apollo 11 was being prepared for a July encounter with the Moon.The Apollo 11 crew consisted of commander (CDR) Neil Armstrong, command module pilot (CMP) Michael Collins, and lunar module pilot (LMP) Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin.
They were selected as the crew in January 1969, and they trained for the mission until just before the actual launch day.
On July 16, 1969, at exactly 9:32 am EDT, the Saturn V rocket – serial number SA-506 – lifted off from Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida with Apollo 11 on board.The lunar trip took just over three days.
After achieving orbit, Armstrong and Aldrin transferred into the Lunar Module, named "Eagle", and began their descent.
After overcoming several computer malfunctions, Armstrong took over manual flight-control at about , and guided the Lunar Module to a landing on the Moon's Sea of Tranquility at 4:17 pm EDT, July 20, 1969.
The first humans on the Moon would wait another six hours before they ventured out of their craft.
At 10:56:15 pm EDT, Armstrong became the first human to set foot on the Moon.The first step was witnessed by at least 500 million TV viewers on Earth.
His first words when he stepped off the LM's landing pad were, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."
Aldrin joined him on the surface almost 20 minutes later.
Altogether, they spent just under two and one-quarter hours outside their craft.
The next day, they performed the first launch from another celestial body, and rendezvoused with the "Columbia" Command Module.Apollo 11 safely left lunar orbit and returned to Earth, landing in the Pacific Ocean on July 24, 1969.
When the spacecraft splashed down, 2,982 days had passed since Kennedy committed the United States to landing a man on the Moon and bringing him back safely to the Earth before the end of the decade; the mission was completed with just 161 days to spare.
With the safe completion of the Apollo 11 mission, the Americans won the race to the Moon.This was followed by successful lunar landings on Apollo 12 (November 1969), Apollo 14 (February 1971), Apollo 15 (July 1971), Apollo 16 (April 1972), and Apollo 17 (December 1972).
One lunar landing attempt, Apollo 13 (April 1970), was unsuccessful, but the crew returned safely.
Can sense and antisense sequences exist on different parts of the same strand of DNA
A DNA sequence is called "sense" if its sequence is the same as that of a messenger RNA copy that is translated into protein.
The sequence on the opposite strand is called the "antisense" sequence.
Both sense and antisense sequences can exist on different parts of the same strand of DNA (i.e.
both strands can contain both sense and antisense sequences).
In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, antisense RNA sequences are produced, but the functions of these RNAs are not entirely clear.
One proposal is that antisense RNAs are involved in regulating gene expression through RNA-RNA base pairing.A few DNA sequences in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and more in plasmids and viruses, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping genes.
In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read in the opposite direction along the other strand.
In bacteria, this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription, while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.
Why are the locations of the sea important?
Over the course of millions of years, the motion of tectonic plates reconfigures global land and ocean areas and generates topography.
This can affect both global and local patterns of climate and atmosphere-ocean circulation.The position of the continents determines the geometry of the oceans and therefore influences patterns of ocean circulation.
The locations of the seas are important in controlling the transfer of heat and moisture across the globe, and therefore, in determining global climate.
A recent example of tectonic control on ocean circulation is the formation of the Isthmus of Panama about 5 million years ago, which shut off direct mixing between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
This strongly affected the ocean dynamics of what is now the Gulf Stream and may have led to Northern Hemisphere ice cover.
During the Carboniferous period, about 300 to 360 million years ago, plate tectonics may have triggered large-scale storage of carbon and increased glaciation.
Geologic evidence points to a "megamonsoonal" circulation pattern during the time of the supercontinent Pangaea, and climate modeling suggests that the existence of the supercontinent was conducive to the establishment of monsoons.The size of continents is also important.
Because of the stabilizing effect of the oceans on temperature, yearly temperature variations are generally lower in coastal areas than they are inland.
A larger supercontinent will therefore have more area in which climate is strongly seasonal than will several smaller continents or islands.
What are fetal stem cells?
The primitive stem cells located in the organs of fetuses are referred to as fetal stem cells.There are two types of fetal stem cells:
 Fetal proper stem cells come from the tissue of the fetus proper, and are generally obtained after an abortion.
These stem cells are not immortal but have a high level of division and are multipotent.
 Extraembryonic fetal stem cells come from extraembryonic membranes, and are generally not distinguished from adult stem cells.
These stem cells are acquired after birth, they are not immortal but have a high level of cell division, and are pluripotent.
When did the museum announce it was stopping the project
 extinct and endangered species.Cloning, or more precisely, the reconstruction of functional DNA from extinct species has, for decades, been a dream of some scientists.
Current cloning techniques have an average success rate of less than 5 percent, even when working with familiar species; cloning wild animals is usually less than 1 percent successful.
The possible implications of this were dramatized in the best-selling novel by Michael Crichton and high budget Hollywood thriller "Jurassic Park".
Early hopes to save species through cloning have been dashed as the difficulties of cloning any species have made progress very slow.
Several tissue banks have come into existence, including the "Frozen Zoo" at the San Diego Zoo, to store frozen tissue from the world's rarest and most endangered species.In 2001, a cow named Bessie gave birth to a cloned Asian gaur, an endangered species, but the calf died after two days.
In 2003, a banteng was successfully cloned, followed by three African wildcats from a thawed frozen embryo.
These successes provided hope that similar techniques (using surrogate mothers of another species) might be used to clone extinct species.
Anticipating this possibility, tissue samples from the last "bucardo" (Pyrenean Ibex) were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after it died in 2000.
Researchers are also considering cloning endangered species such as the giant panda and cheetah.In 2002, geneticists at the Australian Museum announced that they had replicated DNA of the Thylacine (Tasmanian Tiger), at the time extinct for about 65 years, using polymerase chain reaction.
However, on February 15, 2005 the museum announced that it was stopping the project after tests showed the specimens' DNA had been too badly degraded by the (ethanol) preservative.
On 15 May 2005 it was announced that the Thylacine project would be revived, with new participation from researchers in New South Wales and Victoria.In January 2009, for the first time, an extinct animal, the Pyrenean ibex mentioned above was cloned, at the Centre of Food Technology and Research of Aragon, using the preserved DNA of the skin samples from 2001 and domestic goat egg-cells.
The ibex died shortly after birth due to physical defects in its lungs.One of the most anticipated targets for cloning was once the Woolly Mammoth, but attempts to extract DNA from frozen mammoths have been unsuccessful, though a joint Russo-Japanese team is currently working toward this goal.
In January 2011, it was reported by Yomiuri Shimbun that a team of scientists headed by Akira Iritani of Kyoto University had built upon research by Dr. Wakayama, saying that they will extract DNA from a mammoth carcass that had been preserved in a Russian laboratory and insert it into the egg cells of an African elephant in hopes of producing a mammoth embryo.
The researchers said they hoped to produce a baby mammoth within six years.Scientists at the University of Newcastle and University of New South Wales announced in March 2013 that the very recently extinct gastric-brooding frog would be the subject of a cloning attempt to resurrect the species.
In what year was the Framework Convention agreed?
Discourse about global warming.Political discussion.Most countries are Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).The ultimate objective of the Convention is to prevent dangerous human interference of the climate system.As is stated in the Convention, this requires that GHG concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change, food production is not threatened, and economic development can proceed in a sustainable fashion.
The Framework Convention was agreed in 1992, but since then, global emissions have risen.
During negotiations, the G77 (a lobbying group in the United Nations representing 133 developing nations) pushed for a mandate requiring developed countries to " the lead" in reducing their emissions.
This was justified on the basis that: the developed world's emissions had contributed most to the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere; per-capita emissions (i.e., emissions per head of population) were still relatively low in developing countries; and the emissions of developing countries would grow to meet their development needs.
This mandate was sustained in the Kyoto Protocol to the Framework Convention, which entered into legal effect in 2005.In ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, most developed countries accepted legally binding commitments to limit their emissions.
These first-round commitments expired in 2012.US President George W. Bush rejected the treaty on the basis that "it exempts 80% of the world, including major population centers such as China and India, from compliance, and would cause serious harm to the US economy.
"At the 15th UNFCCC Conference of the Parties, held in 2009 at Copenhagen, several UNFCCC Parties produced the Copenhagen Accord.Parties associated with the Accord (140 countries, as of November 2010)aim to limit the future increase in global mean temperature to below .
A preliminary assessment published in November 2010 by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) suggests a possible "emissions gap" between the voluntary pledges made in the Accord and the emissions cuts necessary to have a "likely" (greater than 66% probability) chance of meeting the objective.The UNEP assessment takes the objective as being measured against the pre-industrial global mean temperature level.
To having a likely chance of meeting the objective, assessed studies generally indicated the need for global emissions to peak before 2020, with substantial declines in emissions thereafter.The 16th Conference of the Parties (COP16) was held at Cancún in 2010.
It produced an agreement, not a binding treaty, that the Parties should take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to meet a goal of limiting global warming to above pre-industrial temperatures.
It also recognized the need to consider strengthening the goal to a global average rise of .
Into what three major categories can the elements be classified into?
The elements can be conveniently classified according to their shared physical and chemical properties into the major categories of metals, metalloids and nonmetals.
Metals are generally located to the left and bottom of the periodic table.
They are ordinarily shiny, highly conducting solids which form alloys with one another and salt-like ionic compounds with nonmetals.
Nonmetals are located to the right and top.
They are mostly coloured or colourless insulating gases that form covalent compounds with one another.
In between metals and nonmetals are metalloids, which have intermediate or mixed properties.Metal and nonmetals can be further classified into similar subcategories that show a left to right gradation in metallic to non-metallic properties.
The metals are divided into the highly reactive alkali metals, through the less reactive alkaline earth metals, lanthanides and actinides, via the archetypal transition metals, and ending in the physically and chemically weak other metals.
The nonmetals are simply subdivided into the polyatomic nonmetals which, being nearest the metalloids, show some incipient metallic character; the diatomic nonmetals, which are essentially nonmetallic; and the monatomic noble gases, which are almost completely inert and nonmetallic.
Specialized groupings such as the refractory metals and the noble metals, which are subsets (in this example) of the transition metals, are also known and occasionally denoted.Placing the elements into categories and subcategories based on shared properties is imperfect.
There is a spectrum of properties within each category and it is not hard to find overlaps at the boundaries, as is the case with most classification schemes.
Beryllium, for example, is classified as an alkaline earth metal although its amphoteric chemistry and tendency to mostly form covalent compounds are both attributes of a chemically weak or other metal.
Radon is classified as a nonmetal and a noble gas yet has some cationic chemistry that is more characteristic of a metal.
Other classification schemes are possible such as the division of the elements into mineralogical occurrence categories, or crystalline structures.
Categorising the elements in this fashion dates back to at least 1869 when Hinrichs wrote that simple boundary lines could be drawn on the periodic table to show elements having like properties, such as the metals and the nonmetals, or the gaseous elements.
Quantum field theory unified what two theory's?
While physics aims to discover universal laws, its theories lie in explicit domains of applicability.
Loosely speaking, the laws of classical physics accurately describe systems whose important length scales are greater than the atomic scale and whose motions are much slower than the speed of light.
Outside of this domain, observations do not match their predictions.
Albert Einstein contributed the framework of special relativity, which replaced notions of absolute time and space with spacetime and allowed an accurate description of systems whose components have speeds approaching the speed of light.
Max Planck, Erwin Schrödinger, and others introduced quantum mechanics, a probabilistic notion of particles and interactions that allowed an accurate description of atomic and subatomic scales.
Later, quantum field theory unified quantum mechanics and special relativity.
General relativity allowed for a dynamical, curved spacetime, with which highly massive systems and the large-scale structure of the universe can be well-described.
General relativity has not yet been unified with the other fundamental descriptions; several candidate theories of quantum gravity are being developed.
what is homeostasis?
Homeostasis is the ability of an open system to regulate its internal environment to maintain stable conditions by means of multiple dynamic equilibrium adjustments controlled by interrelated regulation mechanisms.
All living organisms, whether unicellular or multicellular, exhibit homeostasis.To maintain dynamic equilibrium and effectively carry out certain functions, a system must detect and respond to perturbations.
After the detection of a perturbation, a biological system normally responds through negative feedback.
This means stabilizing conditions by either reducing or increasing the activity of an organ or system.
One example is the release of glucagon when sugar levels are too low.
what inhabitated the earth 3 billion years agi
 of life.Prokaryotes inhabited the Earth from approximately 3–4 billion years ago.
*</ref> No obvious changes in morphology or cellular organisation occurred in these organisms over the next few billion years.
The eukaryotic cells emerged between 1.6 – 2.7 billion years ago.
The next major change in cell structure came when bacteria were engulfed by eukaryotic cells, in a cooperative association called endosymbiosis.
The engulfed bacteria and the host cell then underwent co-evolution, with the bacteria evolving into either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes.
Another engulfment of cyanobacterial-like organisms led to the formation of chloroplasts in algae and plants.
*</ref>The history of life was that of the unicellular eukaryotes, prokaryotes and archaea until about 610 million years ago when multicellular organisms began to appear in the oceans in the Ediacaran period.
The evolution of multicellularity occurred in multiple independent events, in organisms as diverse as sponges, brown algae, cyanobacteria, slime moulds and myxobacteria.Soon after the emergence of these first multicellular organisms, a remarkable amount of biological diversity appeared over approximately 10 million years, in an event called the Cambrian explosion.
Here, the majority of types of modern animals appeared in the fossil record, as well as unique lineages that subsequently became extinct.
Various triggers for the Cambrian explosion have been proposed, including the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere from photosynthesis.
*</ref>About 500 million years ago, plants and fungi colonised the land and were soon followed by arthropods and other animals.
Insects were particularly successful and even today make up the majority of animal species.
Amphibians first appeared around 364 million years ago, followed by early amniotes and birds around 155 million years ago (both from "reptile"-like lineages), mammals around 129 million years ago, homininae around 10 million years ago and modern humans around 250,000 years ago.
However, despite the evolution of these large animals, smaller organisms similar to the types that evolved early in this process continue to be highly successful and dominate the Earth, with the majority of both biomass and species being prokaryotes.
Nervous tissue is derived from what?
All vertebrates are built along the basic chordate body plan: a stiff rod running through the length of the animal (vertebral column or notochord), with a hollow tube of nervous tissue, the spinal cord above it and the gastrointestinal tract below.
Nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm, connective tissues are derived from mesoderm, and gut is derived from the endoderm.
At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut.
The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the anus at the base of the tail.
The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column, in which the notochord has been replaced by a segmented series of stiffer elements (vertebrae) separated by mobile joints (intervertebral discs), which each contain a soft central core (nucleus pulposus), derived from the notochord of the embryo.
However, a few vertebrates have secondarily lost this anatomy, retaining the notochord into adulthood.
These include the sturgeon and the coelacanth.
Jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost.
The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor.
This is one of the arguments put forward by Charles Darwin to support his theory of evolution.
What is the "Mars effect"?
Astrology has not demonstrated its effectiveness in controlled studies and has no scientific validity, and as such, is regarded as pseudoscience.
Where astrology has made falsifiable predictions, it has been falsified.
Shawn Carlson's double-blind chart matching test, in which twenty eight astrologers agreed to match over 100 natal charts to psychological profiles generated by the California Psychological Inventory (CPI) test, is one of the most renowned tests of astrology.
The experimental protocol used in Carlson's study was agreed to by a group of physicists and astrologers prior to the experiment.
Astrologers, nominated by the National Council for Geocosmic Research, acted as the astrological advisors, and helped to ensure, and agreed, that the test was fair.
They also chose twentysix of the twentyeight astrologers for the tests, the other two being interested astrologers who volunteered afterwards.
The astrologers, from Europe and the United States, helped to draw up the central proposition of natal astrology to be tested.
Published in "Nature" in 1985, the study found that predictions based on natal astrology were no better than chance, and that the testing "clearly refutes the astrological hypothesis".In 1955, astrologer and psychologist Michel Gauquelin stated that although he had failed to find evidence to support such indicators as the zodiacal signs and planetary aspects in astrology, he had found positive correlations between the diurnal positions of some of the planets and success in some professions which astrology traditionally associates with those planets.
The best-known of Gauquelin's findings is based on the positions of Mars in the natal charts of successful athletes and became known as the "Mars effect".
A study conducted by seven French scientists attempted to replicate the claim, but found no statistical evidence.
They attributed the effect to selective bias on Gauquelin's part, accusing him of attempting to persuade them to add or delete names from their study.Geoffrey Dean has suggested that the effect may be caused by self-reporting of birth dates by parents rather than any issue with the study by Gauquelin.
The suggestion is that a small subset of the parents may have had changed birth times to be consistent with better astrological charts for a related profession.
The sample group was taken from a time where belief in astrology was more common.
Gauquelin had failed to find the Mars effect in more recent populations, where a nurse or doctor recorded the birth information.
The number of births under astrologically undesirable conditions was also lower, indicating more evidence that parents choose dates and times to suit their beliefs.Dean, a scientist and former astrologer, and psychologist Ivan Kelly conducted a large scale scientific test, involving more than one hundred cognitive, behavioural, physical and other variables, but found no support for astrology.
Furthermore, a meta-analysis was conducted pooling 40 studies consisting of 700 astrologers and over 1,000 birth charts.
Ten of the tests, which had a total of 300 participating, involved the astrologers picking the correct chart interpretation out of a number of others which were not the astrologically correct chart interpretation (usually 3 to 5 others).
When the date and other obvious clues were removed no significant results were found to suggest there was any preferred chart.
Are there dwarf plants in the Kuiper belt?
The Kuiper belt is a great ring of debris similar to the asteroid belt, but consisting mainly of objects composed primarily of ice.
It extends between 30 and 50 AU from the Sun.
Though it is estimated to contain anything from dozens to thousands of dwarf planets, it is composed mainly of small Solar System bodies.
Many of the larger Kuiper belt objects, such as Quaoar, Varuna, and Orcus, may prove to be dwarf planets with further data.
There are estimated to be over 100,000 Kuiper belt objects with a diameter greater than 50 km, but the total mass of the Kuiper belt is thought to be only a tenth or even a hundredth the mass of Earth.
Many Kuiper belt objects have multiple satellites, and most have orbits that take them outside the plane of the ecliptic.The Kuiper belt can be roughly divided into the "classical" belt and the resonances.
Resonances are orbits linked to that of Neptune (e.g.
twice for every three Neptune orbits, or once for every two).
The first resonance begins within the orbit of Neptune itself.
The classical belt consists of objects having no resonance with Neptune, and extends from roughly 39.4 AU to 47.7 AU.
Members of the classical Kuiper belt are classified as cubewanos, after the first of their kind to be discovered, , and are still in near primordial, low-eccentricity orbits.
On May 5, 1961 which astronaut became the first American in space aboard "Freedom 7", launched by a Redstone booster on a 15-minute ballistic (suborbital) flight?
Project Mercury (1959–63).Shortly after the Space Race began, an early objective was to get a person into Earth orbit as soon as possible, therefore the simplest spacecraft that could be launched by existing rockets was favored.
U.S. Air Force's Man in Space Soonest program looked at many manned spacecraft designs, ranging from rocket planes like the X-15, to small ballistic space capsules.
By 1958, the space plane concepts were eliminated in favor of the ballistic capsule.When NASA was created that same year, the Air Force program was transferred to it and renamed "Project Mercury".
The first seven astronauts were selected among candidates from the Navy, Air Force and Marine test pilot programs.
On May 5, 1961, astronaut Alan Shepard became the first American in space aboard "Freedom 7", launched by a Redstone booster on a 15-minute ballistic (suborbital) flight.
John Glenn became the first American to be launched into orbit by an Atlas launch vehicle on February 20, 1962 aboard "Friendship 7".
Glenn completed three orbits, after which three more orbital flights were made, culminating in L. Gordon Cooper's 22-orbit flight "Faith 7", May 15–16, 1963.The Soviet Union (USSR) competed with its own single-pilot spacecraft, Vostok.
They beat the U.S. for the first man in space, by launching cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into a single Earth orbit aboard Vostok 1 in April 1961, one month before Shepard's flight.
In August 1962, they achieved an almost four-day record flight with Andriyan Nikolayev aboard Vostok 3, and also conducted a concurrent Vostok 4 mission carrying Pavel Popovich.
What does mRNA carry?
Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries information about a protein sequence to the ribosomes, the protein synthesis factories in the cell.
It is coded so that every three nucleotides (a codon) correspond to one amino acid.
In eukaryotic cells, once precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) has been transcribed from DNA, it is processed to mature mRNA.
This removes its introns—non-coding sections of the pre-mRNA.
The mRNA is then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is bound to ribosomes and translated into its corresponding protein form with the help of tRNA.
In prokaryotic cells, which do not have nucleus and cytoplasm compartments, mRNA can bind to ribosomes while it is being transcribed from DNA.
After a certain amount of time the message degrades into its component nucleotides with the assistance of ribonucleases.Transfer RNA (tRNA) is a small RNA chain of about 80 nucleotides that transfers a specific amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during translation.
It has sites for amino acid attachment and an anticodon region for codon recognition that binds to a specific sequence on the messenger RNA chain through hydrogen bonding.Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is the catalytic component of the ribosomes.
Eukaryotic ribosomes contain four different rRNA molecules: 18S, 5.8S, 28S and 5S rRNA.
Three of the rRNA molecules are synthesized in the nucleolus, and one is synthesized elsewhere.
In the cytoplasm, ribosomal RNA and protein combine to form a nucleoprotein called a ribosome.
The ribosome binds mRNA and carries out protein synthesis.
Several ribosomes may be attached to a single mRNA at any time.
Nearly all the RNA found in a typical eukaryotic cell is rRNA.Transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) is found in many bacteria and plastids.
It tags proteins encoded by mRNAs that lack stop codons for degradation and prevents the ribosome from stalling.
What type of virus was recreated in 1918 in laboratories?
The ability of viruses to cause devastating epidemics in human societies has led to the concern that viruses could be weaponised for biological warfare.
Further concern was raised by the successful recreation of the infamous 1918 influenza virus in a laboratory.
The smallpox virus devastated numerous societies throughout history before its eradication.
There are only two centers in the world that are authorized by the WHO to keep stocks of smallpox virus: the Vector Institute in Russia and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States.
However fears that it may be used as a weapon may not be totally unfounded.
As the vaccine for smallpox sometimes had severe side-effects, it is no longer used routinely in any country.
Thus, much of the modern human population has almost no established resistance to smallpox, and would be vulnerable to the virus.
what are pathogens?
If bacteria form a parasitic association with other organisms, they are classed as pathogens.
Pathogenic bacteria are a major cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, foodborne illness, leprosy and tuberculosis.
A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after, as was the case with "Helicobacter pylori" and peptic ulcer disease.
Bacterial diseases are also important in agriculture, with bacteria causing leaf spot, fire blight and wilts in plants, as well as Johne's disease, mastitis, salmonella and anthrax in farm animals.Each species of pathogen has a characteristic spectrum of interactions with its human hosts.
Some organisms, such as "Staphylococcus" or "Streptococcus", can cause skin infections, pneumonia, meningitis and even overwhelming sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response producing shock, massive vasodilation and death.
Yet these organisms are also part of the normal human flora and usually exist on the skin or in the nose without causing any disease at all.
Other organisms invariably cause disease in humans, such as the Rickettsia, which are obligate intracellular parasites able to grow and reproduce only within the cells of other organisms.
One species of Rickettsia causes typhus, while another causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
"Chlamydia", another phylum of obligate intracellular parasites, contains species that can cause pneumonia, or urinary tract infection and may be involved in coronary heart disease.
Finally, some species such as "Pseudomonas aeruginosa", "Burkholderia cenocepacia", and "Mycobacterium avium" are opportunistic pathogens and cause disease mainly in people suffering from immunosuppression or cystic fibrosis.Bacterial infections may be treated with antibiotics, which are classified as bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria, or bacteriostatic if they just prevent bacterial growth.
There are many types of antibiotics and each class inhibits a process that is different in the pathogen from that found in the host.
An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are chloramphenicol and puromycin, which inhibit the bacterial ribosome, but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome.
Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations.
Infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as sterilizing the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters.
Surgical and dental instruments are also sterilized to prevent contamination by bacteria.
Disinfectants such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection.
What are two yeasts that have been found living between people's toes?
Yeasts are very common in the environment, and are often isolated from sugar-rich materials.
Examples include naturally occurring yeasts on the skins of fruits and berries (such as grapes, apples, or peaches), and exudates from plants (such as plant saps or cacti).
Some yeasts are found in association with soil and insects.
The ecological function and biodiversity of yeasts are relatively unknown compared to those of other microorganisms.
Yeasts, including "Candida albicans", "Rhodotorula rubra", "Torulopsis" and "Trichosporon cutaneum", have been found living in between people's toes as part of their skin flora.
Yeasts are also present in the gut flora of mammals and some insects and even deep-sea environments host an array of yeasts.An Indian study of seven bee species and 9 plant species found 45 species from 16 genera colonise the nectaries of flowers and honey stomachs of bees.
Most were members of the "Candida" genus; the most common species in honey stomachs was "Dekkera intermedia" and in flower nectaries, "Candida blankii".
Yeast colonising nectaries of the stinking hellebore have been found to raise the temperature of the flower, which may aid in attracting pollinators by increasing the evaporation of volatile organic compounds.
A black yeast has been recorded as a partner in a complex relationship between ants, their mutualistic fungus, a fungal parasite of the fungus and a bacterium that kills the parasite.
The yeast has a negative effect on the bacteria that normally produce antibiotics to kill the parasite, so may affect the ants' health by allowing the parasite to spread.
What is the most common type of microscope?
The most common type of microscope (and the first invented) is the optical microscope.
This is an optical instrument containing one or more lenses producing an enlarged image of a sample placed in the focal plane.
Optical microscopes have refractive glass and occasionally of plastic or quartz, to focus light into the eye or another light detector.
Mirror-based optical microscopes operate in the same manner.
Typical magnification of a light microscope, assuming visible range light, is up to 1250x with a theoretical resolution limit of around 0.250 micrometres or 250 nanometres.
This limits the practical magnification limit to ~1500x.
Specialized techniques (e.g., scanning confocal microscopy, Vertico SMI) may exceed this magnification but the resolution is diffraction limited.
The use of shorter wavelengths of light, such as the ultraviolet, is one way to improve the spatial resolution of the optical microscope, as are devices such as the near-field scanning optical microscope.Sarfus, a recent optical technique increases the sensitivity of standard optical microscope to a point it becomes possible to directly visualize nanometric films (down to 0.3 nanometre) and isolated nano-objects (down to 2 nm-diameter).
The technique is based on the use of non-reflecting substrates for cross-polarized reflected light microscopy.Ultraviolet light enables the resolution of microscopic features, as well as to image samples that are transparent to the eye.
Near infrared light can be used to visualize circuitry embedded in bonded silicon devices, since silicon is transparent in this region of wavelengths.In fluorescence microscopy, many wavelengths of light, ranging from the ultraviolet to the visible can be used to cause samples to fluoresce to allow viewing by eye or with the use of specifically sensitive cameras.Phase contrast microscopy is an optical microscopy illumination technique in which small phase shifts in the light passing through a transparent specimen are converted into amplitude or contrast changes in the image.The use of phase contrast does not require staining to view the slide.
This microscope technique made it possible to study the cell cycle in live cells.The traditional optical microscope has more recently evolved into the digital microscope.
In addition to, or instead of, directly viewing the object through the eyepieces, a type of sensor similar to those used in a digital camera is used to obtain an image, which is then displayed on a computer monitor.
These sensors may use CMOS or charge-coupled device (CCD) technology, depending on the application.
What is an example of a gamma ray telescope?
Higher energy X-ray and Gamma-ray telescopes refrain from focusing completely and use coded aperture masks: the patterns of the shadow the mask creates can be reconstructed to form an image.X-ray and Gamma-ray telescopes are usually on Earth-orbiting satellites or high-flying balloons since the Earth's atmosphere is opaque to this part of the electromagnetic spectrum.
However, high energy X-rays and gamma-rays do not form an image in the same way as telescopes at visible wavelengths.
An example of this type of telescope is the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.The detection of very high energy gamma rays, with shorter wavelength and higher frequency than regular gamma rays, requires further specialization.
An example of this type of observatory is VERITAS.
Very high energy gamma-rays are still photons, like visible light, whereas cosmic rays includes particles like electrons, protons, and heavier nuclei.A discovery in 2012 may allow focusing gamma-ray telescopes.
At photon energies greater than 700 keV, the index of refraction starts to increase again.
Black holes are often referred to as what after Karl Schwarzschild who discovered this solution in 1916?
The simplest static black holes have mass but neither electric charge nor angular momentum.
These black holes are often referred to as Schwarzschild black holes after Karl Schwarzschild who discovered this solution in 1916.
According to Birkhoff's theorem, it is the only vacuum solution that is spherically symmetric.
This means that there is no observable difference between the gravitational field of such a black hole and that of any other spherical object of the same mass.
The popular notion of a black hole "sucking in everything" in its surroundings is therefore only correct near a black hole's horizon; far away, the external gravitational field is identical to that of any other body of the same mass.Solutions describing more general black holes also exist.
Charged black holes are described by the Reissner–Nordström metric, while the Kerr metric describes a rotating black hole.
The most general stationary black hole solution known is the Kerr–Newman metric, which describes a black hole with both charge and angular momentum.While the mass of a black hole can take any positive value, the charge and angular momentum are constrained by the mass.
In Planck units, the total electric charge "Q" and the total angular momentum "J" are expected to satisfy
formula_1
for a black hole of mass "M".
Black holes saturating this inequality are called extremal.
Solutions of Einstein's equations that violate this inequality exist, but they do not possess an event horizon.
These solutions have so-called naked singularities that can be observed from the outside, and hence are deemed "unphysical".
The cosmic censorship hypothesis rules out the formation of such singularities, when they are created through the gravitational collapse of realistic matter.
This is supported by numerical simulations.Due to the relatively large strength of the electromagnetic force, black holes forming from the collapse of stars are expected to retain the nearly neutral charge of the star.
Rotation, however, is expected to be a common feature of compact objects.
The black-hole candidate binary X-ray source GRS 1915+105 appears to have an angular momentum near the maximum allowed value.Black holes are commonly classified according to their mass, independent of angular momentum "J" or electric charge "Q".
The size of a black hole, as determined by the radius of the event horizon, or Schwarzschild radius, is roughly proportional to the mass "M" through
formula_2
where "r"sh is the Schwarzschild radius and "MSun" is the mass of the Sun.
This relation is exact only for black holes with zero charge and angular momentum; for more general black holes it can differ up to a factor of 2.

What color is the most common of all auroras?
l mechanism.Auroras are associated with the solar wind, a flow of ions continuously flowing outward from the Sun.
The Earth's magnetic field traps these particles, many of which travel toward the poles where they are accelerated toward Earth.
Collisions between these ions and atmospheric atoms and molecules cause energy releases in the form of auroras appearing in large circles around the poles.
Auroras are more frequent and brighter during the intense phase of the solar cycle when coronal mass ejections increase the intensity of the solar wind.Auroras result from emissions of photons in the Earth's upper atmosphere, above , from ionized nitrogen molecules regaining an electron, and oxygen atoms and nitrogen molecules returning from an excited state to ground state.
They are ionized or excited by the collision of solar wind and magnetospheric particles being funneled down and accelerated along the Earth's magnetic field lines; excitation energy is lost by the emission of a photon, or by collision with another atom or molecule:
oxygen emissions: green or brownish-red, depending on the amount of energy absorbed.
nitrogen emissions: blue or red; blue if the atom regains an electron after it has been ionized, red if returning to ground state from an excited state.
Oxygen is unusual in terms of its return to ground state: it can take three quarters of a second to emit green light and up to two minutes to emit red.
Collisions with other atoms or molecules absorb the excitation energy and prevent emission.
Because the very top of the atmosphere has a higher percentage of oxygen and is sparsely distributed such collisions are rare enough to allow time for oxygen to emit red.
Collisions become more frequent progressing down into the atmosphere, so that red emissions do not have time to happen, and eventually even green light emissions are prevented.This is why there is a color differential with altitude; at high altitude oxygen red dominates, then oxygen green and nitrogen blue/red, then finally nitrogen blue/red when collisions prevent oxygen from emitting anything.
Green is the most common of all auroras.
Behind it is pink, a mixture of light green and red, followed by pure red, yellow (a mixture of red and green), and finally, pure blue.
How are Tacos Sudados made
There are many traditional varieties of tacos:
 Tacos de Asador ("spit" or "grill" tacos) may be composed of any of the following: "carne asada tacos"; tacos de tripita ("tripe tacos"), grilled until crisp; and, "chorizo asado" (traditional Spanish style sausage).
Each type is served on two overlapped small tortillas and sometimes garnished with guacamole, salsa, onions, and cilantro.
Also prepared on the grill is a sandwiched taco called "mulita" ("little mule") made with meat served between two tortillas and garnished with Oaxaca style cheese.
""Mulita"" is used to describe these types of sandwiched tacos in the Northern States of Mexico, while they are known as Gringa in the Mexican south and are prepared using wheat flour tortillas.
Tacos may also be served with salsa.
 Tacos de Cabeza or head tacos, in which there is a flat punctured metal plate from which steam emerges to cook the head of the cow.
These include: "Cabeza", a serving of the muscles of the head; "Sesos" ("brains"); "Lengua" ("tongue"); "Cachete" ("cheeks"); "Trompa" ("lips"); and, "Ojo" ("eye").
Tortillas for these tacos are warmed on the same steaming plate for a different consistency.
These tacos are typically served in pairs, and also include salsa, onion and cilantro with occasional use of guacamole.
 Tacos de Cazo for which a metal bowl filled with lard is typically used as a deep-fryer.
Meats for these types of tacos typically include: "Tripa" ("tripe", usually from a pig instead of a cow); "Suadero" (tender beef cuts), "Carnitas" and "Buche" (Literally, ""crop"", as in "bird's crop"; here, it is fried pig's esophagus.
)
 Tacos sudados ("sweaty tacos") are made by filling soft tortillas with a spicy meat mixture, then placing them in a basket covered with cloth.
The covering keeps the tacos warm and traps steam ("sweat") which softens them.
 Tacos Al pastor/De Adobada ("shepherd style") are made of thin pork steaks seasoned with adobo seasoning, then skewered and overlapped on one another on a vertical rotisserie cooked and flame-broiled as it spins.
 Tacos dorados (fried tacos, literally, "golden tacos") called "flauta"s ("flute", because of the shape), or taquitos, for which the tortillas are filled with pre-cooked shredded chicken, beef or "barbacoa", rolled into an elongated cylinder and deep-fried until crisp.
They are sometimes cooked in a microwave oven or broiled.
 Tacos de pescado ("fish tacos") originated in Baja California in Mexico, where they consist of grilled or fried fish, lettuce or cabbage, pico de gallo, and a sour cream or citrus/mayonnaise sauce, all placed on top of a corn or flour tortilla.
In the United States, they were first popularized by the Rubio's fast-food chain, and remain most popular in California, Colorado, and Washington.
In California, they are often found at street vendors, and a regional variation is to serve them with cabbage and coleslaw dressing on top.
 Tacos de camarones ("shrimp tacos") also originated in Baja California in Mexico.
Grilled or fried shrimp are used, usually with the same accompaniments as fish tacos: lettuce or cabbage, pico de gallo, avocado and a sour cream or citrus/mayonnaise sauce, all placed on top of a corn or flour tortilla.
As an accompaniment to tacos, many taco stands will serve whole or sliced red radishes, lime slices, salt, pickled or grilled chilis (hot peppers), and occasionally cucumber slices, or grilled cambray onions.
At which county fair did Frank and Charles Mences claim to sell the first hamburger?
Another claim from 1885 comes from Frank and Charles Menches who claim to have sold a ground beef sandwich at the Erie County Fair in Hamburg, New York.
During the fair, they ran out of pork sausage for their sandwiches and substituted beef.
Kunzog, who spoke to Frank Menches, says they exhausted their supply of sausage, so purchased chopped up beef from a butcher, Andrew Klein.
Though historian Joseph Streamer wrote that the meat was from Stein's market not Klein's; despite Stein having sold the market in 1874.
The story notes that the origin of the hamburger comes from Hamburg, New York not Hamburg Germany.
Yet Frank Menches's obituary in "The New York Times" states that these events took place at the 1892 Summit County Fair in Akron, Ohio.
When was French Fried Potatoes first used?
In France and other French-speaking countries, fried potatoes are formally "pommes de terre frites", but more commonly "pommes frites", "patates frites", or simply "frites".
The word ""aiguillettes"" or "allumettes" is used when the chips are very small and thin.One enduring origin story holds that French Fries were invented by street vendors on the Pont Neuf bridge in Paris in 1789, just before the outbreak of the French revolution.
Eating potatoes was promoted in France by Parmentier, but he did not mention fried potatoes in particular.Many Americans attribute the dish to France and offer as evidence a notation by U.S. President Thomas Jefferson.
""Pommes de terre frites à cru, en petites tranches"" ("Potatoes deep-fried while raw, in small cuttings") in a manuscript in Thomas Jefferson's hand (circa 1801–1809) and the recipe almost certainly comes from his French chef, Honoré Julien.In addition, from 1813 on, recipes for what can be described as French fries occur in popular American cookbooks.
By the late 1850s, one of these uses the term "French fried potatoes".
"Frites" are the main ingredient in the Canadian dish of Québécois descent known in both Canadian English and French as poutine, consisting of fried potatoes covered with cheese curds and gravy, a dish with a growing number of variations.
What is the most common type of sausage that could be classified as chorizo?
"Longaniza" is the most common type of sausage, or at least the most common name in Chile for sausages that also could be classified as chorizo.
The Chilean variety is made of four parts pork to one part bacon (or less) and seasoned with finely ground garlic, salt, pepper, cumin, oregano, paprika and chilli sauce.
The cities of Chillán and San Carlos are known among Chileans for having the best "longanizas".Another traditional sausage is the "prieta", the Chilean version of blood sausage, generally known elsewhere in Latin America as "morcilla".
In Chile, it contains onions, spices and sometimes walnut or rice and is usually eaten at "asados" or accompanied by simple boiled potatoes.
It sometimes has a very thick skin so is cut open lengthwise before eating.
"Vienesa"s or Vienna sausages are also very common and are mainly used in the "completo", the Chilean version of the hot dog.
How is peameal bacon made?
An individual piece of bacon is a 'slice' or 'strip'.
In Canada:
 The term bacon on its own or, more specifically, side bacon typically refers to bacon from the pig's belly.
 Back bacon refers to either smoked or unsmoked bacon cut from the boneless eye of pork loin; this is called 'Canadian bacon' in the United States.
 Peameal bacon is back bacon, brined and coated in fine cornmeal (historically, it was rolled in a meal made from ground dried peas).
Who introduced the kebob in Norway during the 1980's?
In Norway, the kebab was introduced by Pakistani and Turkish immigrants during the 1980s.
The kebab has become a symbol of immigration from the Muslim world, and speaking Norwegian with an Arab accent or with a lot of words and expressions borrowed from the Pakistani, Turkish, Arabic, and Persian languages is sometimes referred to as "Kebabnorsk" (Kebab Norwegian).The kebabs in Norway are served in a variety of ways, commonly in fast-food shops selling both hamburgers and kebabs.
The kebab roll has become increasingly popular, with the kebab not served in pita bread, but rather wrapped in pizza dough (making it look like a spring roll) for easy consumption.
The most "Norwegian" kebab to date is probably the whalemeat kebab sold at the Inferno Metal Festival.
As of 2008, the average price of the kebab in Norway lies around 65 kroner, or about €8.
In Bergen the average price of a kebab is around 50 kr.
In Bergen kebab is most commonly served in the dürüm variety, with two types of sauces, one standard and one optional hot chili variety.The Norwegian Food Safety Authority in 2007 issued a warning about cheap kebabs.
According to "Verdens Gang" they estimated that more than 80% of kebab shops in Oslo use illegally produced meat.
It was warned that such meat could be dangerous to eat because it could contain salmonella or other bacteria, and that it could be connected to organised crime.
What kind of flavor does miso ramen broth have?
Ramen soup is generally made from stock based on chicken or pork, combined with a variety of ingredients such as kombu (kelp), katsuobushi (skipjack tuna flakes), niboshi (dried baby sardines), beef bones, shiitake, and onions, and then flavored with salt, miso, or soy sauce.
Other styles that have emerged later on include curry ramen and other flavors.The resulting combination is generally divided into four categories (although new and original variations often make this categorisation less clear-cut):
 Shio ("salt") ramen is probably the oldest of the four and is a pale, clear, yellowish broth made with plenty of salt and any combination of chicken, vegetables, fish, and seaweed.
Occasionally pork bones are also used, but they are not boiled as long as they are for "tonkotsu" ramen, so the soup remains light and clear.
Chāshū is sometimes swapped for lean chicken meatballs, and pickled plums and kamaboko (a slice of processed fish roll sometimes served as a frilly white circle with a pink or red spiral called narutomaki) are popular toppings as well.
Noodle texture and thickness varies among "shio" ramen, but they are usually straight rather than curly.
 (豚骨, "pork bone"; not to be confused with tonkatsu) ramen usually has a cloudy white colored broth.
It is similar to the Chinese "baitang" (白湯) and has a thick broth made from boiling pork bones, fat, and collagen over high heat for many hours, which suffuses the broth with a hearty pork flavor and a creamy consistency that rivals milk, melted butter or gravy (depending on the shop).
Most shops, but not all, blend this pork broth with a small amount of chicken and vegetable stock and/or soy sauce.
The noodles are thin and straight, and it is often served with beni shoga (pickled ginger).
In recent years the latest trend in "tonkotsu" toppings is "māyu" (sesame oil), a blackish, aromatic oil made from either charred crushed garlic or Sesame seeds.
It is a specialty of Kyushu, particularly Hakata-ku, Fukuoka (hence sometimes called "Hakata ramen").
Shōyu ("soy sauce") ramen typically has a clear brown broth, based on a chicken and vegetable (or sometimes fish or beef) stock with plenty of soy sauce added resulting in a soup that is tangy, salty, and savory yet still fairly light on the palate.
Shōyu ramen usually has curly noodles rather than straight ones, but this is not always the case.
It is often adorned with marinated bamboo shoots or "menma", green onions, "kamaboko" (fish cakes), "nori" (seaweed), boiled eggs, bean sprouts and/or black pepper; occasionally the soup will also contain chili oil or Chinese spices, and some shops serve sliced beef instead of the usual chāshū.
 Miso ramen is a relative newcomer, having reached national prominence around 1965.
This uniquely Japanese ramen, which was developed in Hokkaido, features a broth that combines copious amounts of miso and is blended with oily chicken or fish broth – and sometimes with "tonkotsu" or lard – to create a thick, nutty, slightly sweet and very hearty soup.
Miso ramen broth tends to have a robust, tangy flavor, so it stands up to a variety of flavorful toppings: spicy bean paste or "tōbanjan" (豆瓣醤), butter and corn, leeks, onions, bean sprouts, ground pork, cabbage, sesame seeds, white pepper, and chopped garlic are common.
The noodles are typically thick, curly, and slightly chewy.
Seasonings commonly added to ramen are black pepper, butter, chili pepper, sesame seeds, and crushed garlic.
Soup recipes and methods of preparation tend to be closely guarded secrets.Some restaurants also offer a system known as "kae-dama" (替え玉), where customers who have finished their noodles can request a "refill" (for a few hundred yen more) to be put into their remaining soup.
What is the broth?
There are wide variations in both thickness and shape for udon noodles.
 Inaniwa udon (稲庭うどん): a thin type from Akita Prefecture.
 Mimi udon (耳うどん, literally "ear udon"): a lucky preserved food in Kuzu, Tochigi.
It looks similar to ears.
 Himokawa (ひもかわ): an extreme flat and wide type from Kiryū, Gunma.
 Hōtō (rarely 餺飥, commonly ほうとう): a flat and wide type, usually cooked with vegetables, particularly Japanese "kabocha" squash, from Yamanashi Prefecture.
 Kishimen (棊子麺, or more commonly きし麺): a flat type from the Nagoya.
 Ise udon (伊勢うどん): a soft type, usually eaten with sweet soy sauce, from Ise, Mie.
 In Kansai region, a soft and medium thickness type is popular.
 Sanuki udon (讃岐うどん): a thick and rather stiff type from Kagawa Prefecture.
 Hakata udon (博多うどん): a thick and soft type from the Fukuoka.
 Dango-jiru (団子汁): similar to the above "Hohtoh", from Ōita Prefecture.
Nominally a "dumpling soup", it resembles very thick, flat udon.
 Okinawa soba (沖縄そば): also called "suba", a regional Okinawan noodle made by adding some vegetal ash to the flour, similar to how ramen is made.
However, it is very similar to udon.
 There is also a dish called "udon" in Palau, because of the former Japanese administration.
The broth is soy sauce–based like Japanese udon.
However, as there were many immigrants from Okinawa, it uses less broth like Okinawa soba.
Most notably, the noodle is that of spaghetti, as it is easier to acquire there.
Consumption of which types of rice reduce the progression of atherosclerotic plaque development?
Nutrition and health.Nutrients and the nutritional importance of rice.Rice is the staple food of over half the world's population.
It is the predominant dietary energy source for 17 countries in Asia and the Pacific, 9 countries in North and South America and 8 countries in Africa.
Rice provides 20% of the world’s dietary energy supply, while wheat supplies 19% and maize (corn) 5%.A detailed analysis of nutrient content of rice suggests that the nutrition value of rice varies based on a number of factors.
It depends on the strain of rice, that is between white, brown, black, red and purple varieties of rice – each prevalent in different parts of the world.
It also depends on nutrient quality of the soil rice is grown in, whether and how the rice is polished or processed, the manner it is enriched, and how it is prepared before consumption.An illustrative comparison between white and brown rice of protein quality, mineral and vitamin quality, carbohydrate and fat quality suggests that neither is a complete nutrition source.
Between the two, there is a significant difference in fiber content and minor differences in other nutrients.Brilliantly colored rice strains, such as purple rice, derive their color from anthocyanins and tocols.
Scientific studies suggest that these color pigments have antioxidant properties that may be useful to human health.
In purple rice bran, hydrophilic antioxidants are in greater quantity and have higher free radical scavenging activity than lipophilic antioxidants.
Anthocyanins and γ-tocols in purple rice are largely located in the inner portion of purple rice bran.Comparative nutrition studies on red, black and white varieties of rice suggest that pigments in red and black rice varieties may offer nutritional benefits.
Red or black rice consumption was found to reduce or retard the progression of atherosclerotic plaque development, induced by dietary cholesterol, in mammals.
White rice consumption offered no similar benefits, and the study claims this to be due to absent antioxidants in red and black varieties of rice.
From what part of a cow is a skirt steak cut?
A skirt steak is a part of the plate (situated at the cow's abdomen), the steak is long, thick and tender and it is usually priced by its flavour rather than the tenderness because its flavour is better than its tenderness.
Skirt steaks are not to be confused with flank steaks because they are near the sirloin and shank.
Skirt steaks are used in many international cuisines: Mexican cuisine use this steak for fajitas and arrachera.
In the United Kingdom it is often used as filling for Cornish pasties as well as vegetables such as carrot and potato.
In Chinese cuisine it is used for stir-fries, in Spanish cuisine the steak is made for churrasco and Italian cuisine use skirt steak for making bolognese sauce as well as with tomatoes.
What are Bound salads assembled with?
A "bound" salad can be composed (arranged) or tossed (put in a bowl and mixed with a thick dressing).
They are assembled with thick sauces such as mayonnaise.
One portion of a true bound salad will hold its shape when placed on a plate with an ice-cream scoop.
Examples of bound salad include tuna salad, pasta salad, chicken salad, egg salad, and potato salad.Bound salads are often used as sandwich fillings.
They are popular at picnics and barbecues, because they can be made ahead of time and refrigerated.
What's another way in which popcorn is referred to as?
Popcorn, also known as popping corn, is a type of corn (maize, "Zea mays var.
everta") that expands from the kernel and puffs up when heated.
Popcorn is able to pop because, like amaranth grain, sorghum, quinoa, and millet, its kernels have a hard moisture-sealed hull and a dense starchy interior.
Pressure builds inside the kernel, and a small explosion (or "pop") is the end result.
Some strains of corn are now cultivated specifically as popping corns.There are various techniques for popping corn.
Along with prepackaged popcorn, which is generally intended to be prepared in a microwave oven, there are small home appliances for popping corn.
These methods require the use of minimally processed popping corn.A larger-scale, commercial popcorn machine was invented by Charles Cretors in the late 19th century.Unpopped popcorn is considered nonperishable and will last indefinitely if stored in ideal conditions.Depending on how it is prepared and cooked, some consider popcorn to be a health food, while others caution against it for a variety of reasons.
Popcorn can also have non-food applications, ranging from holiday decorations to packaging materials.
What is "confarreatio"?
Cakes may be classified according to the occasion for which they are intended.
For example, wedding cakes, birthday cakes, cakes for first communion, Christmas cakes, Halloween cakes and Passover plava (a type of sponge cake sometimes made with matzo meal) are all identified primarily according to the celebration they are intended to accompany.
The cutting of a wedding cake constitutes a social ceremony in some cultures.
The Ancient Roman marriage ritual of "confarreatio" originated in the sharing of a cake.Particular types of cake may be associated with particular festivals, such as stollen or chocolate log (at Christmas), babka and simnel cake (at Easter), or mooncake.
There has been a long tradition of decorating an iced cake at Christmas time; other cakes associated with Christmas include chocolate log and mince pies.
What year did Frederic Tudor build his first ice cream factory?
Before the development of modern refrigeration, ice cream was a luxury reserved for special occasions.
Making it was quite laborious; ice was cut from lakes and ponds during the winter and stored in holes in the ground, or in wood-frame or brick ice houses, insulated by straw.
Many farmers and plantation owners, including U.S. Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, cut and stored ice in the winter for use in the summer.
Frederic Tudor of Boston turned ice harvesting and shipping into a big business, cutting ice in New England and shipping it around the world.Ice cream was made by hand in a large bowl placed inside a tub filled with ice and salt.
This was called the pot-freezer method.
French confectioners refined the pot-freezer method, making ice cream in a sorbetière (a covered pail with a handle attached to the lid).
In the pot-freezer method, the temperature of the ingredients is reduced by the mixture of crushed ice and salt.
The salt water is cooled by the ice, and the action of the salt on the ice causes it to (partially) melt, absorbing latent heat and bringing the mixture below the freezing point of pure water.
The immersed container can also make better thermal contact with the salty water and ice mixture than it could with ice alone.The hand-cranked churn, which also uses ice and salt for cooling, replaced the pot-freezer method.
The exact origin of the hand-cranked freezer is unknown, but the first U.S. patent for one was #3254 issued to Nancy Johnson on September 9, 1843.
The hand-cranked churn produced smoother ice cream than the pot freezer and did it quicker.
Many inventors patented improvements on Johnson's design.In Europe and early America, ice cream was made and sold by small businesses, mostly confectioners and caterers.
Jacob Fussell of Baltimore, Maryland was the first to manufacture ice cream on a large scale.
Fussell bought fresh dairy products from farmers in York County, Pennsylvania, and sold them in Baltimore.
An unstable demand for his dairy products often left him with a surplus of cream, which he made into ice cream.
He built his first ice cream factory in Seven Valleys, Pennsylvania, in 1851.
Two years later, he moved his factory to Baltimore.
Later, he opened factories in several other cities and taught the business to others, who operated their own plants.
Mass production reduced the cost of ice cream and added to its popularity.The development of industrial refrigeration by German engineer Carl von Linde during the 1870s eliminated the need to cut and store natural ice, and, when the continuous-process freezer was perfected in 1926, commercial mass production of ice cream and the birth of the modern ice cream industry was underway.The most common method for producing ice cream at home is to use an ice cream maker, in modern times, in general, an electrical device that churns the ice cream mixture while cooled inside a household freezer, or using a solution of pre-frozen salt and water, which gradually melts while the ice cream freezes.
Some more expensive models have an inbuilt freezing element.
A newer method of making home-made ice cream is to add liquid nitrogen to the mixture while stirring it using a spoon or spatula for a few seconds; a similar technique, advocated by Heston Blumenthal as ideal for home cooks, is to add dry ice to the mixture while stirring for a few minutes.
Some ice cream recipes call for making a custard, folding in whipped cream, and immediately freezing the mixture.
what is strained yogurt strained through?
Strained yogurt is yogurt which has been strained through a paper or cloth filter, traditionally made of muslin., to remove the whey, giving a much thicker consistency and a distinctive, slightly tangy taste.
Strained yogurt is becoming more popular with those who make yogurt at home, especially if using skim milk which results in a thinner consistency.
Once yogurt is made and refrigerated overnight, it is poured in a muslin or cheesecloth bag and hung in the coolest place in the house, with a tub placed underneath to collect the dripping whey.
In cold weather a single day (or night) of straining is sufficient.
In higher ambient temperatures yogurt will spoil rapidly, therefore it had best be actively squeezed or strained until about a third or more of its initial weight has run off.
The remainder is now strained and is refrigerated again.Labneh is a strained yogurt used for sandwiches popular in Arab countries.
Olive oil, cucumber slices, olives, and various green herbs may be added.
It can be thickened further and rolled into balls, preserved in olive oil, and fermented for a few more weeks.
It is sometimes used with onions, meat, and nuts as a stuffing for a variety of pies or kebbeh (كبة) balls.Some types of strained yogurts are boiled in open vats first, so that the liquid content is reduced.
The popular East Indian dessert, a variation of traditional dahi called mishti dahi, offers a thicker, more custard-like consistency, and is usually sweeter than western yogurts.Strained yogurt is also enjoyed in Greece and is the main component of "tzatziki" (from Turkish "cacık"), a well-known accompaniment to gyros and souvlaki pita sandwiches: it is a yogurt sauce or dip made with the addition of grated cucumber, olive oil, salt and, optionally, mashed garlic.Srikhand, a popular dessert in India, is made from strained yogurt, saffron, cardamom, nutmeg and sugar and sometimes fruits such as mango or pineapple.In North America and Britain, strained yogurt is commonly called "Greek yogurt".
What is the most common cheese in Iceland?
Worldwide, cheese is a major agricultural product.
According to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, over 20 million metric tons of cheese were produced worldwide in 2011.
This is about three kilograms for each person on Earth.
The largest producer of cheese is the United States, accounting for 26% of world production, followed by Germany and France.
In the U.S., mozzarella and cheddar are by far the top cheese types.
Only Ireland, New Zealand, the Netherlands and Australia have a cheese production that is mainly export oriented: respectively 95%, 90%, 72%, and 65% of their cheese production is exported.
Only 35% of French production is exported.
The United States, the biggest world producer of cheese, is a marginal exporter, as most of its production is for the domestic market.Emmental (used mainly as a cooking ingredient) and Camembert are the most common cheeses in France.
In Iceland, skyr is the most common cheese.
In Greece, feta accounts for three-quarters of this consumption.
In the U.S., the consumption of cheese is quickly increasing and has nearly tripled between 1970 and 2003.
The consumption per person has reached, in 2003, .
Mozzarella is United States's favorite cheese and accounts for nearly a third of its consumption, mainly because it is one of the main ingredients of pizza.
What state is Coffee sold in?
The next step in the process is the roasting of the green coffee.
Coffee is usually sold in a roasted state, and with rare exceptions all coffee is roasted before it is consumed.
It can be sold roasted by the supplier, or it can be home roasted.
The roasting process influences the taste of the beverage by changing the coffee seed both physically and chemically.
The seed decreases in weight as moisture is lost and increases in volume, causing it to become less dense.
The density of the seed also influences the strength of the coffee and requirements for packaging.The actual roasting begins when the temperature inside the seed reaches approximately , though different varieties of seeds differ in moisture and density and therefore roast at different rates.
During roasting, caramelization occurs as intense heat breaks down starches, changing them to simple sugars that begin to brown, which alters the color of the seed.Sucrose is rapidly lost during the roasting process and may disappear entirely in darker roasts.
During roasting, aromatic oils and acids weaken, changing the flavor; at , other oils start to develop.
One of these oils, caffeol, is created at about , which is largely responsible for coffee's aroma and flavor.
What meal are juices most often enjoyed with?
Juice is prepared by mechanically squeezing or macerating fruit or vegetable flesh without the application of heat or solvents.
For example, orange juice is the liquid extract of the fruit of the orange tree, and tomato juice is the liquid that results from pressing the fruit of the tomato plant.
Juice may be prepared in the home from fresh fruit and vegetables using a variety of hand or electric juicers.
Juice is one of the most popular drinks to go with breakfast in the morning.Many commercial juices are filtered to remove fiber or pulp, but high-pulp fresh orange juice is a popular beverage.
Common methods for preservation and processing of fruit juices include canning, pasteurization, concentrating, freezing, evaporation and spray drying.
