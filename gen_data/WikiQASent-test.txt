Perspectives on human cloning are theoretical, as human therapeutic and reproductive cloning are not commercially used; animals are currently cloned in laboratories and in livestock production.Advocates support development of therapeutic cloning in order to generate tissues and whole organs to treat patients who otherwise cannot obtain transplants, to avoid the need for immunosuppressive drugs, and to stave off the effects of aging.	0
What does the ethics of cloning refer to in bioethics?	Advocates for reproductive cloning believe that parents who cannot otherwise procreate should have access to the technology.Opponents of cloning have concerns that technology is not yet developed enough to be safe, that it could be prone to abuse (leading to the generation of humans from whom organs and tissues would be harvested), and have concerns about how cloned individuals could integrate with families and with society at large.Religious groups are divided, with some opposing the technology as usurping God's place and, to the extent embryos are used, destroying a human life; others support therapeutic cloning's potential life-saving benefits.Cloning of animals is opposed by animal-groups due to the number of cloned animals that suffer from malformations before they die, and while food from cloned animals has been approved by the US FDA, its use is opposed by groups concerned about food safety.	0

What is the rate of recombination?	A set of alleles that is usually inherited in a group is called a haplotype.	0
What is the rate of recombination?	This can be important when one allele in a particular haplotype is strongly beneficial: natural selection can drive a selective sweep that will also cause the other alleles in the haplotype to become more common in the population; this effect is called genetic hitchhiking or genetic draft.	0
What is the rate of recombination?	Genetic draft caused by the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection can be partially captured by an appropriate effective population size.	0

What can escape from the inside of an event horizon of a black hole?	The defining feature of a black hole is the appearance of an event horizon—a boundary in spacetime through which matter and light can only pass inward towards the mass of the black hole.	1
What can escape from the inside of an event horizon of a black hole?	Nothing, not even light, can escape from inside the event horizon.	1
What can escape from the inside of an event horizon of a black hole?	The event horizon is referred to as such because if an event occurs within the boundary, information from that event cannot reach an outside observer, making it impossible to determine if such an event occurred.As predicted by general relativity, the presence of a mass deforms spacetime in such a way that the paths taken by particles bend towards the mass.	0
What can escape from the inside of an event horizon of a black hole?	At the event horizon of a black hole, this deformation becomes so strong that there are no paths that lead away from the black hole.To a distant observer, clocks near a black hole appear to tick more slowly than those further away from the black hole.	0
What can escape from the inside of an event horizon of a black hole?	Due to this effect, known as gravitational time dilation, an object falling into a black hole appears to slow down as it approaches the event horizon, taking an infinite time to reach it.	0
What can escape from the inside of an event horizon of a black hole?	At the same time, all processes on this object slow down, for a fixed outside observer, causing emitted light to appear redder and dimmer, an effect known as gravitational redshift.	0
What can escape from the inside of an event horizon of a black hole?	Eventually, at a point just before it reaches the event horizon, the falling object becomes so dim that it can no longer be seen.On the other hand, an indestructible observer falling into a black hole does not notice any of these effects as he crosses the event horizon.	0
What can escape from the inside of an event horizon of a black hole?	According to his own clock, which appears to him to tick normally, he crosses the event horizon after a finite time without noting any singular behaviour.	0
What can escape from the inside of an event horizon of a black hole?	In particular, he is unable to determine exactly when he crosses it, as it is impossible to determine the location of the event horizon from local observations.The shape of the event horizon of a black hole is always approximately spherical.	0

What is the spiral called that is caused by the rotation of the Sun?	The southward (and northward) excursions of Bz are greatest during April and October, when Earth's magnetic dipole axis is most closely aligned with the Parker spiral.Bz is not the only influence on geomagnetic activity, however, the Sun's rotation axis is tilted 8 degrees with respect to the plane of Earth's orbit.	0
What is the spiral called that is caused by the rotation of the Sun?	The solar wind blows more rapidly from the Sun's poles than from its equator, thus the average speed of particles buffeting Earth's magnetosphere waxes and wanes every six months.	0
What is the spiral called that is caused by the rotation of the Sun?	The solar wind speed is greatest – by about 50 km/s, on average – around 5 September and 5 March when Earth lies at its highest heliographic latitude.Still, neither Bz nor the solar wind can fully explain the seasonal behavior of geomagnetic storms.	0
What is the spiral called that is caused by the rotation of the Sun?	Those factors together contribute only about one-third of the observed semiannual variations.	0

They refused to endorse completely all of the ritual directions and formulas of the "Book of Common Prayer"; the imposition of its liturgical order by legal force and inspection sharpened Puritanism into a definite opposition movement.The later Puritan movement were often referred to as dissenters and nonconformists and eventually led to the formation of various reformed denominations.The most famous and well-known emigration to America was the migration of the Puritan separatists from the Anglican Church of England, who fled first to Holland, and then later to America, to establish the English colony of Massachusetts in New England, which later became one of the original United States.These Puritan separatists were also known as "the Pilgrims".	0
What was the Pilgrims' stance on Christmas?	After establishing a colony at Plymouth (which became part of the colony of Massachusetts) in 1620, the Puritan pilgrims received a charter from the King of England that legitimised their colony, allowing them to do trade and commerce with merchants in England, in accordance with the principles of mercantilism.	0
What was the Pilgrims' stance on Christmas?	This successful, though initially quite difficult, colony marked the beginning of the Protestant presence in America (the earlier French, Spanish and Portuguese settlements had been Roman Catholic), and became a kind of oasis of spiritual and economic freedom, to which persecuted Protestants and other minorities from the British Isles and Europe (and later, from all over the world) fled to for peace, freedom and opportunity.	0

What types of mutation are usually selected against?	In addition to being a major source of variation, mutation may also function as a mechanism of evolution when there are different probabilities at the molecular level for different mutations to occur, a process known as mutation bias.	0
What types of mutation are usually selected against?	If two genotypes, for example one with the nucleotide G and another with the nucleotide A in the same position, have the same fitness, but mutation from G to A happens more often than mutation from A to G, then genotypes with A will tend to evolve.	0

Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance?	Some bacteria also transfer genetic material between cells.	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance?	This can occur in three main ways.	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance?	First, bacteria can take up exogenous DNA from their environment, in a process called transformation.	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance?	Genes can also be transferred by the process of transduction, when the integration of a bacteriophage introduces foreign DNA into the chromosome.	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance?	The third method of gene transfer is conjugation, whereby DNA is transferred through direct cell contact.Transduction of bacterial genes by bacteriophage appears to be a consequence of infrequent errors during intracellular assembly of virus particles, rather than a bacterial adaptation.	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance?	Conjugation, in the much-studied E. coli system is determined by plasmid genes, and is an adaptation for transferring copies of the plasmid from one bacterial host to another.	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance?	It is seldom that a conjugative plasmid integrates into the host bacterial chromosome, and subsequently transfers part of the host bacterial DNA to another bacterium.	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance?	Plasmid-mediated transfer of host bacterial DNA also appears to be an accidental process rather than a bacterial adaptation.Transformation, unlike transduction or conjugation, depends on numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact to perform this complex process, and thus transformation is clearly a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer.	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance?	In order for a bacterium to bind, take up and recombine donor DNA into its own chromosome, it must first enter a special physiological state termed competence (see Natural competence).	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance?	In "Bacillus subtilis" about 40 genes are required for the development of competence.	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance?	The length of DNA transferred during "B. subtilis" transformation can be between a third of a chromosome up to the whole chromosome.	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance?	Transformation appears to be common among bacterial species, and thus far at least 60 species are known to have the natural ability to become competent for transformation.	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance?	The development of competence in nature is usually associated with stressful environmental conditions, and seems to be an adaptation for facilitating repair of DNA damage in recipient cells.In ordinary circumstances, transduction, conjugation, and transformation involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria of the same species, but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences, such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance.	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance?	In such cases, gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called horizontal gene transfer and may be common under natural conditions.	0
Why is gene transfer important in antibiotic resistance?	Gene transfer is particularly important in antibiotic resistance as it allows the rapid transfer of resistance genes between different pathogens.	1

What is the first step in the biosynthesis of J?	The nucleobases are classified into two types: the purines, A and G, being fused five- and six-membered heterocyclic compounds, and the pyrimidines, the six-membered rings C and T. A fifth pyrimidine nucleobase, uracil (U), usually takes the place of thymine in RNA and differs from thymine by lacking a methyl group on its ring.	0
What is the first step in the biosynthesis of J?	In addition to RNA and DNA a large number of artificial nucleic acid analogues have also been created to study the properties of nucleic acids, or for use in biotechnology.Uracil is not usually found in DNA, occurring only as a breakdown product of cytosine.	0

When did Last Glacial Maximum happen?	Quantification of climatological variation of precipitation in prior centuries and epochs is less complete but approximated using proxies such as marine sediments, ice cores, cave stalagmites, and tree rings.Climatological temperatures substantially affect precipitation.	0
When did Last Glacial Maximum happen?	For instance, during the Last Glacial Maximum of 18,000 years ago, thermal-driven evaporation from the oceans onto continental landmasses was low, causing large areas of extreme desert, including polar deserts (cold but with low rates of precipitation).	1
When did Last Glacial Maximum happen?	In contrast, the world's climate was wetter than today near the start of the warm Atlantic Period of 8000 years ago.Estimated global land precipitation increased by approximately 2% over the course of the 20th century, though the calculated trend varies if different time endpoints are chosen, complicated by ENSO and other oscillations, including greater global land precipitation in the 1950s and 1970s than the later 1980s and 1990s despite the positive trend over the century overall.Similar slight overall increase in global river runoff and in average soil moisture has been perceived.	0

What does the term clone mean?	As an example, some European cultivars of grapes represent clones that have been propagated for over two millennia.	0
What does the term clone mean?	Other examples are potato and banana.	0
What does the term clone mean?	Grafting can be regarded as cloning, since all the shoots and branches coming from the graft are genetically a clone of a single individual, but this particular kind of cloning has not come under ethical scrutiny and is generally treated as an entirely different kind of operation.Many trees, shrubs, vines, ferns and other herbaceous perennials form clonal colonies naturally.	0
What does the term clone mean?	Parts of an individual plant may become detached by fragmentation and grow on to become separate clonal individuals.	0
What does the term clone mean?	A common example is in the vegetative reproduction of moss and liverwort gametophyte clones by means of gemmae.	0

What characteristic of Mendeleev's periodic table implicitly predicted the properties of elements that had not yet been discovered?	Mendeleev's table was his first published version; that of Meyer was an expanded version of his (Meyer's) table of 1864.	0
What characteristic of Mendeleev's periodic table implicitly predicted the properties of elements that had not yet been discovered?	They both constructed their tables by listing the elements in rows or columns in order of atomic weight and starting a new row or column when the characteristics of the elements began to repeat.The recognition and acceptance afforded to Mendeleev's table came from two decisions he made.	0
What characteristic of Mendeleev's periodic table implicitly predicted the properties of elements that had not yet been discovered?	The first was to leave gaps in the table when it seemed that the corresponding element had not yet been discovered.	1
What characteristic of Mendeleev's periodic table implicitly predicted the properties of elements that had not yet been discovered?	Mendeleev was not the first chemist to do so, but he was the first to be recognized as using the trends in his periodic table to predict the properties of those missing elements, such as gallium and germanium.	1

The second decision was to occasionally ignore the order suggested by the atomic weights and switch adjacent elements, such as tellurium and iodine, to better classify them into chemical families.	0
What characteristic of Mendeleev's periodic table implicitly predicted the properties of elements that had not yet been discovered?	With the development of theories of atomic structure, it became apparent that Mendeleev had unintentionally listed the elements in order of increasing atomic number or nuclear charge.The significance of atomic numbers to the organization of the periodic table was not appreciated until the existence and properties of protons and neutrons became understood.	0
What characteristic of Mendeleev's periodic table implicitly predicted the properties of elements that had not yet been discovered?	Mendeleev's periodic tables used atomic weight instead of atomic number to organize the elements, information determinable to fair precision in his time.	0
What characteristic of Mendeleev's periodic table implicitly predicted the properties of elements that had not yet been discovered?	Atomic weight worked well enough in most cases to (as noted) give a presentation that was able to predict the properties of missing elements more accurately than any other method then known.	0

Substitution of atomic numbers, once understood, gave a definitive, integer-based sequence for the elements, still used today even as new synthetic elements are being produced and studied.	0
What was a problem for classical physics?	Modern physics began in the early 20th century with the work of Max Planck in quantum theory and Albert Einstein's theory of relativity.	0
What was a problem for classical physics?	Both of these theories came about due to inaccuracies in classical mechanics in certain situations.	0
What was a problem for classical physics?	Classical mechanics predicted a varying speed of light, which could not be resolved with the constant speed predicted by Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism; this discrepancy was corrected by Einstein's theory of special relativity, which replaced classical mechanics for fast-moving bodies and allowed for a constant speed of light.	0
What was a problem for classical physics?	Black body radiation provided another problem for classical physics, which was corrected when Planck proposed that light comes in individual packets known as photons; this, along with the photoelectric effect and a complete theory predicting discrete energy levels of electron orbitals, led to the theory of quantum mechanics taking over from classical physics at very small scales.Quantum mechanics would come to be pioneered by Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schrödinger and Paul Dirac.	1
What was a problem for classical physics?	From this early work, and work in related fields, the Standard Model of particle physics was derived.	0
What was a problem for classical physics?	Following the discovery of a particle with properties consistent with the Higgs boson at CERN in 2012, all fundamental particles predicted by the standard model, and no others, appear to exist; however physics beyond the Standard Model, with theories such as supersymmetry, is an active area of research.	0

What are large enzymes that make antibiotics called?	Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of a cell's genome.	0
What are large enzymes that make antibiotics called?	When mutations occur, they can either have no effect, alter the product of a gene, or prevent the gene from functioning.	0
What are large enzymes that make antibiotics called?	Based on studies in the fly "Drosophila melanogaster", it has been suggested that if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene, this will probably be harmful, with about 70% of these mutations having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial.Mutations can involve large sections of a chromosome becoming duplicated (usually by genetic recombination), which can introduce extra copies of a gene into a genome.	0
What are large enzymes that make antibiotics called?	Extra copies of genes are a major source of the raw material needed for new genes to evolve.	0
What are large enzymes that make antibiotics called?	This is important because most new genes evolve within gene families from pre-existing genes that share common ancestors.	0
What are large enzymes that make antibiotics called?	For example, the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light: three for colour vision and one for night vision; all four are descended from a single ancestral gene.New genes can be generated from an ancestral gene when a duplicate copy mutates and acquires a new function.	0
What are large enzymes that make antibiotics called?	This process is easier once a gene has been duplicated because it increases the redundancy of the system; one gene in the pair can acquire a new function while the other copy continues to perform its original function.	0
What are large enzymes that make antibiotics called?

What did Bekenstein propose about black holes?	Therefore, Bekenstein proposed that a black hole should have an entropy, and that it should be proportional to its horizon area.The link with the laws of thermodynamics was further strengthened by Hawking's discovery that quantum field theory predicts that a black hole radiates blackbody radiation at a constant temperature.	1
What did Bekenstein propose about black holes?	This seemingly causes a violation of the second law of black hole mechanics, since the radiation will carry away energy from the black hole causing it to shrink.	0

The radiation, however also carries away entropy, and it can be proven under general assumptions that the sum of the entropy of the matter surrounding a black hole and one quarter of the area of the horizon as measured in Planck units is in fact always increasing.	0
What did Bekenstein propose about black holes?	This allows the formulation of the first law of black hole mechanics as an analogue of the first law of thermodynamics, with the mass acting as energy, the surface gravity as temperature and the area as entropy.One puzzling feature is that the entropy of a black hole scales with its area rather than with its volume, since entropy is normally an extensive quantity that scales linearly with the volume of the system.	0

According to Dobrev, whose image is the Sphinx based off of?	Rainer Stadelmann, former director of the German Archaeological Institute in Cairo, examined the distinct iconography of the "nemes" (headdress) and the now-detached beard of the Sphinx and concluded that the style is more indicative of the Pharaoh Khufu (2589–2566 BC), builder of the Great Pyramid of Giza and Khafra's father.	0
According to Dobrev, whose image is the Sphinx based off of?	He supports this by suggesting that Khafra's Causeway was built to conform to a pre-existing structure, which, he concludes, given its location, could only have been the Sphinx.Colin Reader, an English geologist who independently conducted a more recent survey of the enclosure, agrees that the various quarries on the site have been excavated around the Causeway.	0
According to Dobrev, whose image is the Sphinx based off of?	Because these quarries are known to have been used by Khufu, Reader concludes that the Causeway (and the temples on either end thereof) must predate Khufu, thereby casting doubt on the conventional Egyptian chronology.In 2004, Vassil Dobrev of the Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale in Cairo announced that he had uncovered new evidence that the Great Sphinx may have been the work of the little-known Pharaoh Djedefre (2528–2520 BC), Khafra's half brother and a son of Khufu.	0
According to Dobrev, whose image is the Sphinx based off of?	Dobrev suggests that Djedefre built the Sphinx in the image of his father Khufu, identifying him with the sun god Ra in order to restore respect for their dynasty.	1
According to Dobrev, whose image is the Sphinx based off of?	Dobrev also notes, like Stadelmann and others, that the causeway connecting Khafre's pyramid to the temples was built around the Sphinx suggesting it was already in existence at the time.	0

Name a written source that is suggested to have inspired van Gogh in this work?	The "literal" includes both "he painted what he saw" and the "hallucinatory genius" arguments (as an individual's hallucinations are indistinguishable from real life) while the "literary" suggest that inspiration blossomed from some written source; most often cited for van Gogh's "Starry Night" are The Bible, Walt Whitman and Victor Hugo.Legendary 20th century art historian Albert Boime is generally credited with the best "literal" theory by proving, in conjunction with three Astronomer colleagues at UCLA the position of the stars from van Gogh's window in the asylum at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence at 4 a.m. on June 19, 1889, the day van Gogh wrote his brother that he had completed the painting.	1

Name a written source that is suggested to have inspired van Gogh in this work?	In his 800-plus existing letters, however, van Gogh makes no mention of ever reading Flammarion.As to the leading "literary" theories: those about The Bible range from van Gogh painting a passage out of Genesis 37 describing a dream of Joseph to an apocalyptic depiction out of the twelfth book of Revelation to a "sublimated Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane"; while those from Whitman attempt to correlate the painting's poetic vision within Song of Myself; and (what has been mistakenly attributed to Hugo's Les Miserables) as an inspired depiction of God as "a lighthouse in eclipse.	0
Name a written source that is suggested to have inspired van Gogh in this work?	"This bevy of interpretations has helped keep van Gogh's "Starry Night" firmly within the discussions and lively debates of both public and academic art history.	0

What did a quarter million construction workers reach their lifetime limits on	The worst of the radioactive debris was collected inside what was left of the reactor, much of it shoveled in by liquidators wearing heavy protective gear (dubbed "bio-robots" by the military); these workers could only spend a maximum of 40 seconds at a time working on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings because of the extremely high doses of radiation given off by the blocks of graphite and other debris.	0
What did a quarter million construction workers reach their lifetime limits on	The reactor itself was covered with bags of sand, lead and boric acid dropped from helicopters: some 5,000 metric tons of material were dropped during the week that followed the accident.At the time there was still fear that the reactor could re-enter a self-sustaining nuclear chain-reaction and explode again, and a new containment structure was planned to prevent rain entering and triggering such an explosion, and to prevent further release of radioactive material.	0
What did a quarter million construction workers reach their lifetime limits on	This was the largest civil engineering task in history, involving a quarter of a million construction workers who all reached their official lifetime limits of radiation.	1
What did a quarter million construction workers reach their lifetime limits on	By December 1986, a large concrete sarcophagus had been erected to seal off the reactor and its contents.	0
What did a quarter million construction workers reach their lifetime limits on	A unique "clean up" medal was given to the workers.Many of the vehicles used by the "liquidators" remain parked in a field in the Chernobyl area.During the construction of the sarcophagus, a scientific team re-entered the reactor as part of an investigation dubbed "Complex Expedition", to locate and contain nuclear fuel in a way that could not lead to another explosion.	0
What did a quarter million construction workers reach their lifetime limits on	These scientists manually collected cold fuel rods, but great heat was still emanating from the core.	0
What did a quarter million construction workers reach their lifetime limits on	Rates of radiation in different parts of the building were monitored by drilling holes into the reactor and inserting long metal detector tubes.	0
What did a quarter million construction workers reach their lifetime limits on	The scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation and radioactive dust.After six months of investigation, in December 1986, they discovered with the help of a remote camera an intensely radioactive mass in the basement of Unit Four, more than two metres wide and weighing hundreds of tons, which they called "the elephant's foot" for its wrinkled appearance.	0
What did a quarter million construction workers reach their lifetime limits on	The mass was composed of sand, glass and a large amount of nuclear fuel that had escaped from the reactor.	0
What did a quarter million construction workers reach their lifetime limits on	The concrete beneath the reactor was steaming hot, and was breached by solidified lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms termed chernobylite.	0

Can sense and antisense sequences exist on different parts of the same strand of DNA	In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, antisense RNA sequences are produced, but the functions of these RNAs are not entirely clear.	0
Can sense and antisense sequences exist on different parts of the same strand of DNA	One proposal is that antisense RNAs are involved in regulating gene expression through RNA-RNA base pairing.A few DNA sequences in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and more in plasmids and viruses, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping genes.	0
Can sense and antisense sequences exist on different parts of the same strand of DNA	In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read in the opposite direction along the other strand.	0
Can sense and antisense sequences exist on different parts of the same strand of DNA	In bacteria, this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription, while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.	0
Why are the locations of the sea important?	Over the course of millions of years, the motion of tectonic plates reconfigures global land and ocean areas and generates topography.	0
Why are the locations of the sea important?	This can affect both global and local patterns of climate and atmosphere-ocean circulation.The position of the continents determines the geometry of the oceans and therefore influences patterns of ocean circulation.	0
Why are the locations of the sea important?	The locations of the seas are important in controlling the transfer of heat and moisture across the globe, and therefore, in determining global climate.	1
Why are the locations of the sea important?	A recent example of tectonic control on ocean circulation is the formation of the Isthmus of Panama about 5 million years ago, which shut off direct mixing between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.	0
Why are the locations of the sea important?	This strongly affected the ocean dynamics of what is now the Gulf Stream and may have led to Northern Hemisphere ice cover.	0
Why are the locations of the sea important?	During the Carboniferous period, about 300 to 360 million years ago, plate tectonics may have triggered large-scale storage of carbon and increased glaciation.	0
Why are the locations of the sea important?	Geologic evidence points to a "megamonsoonal" circulation pattern during the time of the supercontinent Pangaea, and climate modeling suggests that the existence of the supercontinent was conducive to the establishment of monsoons.The size of continents is also important.	0
Why are the locations of the sea important?	Because of the stabilizing effect of the oceans on temperature, yearly temperature variations are generally lower in coastal areas than they are inland.	0
Why are the locations of the sea important?	A larger supercontinent will therefore have more area in which climate is strongly seasonal than will several smaller continents or islands.	0

When did the museum announce it was stopping the project	 extinct and endangered species.Cloning, or more precisely, the reconstruction of functional DNA from extinct species has, for decades, been a dream of some scientists.	0
When did the museum announce it was stopping the project	Current cloning techniques have an average success rate of less than 5 percent, even when working with familiar species; cloning wild animals is usually less than 1 percent successful.	0
When did the museum announce it was stopping the project	The possible implications of this were dramatized in the best-selling novel by Michael Crichton and high budget Hollywood thriller "Jurassic Park".	0
When did the museum announce it was stopping the project	Early hopes to save species through cloning have been dashed as the difficulties of cloning any species have made progress very slow.	0
When did the museum announce it was stopping the project	Several tissue banks have come into existence, including the "Frozen Zoo" at the San Diego Zoo, to store frozen tissue from the world's rarest and most endangered species.In 2001, a cow named Bessie gave birth to a cloned Asian gaur, an endangered species, but the calf died after two days.	0
When did the museum announce it was stopping the project	In 2003, a banteng was successfully cloned, followed by three African wildcats from a thawed frozen embryo.	0
When did the museum announce it was stopping the project	These successes provided hope that similar techniques (using surrogate mothers of another species) might be used to clone extinct species.	0
When did the museum announce it was stopping the project	Anticipating this possibility, tissue samples from the last "bucardo" (Pyrenean Ibex) were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after it died in 2000.	0
When did the museum announce it was stopping the project	Researchers are also considering cloning endangered species such as the giant panda and cheetah.In 2002, geneticists at the Australian Museum announced that they had replicated DNA of the Thylacine (Tasmanian Tiger), at the time extinct for about 65 years, using polymerase chain reaction.	0
When did the museum announce it was stopping the project	However, on February 15, 2005 the museum announced that it was stopping the project after tests showed the specimens' DNA had been too badly degraded by the (ethanol) preservative.	1
When did the museum announce it was stopping the project	On 15 May 2005 it was announced that the Thylacine project would be revived, with new participation from researchers in New South Wales and Victoria.In January 2009, for the first time, an extinct animal, the Pyrenean ibex mentioned above was cloned, at the Centre of Food Technology and Research of Aragon, using the preserved DNA of the skin samples from 2001 and domestic goat egg-cells.	0
When did the museum announce it was stopping the project	The ibex died shortly after birth due to physical defects in its lungs.One of the most anticipated targets for cloning was once the Woolly Mammoth, but attempts to extract DNA from frozen mammoths have been unsuccessful, though a joint Russo-Japanese team is currently working toward this goal.	0
When did the museum announce it was stopping the project	In January 2011, it was reported by Yomiuri Shimbun that a team of scientists headed by Akira Iritani of Kyoto University had built upon research by Dr. Wakayama, saying that they will extract DNA from a mammoth carcass that had been preserved in a Russian laboratory and insert it into the egg cells of an African elephant in hopes of producing a mammoth embryo.	0
When did the museum announce it was stopping the project	The researchers said they hoped to produce a baby mammoth within six years.Scientists at the University of Newcastle and University of New South Wales announced in March 2013 that the very recently extinct gastric-brooding frog would be the subject of a cloning attempt to resurrect the species.	0
In what year was the Framework Convention agreed?	Discourse about global warming.Political discussion.Most countries are Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).The ultimate objective of the Convention is to prevent dangerous human interference of the climate system.As is stated in the Convention, this requires that GHG concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change, food production is not threatened, and economic development can proceed in a sustainable fashion.	0
In what year was the Framework Convention agreed?	The Framework Convention was agreed in 1992, but since then, global emissions have risen.	1
In what year was the Framework Convention agreed?	During negotiations, the G77 (a lobbying group in the United Nations representing 133 developing nations) pushed for a mandate requiring developed countries to " the lead" in reducing their emissions.	0
In what year was the Framework Convention agreed?	This was justified on the basis that: the developed world's emissions had contributed most to the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere; per-capita emissions (i.e., emissions per head of population) were still relatively low in developing countries; and the emissions of developing countries would grow to meet their development needs.	0
In what year was the Framework Convention agreed?	This mandate was sustained in the Kyoto Protocol to the Framework Convention, which entered into legal effect in 2005.In ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, most developed countries accepted legally binding commitments to limit their emissions.	0
In what year was the Framework Convention agreed?	These first-round commitments expired in 2012.US President George W. Bush rejected the treaty on the basis that "it exempts 80% of the world, including major population centers such as China and India, from compliance, and would cause serious harm to the US economy.	0
In what year was the Framework Convention agreed?	"At the 15th UNFCCC Conference of the Parties, held in 2009 at Copenhagen, several UNFCCC Parties produced the Copenhagen Accord.Parties associated with the Accord (140 countries, as of November 2010)aim to limit the future increase in global mean temperature to below .	0
In what year was the Framework Convention agreed?	A preliminary assessment published in November 2010 by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) suggests a possible "emissions gap" between the voluntary pledges made in the Accord and the emissions cuts necessary to have a "likely" (greater than 66% probability) chance of meeting the objective.The UNEP assessment takes the objective as being measured against the pre-industrial global mean temperature level.	0
In what year was the Framework Convention agreed?	To having a likely chance of meeting the objective, assessed studies generally indicated the need for global emissions to peak before 2020, with substantial declines in emissions thereafter.The 16th Conference of the Parties (COP16) was held at Cancún in 2010.	0
In what year was the Framework Convention agreed?	It produced an agreement, not a binding treaty, that the Parties should take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to meet a goal of limiting global warming to above pre-industrial temperatures.	0
In what year was the Framework Convention agreed?	It also recognized the need to consider strengthening the goal to a global average rise of .	0

Into what three major categories can the elements be classified into?	The nonmetals are simply subdivided into the polyatomic nonmetals which, being nearest the metalloids, show some incipient metallic character; the diatomic nonmetals, which are essentially nonmetallic; and the monatomic noble gases, which are almost completely inert and nonmetallic.	0
Into what three major categories can the elements be classified into?	Specialized groupings such as the refractory metals and the noble metals, which are subsets (in this example) of the transition metals, are also known and occasionally denoted.Placing the elements into categories and subcategories based on shared properties is imperfect.	0
Into what three major categories can the elements be classified into?	There is a spectrum of properties within each category and it is not hard to find overlaps at the boundaries, as is the case with most classification schemes.	0
Into what three major categories can the elements be classified into?	Beryllium, for example, is classified as an alkaline earth metal although its amphoteric chemistry and tendency to mostly form covalent compounds are both attributes of a chemically weak or other metal.	0
Into what three major categories can the elements be classified into?	Radon is classified as a nonmetal and a noble gas yet has some cationic chemistry that is more characteristic of a metal.	0
Into what three major categories can the elements be classified into?	Other classification schemes are possible such as the division of the elements into mineralogical occurrence categories, or crystalline structures.	0
Into what three major categories can the elements be classified into?	Categorising the elements in this fashion dates back to at least 1869 when Hinrichs wrote that simple boundary lines could be drawn on the periodic table to show elements having like properties, such as the metals and the nonmetals, or the gaseous elements.	0

Nervous tissue is derived from what?	All vertebrates are built along the basic chordate body plan: a stiff rod running through the length of the animal (vertebral column or notochord), with a hollow tube of nervous tissue, the spinal cord above it and the gastrointestinal tract below.	0
Nervous tissue is derived from what?	Nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm, connective tissues are derived from mesoderm, and gut is derived from the endoderm.	1
Nervous tissue is derived from what?	At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut.	0
Nervous tissue is derived from what?	The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the anus at the base of the tail.	0
Nervous tissue is derived from what?	The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column, in which the notochord has been replaced by a segmented series of stiffer elements (vertebrae) separated by mobile joints (intervertebral discs), which each contain a soft central core (nucleus pulposus), derived from the notochord of the embryo.	0
Nervous tissue is derived from what?	However, a few vertebrates have secondarily lost this anatomy, retaining the notochord into adulthood.	0
Nervous tissue is derived from what?	These include the sturgeon and the coelacanth.	0
Nervous tissue is derived from what?	Jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost.	0

Nervous tissue is derived from what?	This is one of the arguments put forward by Charles Darwin to support his theory of evolution.	0
What is the "Mars effect"?	Astrology has not demonstrated its effectiveness in controlled studies and has no scientific validity, and as such, is regarded as pseudoscience.	0
What is the "Mars effect"?	Where astrology has made falsifiable predictions, it has been falsified.	0
What is the "Mars effect"?	Shawn Carlson's double-blind chart matching test, in which twenty eight astrologers agreed to match over 100 natal charts to psychological profiles generated by the California Psychological Inventory (CPI) test, is one of the most renowned tests of astrology.	0
What is the "Mars effect"?	The experimental protocol used in Carlson's study was agreed to by a group of physicists and astrologers prior to the experiment.	0
What is the "Mars effect"?	Astrologers, nominated by the National Council for Geocosmic Research, acted as the astrological advisors, and helped to ensure, and agreed, that the test was fair.	0
What is the "Mars effect"?	They also chose twentysix of the twentyeight astrologers for the tests, the other two being interested astrologers who volunteered afterwards.	0
What is the "Mars effect"?	The astrologers, from Europe and the United States, helped to draw up the central proposition of natal astrology to be tested.	0
What is the "Mars effect"?	Published in "Nature" in 1985, the study found that predictions based on natal astrology were no better than chance, and that the testing "clearly refutes the astrological hypothesis".In 1955, astrologer and psychologist Michel Gauquelin stated that although he had failed to find evidence to support such indicators as the zodiacal signs and planetary aspects in astrology, he had found positive correlations between the diurnal positions of some of the planets and success in some professions which astrology traditionally associates with those planets.	0
What is the "Mars effect"?	The best-known of Gauquelin's findings is based on the positions of Mars in the natal charts of successful athletes and became known as the "Mars effect".	1
What is the "Mars effect"?	A study conducted by seven French scientists attempted to replicate the claim, but found no statistical evidence.	0
What is the "Mars effect"?	They attributed the effect to selective bias on Gauquelin's part, accusing him of attempting to persuade them to add or delete names from their study.Geoffrey Dean has suggested that the effect may be caused by self-reporting of birth dates by parents rather than any issue with the study by Gauquelin.	0
What is the "Mars effect"?	The suggestion is that a small subset of the parents may have had changed birth times to be consistent with better astrological charts for a related profession.	0
What is the "Mars effect"?	The sample group was taken from a time where belief in astrology was more common.	0
What is the "Mars effect"?	Gauquelin had failed to find the Mars effect in more recent populations, where a nurse or doctor recorded the birth information.	0
What is the "Mars effect"?	The number of births under astrologically undesirable conditions was also lower, indicating more evidence that parents choose dates and times to suit their beliefs.Dean, a scientist and former astrologer, and psychologist Ivan Kelly conducted a large scale scientific test, involving more than one hundred cognitive, behavioural, physical and other variables, but found no support for astrology.	0
What is the "Mars effect"?	Furthermore, a meta-analysis was conducted pooling 40 studies consisting of 700 astrologers and over 1,000 birth charts.	0
What is the "Mars effect"?	Ten of the tests, which had a total of 300 participating, involved the astrologers picking the correct chart interpretation out of a number of others which were not the astrologically correct chart interpretation (usually 3 to 5 others).	0
What is the "Mars effect"?	When the date and other obvious clues were removed no significant results were found to suggest there was any preferred chart.	0
