Stone Mountain-Abstract,"Article: Stone Mountain<br/>Section: Abstract<br/><br/>1. Stone Mountain is a quartz monzonite dome monadnock and the site of Stone Mountain Park in Stone Mountain, Georgia, United States.<br/>2. At its summit, the elevation is MSL and above the surrounding area.<br/>3.  is well-known not only for its geology, but also for the enormous bas-relief on its north face, the largest bas-relief in the world.<br/>4. The carving depicts three figures of the Confederate States of America: Stonewall Jackson, Robert E. Lee, and Jefferson Davis.Stone Mountain was once owned by the Venable Brothers.<br/>5. It was used as a rock quarry and was also the site of a cross burning and Ku Klux Klan activities.<br/>6. It was purchased by the State of Georgia in 1958.Stone Mountain is more than in circumference at its base.<br/>7. The summit of the mountain can be reached by a walk-up trail on the west side of the mountain or by the Skyride aerial tram.<br/>"
Stone Mountain-Geology,"Article: Stone Mountain<br/>Section: Geology<br/><br/>1. Stone Mountain is a pluton, a type of igneous intrusion.<br/>2. Primarily composed of quartz monzonite, the dome of Stone Mountain was formed during the formation of the Blue Ridge Mountains, part of the Appalachian Mountains.<br/>3. It formed as a result of the upwelling of magma from within the Earth's crust.<br/>4. This magma solidified to form granite within the crust five to ten miles below the surface.<br/>5.  pluton continues underground at its longest point into Gwinnett County.<br/>6. Numerous reference books and Georgia literature have dubbed Stone Mountain as â€œthe largest exposed piece of granite in the world"".<br/>7. This misnomer is most likely a result of advertisement by granite companies and early park administration.<br/>8. , though often called a pink granite dome, actually ranges in composition from quartz monzonite to granite and granodiorite.The minerals within the rock include quartz, plagioclase feldspar, microcline and muscovite, with smaller amounts of biotite and tourmaline.<br/>9. The tourmaline is mostly black in color, and the majority of it exists as optically continuous skeletal crystals, but much larger, euhedral pegmatitic tourmaline crystals can also be found in the mountain's numerous, cross-cutting felsic dikes.Embedded in the granite are xenoliths or pieces of foreign rocks entrained in the magma.The granite intruded into the metamorphic rocks of the Piedmont region during the last stages of the Alleghenian Orogeny, which was the time when North America and North Africa collided.<br/>10. Over time, erosion eventually exposed the present mountain of more resistant igneous rock.<br/>11. This intrusion of granite also gave rise to Panola Mountain in DeKalb County, smaller outcroppings further east of Stone Mountain.<br/>"
Stone Mountain-Natural history,"Article: Stone Mountain<br/>Section: Natural history<br/><br/>1. The top of the mountain is a landscape of bare rock and rock pools, and it provides views of the surrounding area including the skyline of downtown Atlanta, often Kennesaw Mountain, and on very clear days even the Appalachian Mountains.<br/>2. On some days, the top of the mountain is shrouded in a heavy fog, and visibility may be limited to only a few feet.<br/>3. The clear freshwater pools of the summit form by rainwater gathering in eroded depressions, and are home to unusual clam shrimp and fairy shrimp.<br/>4. The tiny shrimp appear only during the rainy season.<br/>5. Through the process of cryptobiosis, the tiny shrimp eggs (or cysts) can remain dormant for years in the dried out depressions, awaiting favorable conditions.<br/>6. The mountain's lower slopes are wooded.<br/>7. The rare Georgia oak was first discovered at the summit, and several specimens can easily be found along the walk-up trail and in the woods around the base of the mountain.<br/>8. In the fall, the extremely rare Confederate Yellow Daisy (""Helianthus porteri"") flowers appear on the mountain, growing in rock crevices and in the large wooded areas.<br/>"
Stone Mountain-Confederate Memorial,"Article: Stone Mountain<br/>Section: Confederate Memorial<br/><br/>1. The largest bas relief sculpture in the world, the Confederate Memorial Carving depicts three Confederate leaders of the Civil War, President Jefferson Davis and Generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas J.<br/>2. ""Stonewall"" Jackson (and their favorite horses, ""Blackjack"", ""Traveller"", and ""Little Sorrel"", respectively).<br/>3. The entire carved surface measures , about the size of two and a quarter football fields.<br/>4. The carving of the three men towers above the ground, measures 90 by , and is recessed into the mountain.<br/>5. The deepest point of the carving is at Lee's elbow, which is to the mountain's surface.The carving was conceived by Mrs. C. Helen Plane, a charter member of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC).<br/>6. The Venable Brothers, owners of the mountain, deeded the north face of the mountain to the UDC in 1916.<br/>7. The UDC was given 12 years to complete a sizable Civil War monument.<br/>8. Gutzon Borglum was commissioned to do the carving.<br/>9. Borglum abandoned the project in 1925 (and later went on to begin Mount Rushmore).<br/>10. American sculptor Augustus Lukeman continued until 1928, when further work stopped for thirty years.<br/>11. In 1958, at the urging of Governor Marvin Griffin, the Georgia legislature approved a measure to purchase Stone Mountain for $1,125,000.<br/>12. In 1963, Walker Hancock was selected to complete the carving, and work began in 1964.<br/>13. The carving was completed by Roy Faulkner, who later operated a museum (now closed) on nearby Memorial Drive commemorating the carving's history.<br/>14. The carving was considered complete on March 3, 1972.<br/>"
Stone Mountain-Carving and the Ku Klux Klan,"Article: Stone Mountain<br/>Section: Carving and the Ku Klux Klan<br/><br/>1. The revival of the Ku Klux Klan was emboldened by the release of D. W. Griffith's Klan-glorifying film ""The Birth of a Nation"", and by the lynching of Leo Frank, who was convicted in the murder of Mary Phagan.<br/>2. On November 25, 1915, a group of robed and hooded men met at Stone Mountain to create a new incarnation of the Klan.<br/>3. They were led by William J. Simmons, and they included a group calling itself the Knights of Mary Phagan.<br/>4. A cross was lit, and the oath was administered by Nathan Bedford Forrest II, the grandson of Gen. Nathan B. Forrest, and was witnessed by the owner of Stone Mountain, Samuel Venable.Fundraising for the monument resumed in 1923, and in October of that year, Venable granted the Klan easement with perpetual right to hold celebrations as they desired.<br/>5. The influence of the UDC continued, in support of Mrs.<br/>6. Plane's vision of a carving explicitly for the purpose of creating a Confederate memorial.<br/>7. The UDC established the Stone Mountain Confederate Memorial Association (SMCMA) for fundraising and on-site supervision of the project.<br/>8. Venable and Gutzon Borglum, who were both closely associated with the Klan, arranged to pack the SMCMA with Klan members.<br/>9. The SMCMA, along with the United Daughters of the Confederacy continued fundraising efforts.<br/>10. Of the $250,000 raised, part came from the federal government, which in 1924 issued special fifty-cent coins with the soldiers Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson on them, but would not allow the politician Jefferson Davis to be included.<br/>11. When the state purchased the mountain in 1958, they had removed the Klan and voided Venable's agreement by condemning the properties.<br/>"
